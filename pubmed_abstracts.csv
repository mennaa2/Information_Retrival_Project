cancer,"The ability to escape immune surveillance is a hallmark of malignancy. Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) facilitates tumor progression by binding to the immune inhibitory receptor known as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) on immune cells, resulting in suppression of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte function. The degree of PD-L1 expression may have a prognostic value in some cancer types, and it may vary according to the genetic makeup and the ethnicity of patients. The expression level of PD-L1 in 63 cases of primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumor tissues was evaluated using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Also, PD-L1 association with various clinicopathologic characteristics and overall survival was studied. The positive expression rate of PD-L1 in HNSCC was 85.7%, 60.3%, and 52.3% of the total number of cases using combined positive score (CPS) >/= 1, CPS >/= 5, and CPS >/= 20 cutoff values, respectively. Statistical analysis revealed no significant relationship between the expression of PD-L1 protein and clinicopathological features except for tobacco use using a cutoff CPS >/= 20. The log-rank chi-square results showed that PD-L1 was not a significant factor affecting the 4-year overall survival of HNSCC patients. Also, the overall survival rate was not significantly affected by the patient's age, tumor differentiation, tumor size, and lymphovascular invasion. However, survival curves demonstrated lower overall survival in HNSCC female patients, disease recurrence, and positive perineural invasion. Our findings showed relatively high PDL-1 expression in most HNSCC patients. No significant association was found between PD-L1 protein expression and overall survival."
cancer,"IMPORTANCE: Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act broadened eligibility for government-funded health coverage. This may have improved access to early diagnosis and rapid treatment, potentially impacting survival in patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a leading cause of cancer-related death in the US. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between state-level Medicaid expansion and all-cause mortality in patients with resectable NSCLC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study of patients aged 20 to 64 years who were diagnosed with stage I to IIIA NSCLC used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry collected between January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2019, with outcomes administratively censored at 2 and 4 years. Data were analyzed between March 1 and September 10, 2025. EXPOSURE: Medicaid expansion status of patients' state of residence at diagnosis. Patients' states of residence were categorized as nonexpansion, early expansion (2011), 2014 expansion, or late expansion (after 2014). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were 2- and 4-year all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards regression models within a difference-in-differences framework were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for death. Secondary analyses evaluated postexpansion mortality trends and changes in early-stage (I-II) diagnoses using logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 53 842 patients included in the analysis (24 849 [46.2%] 60-64 years of age; 27 027 [50.2%] male), propensity score-matched analyses showed lower 2-year mortality in states with early expansion (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-0.99; P = .02) and 2014 expansion (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86-0.95; P < .001) compared with nonexpansion control states, whereas no significant difference was observed in late expansion states (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.89-1.02; P = .15). All expansion groups showed decreased mortality. Mortality decreases were observed after the first 3 years and persisted throughout the study period. The proportion of early-stage diagnoses did not change post expansion, suggesting benefits may have been mediated by improved postdiagnostic care rather than earlier detection. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of patients with stage I to IIIA NSCLC, Medicaid expansion was associated with lower mortality at 2 and 4 years. These findings suggest that expanded insurance coverage may have enhanced access to effective cancer care and improved population-level outcomes."

cancer,"Contamination of food products such as rice with mycotoxins, especially aflatoxins (AFs), can endanger human health and cause economic problems. Dietary exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a public health concern, especially in countries where rice is a staple food, due to its carcinogenic, acute, and chronic effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the occurrence and concentration levels of AFB1 in domestic (Iranian) rice samples. The presence and mean concentration of AFB1 in 70 Iranian rice samples collected from local markets in Tehran, Iran were measured using a competitive ELISA method. Furthermore, a health risk assessment was performed based on estimated daily intake (EDI) of AFB1 from rice consumption, margin of exposure (MOE), and liver cancer risk in Iranian children and adults. AFB1 was detected in 26 samples (37.1%) with the mean concentration levels of 1.86 +/- 0.67 ng/g (ranges from 1.12 to 4.26); of these, 7 samples (26.9%) had values exceeding the limit set by European Union regulations (2 ng/g). Additionally, AFB1 contamination in no rice sample exceeded the maximum limit accepted by Iranian National Standardisation Organisation (5 ng/g). This study showed that the mean EDI of AFB1 was 9 and 3 ng/kg bw/day for children and adults, respectively. In addition, the mean MOEs for children and adults were 18 and 64, respectively, indicating a public health concern. In addition, the present study showed that the risks of liver cancer associated with rice consumption among Iranian children and adults were 0.13 and 0.04 cancer cases/year/per 10(5) people, respectively. This study showed that monitoring AFB1 levels in rice is essential for assessing food safety and protecting public health, particularly in developing countries where rice is a staple food."
cancer,"BackgroundPancreatic cancer has poor outcomes, with vascular invasion being a critical factor in determining resectability and prognosis. Accurate assessment of vascular invasion remains challenging.PurposeTo investigate the predictors of vascular invasion and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing surgery after chemotherapy using computed tomography (CT) and histopathological data, and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CT-based vascular scoring system.Material and MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 98 patients with pancreatic cancer showing vascular encasement on CT who underwent chemotherapy before surgery. Two reviewers evaluated baseline and preoperative CT to assess resectability. Clinicohistopathological factors were assessed. RFS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The predictors were identified using Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models. A 3-point scoring system quantified vascular involvement at baseline and preoperative CT, with total scores combining both time points.ResultsOf the 98 patients, 32 (32.7%) had pathologically confirmed vascular invasion. Change in tumor size (odds ratio [OR]=3.1; P = 0.022), T stage (OR=15.4; P = 0.038), and perineural invasion (OR=13.2; P = 0.028) predicted vascular invasion. Total vascular scores strongly correlated with vascular invasion (areas under the curve=0.924 and 0.803). Median RFS was 21 months, influenced by lymph node involvement at baseline and preoperative CT (hazard ratio [HR]=2.3; P = 0.009 and HR=2.6; P = 0.013, respectively), tumor differentiation (HR=3.3; P = 0.047), and elevated CA 19-9 (HR=2.8; P = 0.019).ConclusionChanges in tumor size on CT, T stage, and perineural invasion predict vascular invasion. In addition, a CT-based scoring systems can accurately predict vascular invasion after chemotherapy."
cancer,"IntroductionRapid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an increasingly important role in radiotherapy. It improves the accuracy of delineation of target volumes and organs at risk (OARs), but generating accurate synthetic CT(sCT) from MRI remains challenging, and the lack of electron density information limits its further clinical application. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a CBAMPix2Pix model for MRI to CT synthesis.MethodsWe adapted the CBAMPix2Pix architecture, incorporating convolutional block attention module(CBAM), to synthesize CT images from 17260 MRI slices of 86 patients with metastatic brain cancer. The model analyzes local features to enhance image authenticity and is designed to map T1-weighted Contrast-enhanced (T1wc) to sCT. To address the data imbalance between normal tissue and bone, we introduce structural similarity loss(SSIM) to enhance local features of learning images, thereby better reducing differences in Hounsfield Unit(HU).ResultsWe evaluate the performance of the model through quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our proposed model achieves higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 27.5 +/- 3.3 dB, normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) of 0.019 +/- 0.023, and structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.857 +/- 0.059 for sCT images in MR simulation sequences, and the average mean absolute error(MAE) was 74.48 +/- 22.88 HU in body and 185.89 +/- 21.59 HU in bone. The P-values of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for the CBAMPix2Pix model compared with the other two models in PSNR, SSIM, MAE, and NMAE were all less than 0.05 in the test cohorts.ConclusionWe have developed a novel CBAMPix2Pix model that can effectively generate realistic sCT images comparable to real images, potentially improving the accuracy of MRI-based treatment planning."
cancer,"IntroductionLocally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) remains a therapeutic challenge, with significant risks of both locoregional and distant relapse. Total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT), which combines induction chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy (CRT) prior to surgery, has emerged as a potentially more effective strategy than traditional approaches, yet data from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remain limited. This study evaluates the efficacy and toxicity of induction FOLFIRINOX followed by concurrent CRT in Vietnamese patients with lower-middle LARC.MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on adult patients (n = 72) with clinical stage T3-T4 M0 rectal adenocarcinoma. All patients received induction FOLFIRINOX for six cycles and preoperative CRT, followed by total meso-rectal excision (TME), and adjuvant chemotherapy as indicated. The primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR, ypT0N0); secondary endpoints were 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and safety. The study conforms to STROBE guidelines.ResultsPathological complete response was achieved in 25.0% of patients. The 3-year DFS reached 90.6%. Treatment feasibility was high, with 93.06% completing all 6 induction cycles; hematologic adverse events, particularly leukopenia and neutropenia, were the most common toxicities but were generally manageable with supportive care, while nonhematological toxicities were predominantly mild. R0 resection rate was 100% and sphincter-preserving surgery was 86.1%.ConclusionIn a LMIC setting, induction FOLFIRINOX followed by CRT shows promising efficacy and tolerable toxicity in LARC. These findings support early, intensified systemic therapy to enhance local control and mitigate metastatic spread."
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Inhibin subunit beta B (INHBB), a member of the TGF-beta superfamily, has emerged as a potential regulator of tumor progression and immune modulation. However, its clinical and immunological significance in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. METHODS: This study evaluated INHBB mRNA expression in 248 CRC cases using RNA in situ hybridization (RNAscope), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Associations with clinicopathological parameters, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, and prognosis were analyzed. RESULTS: INHBB was primarily expressed in tumor epithelial cells and weakly in stromal cells, but was negligible in normal mucosa. High INHBB expression correlated significantly with venous invasion, lymph node metastasis, advanced TNM stage, and reduced tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. IHC revealed marked decreases in CD4(+), CD8(+), and FOXP3(+) T cells and increased CD163(+) tumor-associated macrophages in INHBB high tumors, indicating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that high INHBB expression was associated with worse overall survival and recurrence-free survival, but was not an independent prognostic factor in multivariate models. CONCLUSION: INHBB is predominantly expressed in tumor epithelium and is associated with aggressive features, poor prognosis, and the formation of an immune-cold, macrophage-rich TME in CRC. These findings suggest that INHBB may be a potential biomarker for immune evasion and a target for novel immunotherapeutic strategies in CRC."
cancer,"Pulmonary diseases are still a serious threat to human health today, particularly in light of the recent rise of novel viruses such as SARS, influenza A, and COVID-19, which have made the situation even more dire by worsening the disease's effects on global public health. Isorhamnetin (ISO), as the active component of many medicinal plants and preparations, exhibits good antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-tumor effects. ISO has been proven to have both preventive and treatment efficacy against pulmonary diseases. This review summarizes the effects of ISO in different pulmonary diseases, including COVID-19, pneumonia, acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome, lung cancer, asthma, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and pulmonary fibrosis, highlighting its specific molecular mechanisms against various pulmonary diseases, which is helpful for providing new perspectives on the preclinical trial and clinical application of ISO."
cancer,"GT-14, identified as [(E)-4-((1-(1-methyl-1H-indol-2-yl) ethylidene)amino)phenol], is a novel inhibitor targeting the Galpha(i)2 protein, which is crucial in facilitating cell migration and invasion in prostate, ovarian, and breast cancer cells. therefore a valuable target for treating metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In this study, GT-14's physicochemical properties, permeability, metabolic behavior, and tissue distribution were assessed. The results showed that GT-14 exhibited very slight aqueous solubility at room temperature (0.11 mg/mL) but was soluble in solvents including dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethyl acetamide, and sparingly or slightly soluble in several cosolvents. GT-14 exhibited a distinct pH-dependent solubility profile, being stable across a broad pH range (1.2-7.4) but degrading in strongly basic conditions. It exhibited high permeability (1.3 x 10(-5) cm/s) in Caco-2 cell culture models and therefore identified as a BCS II compound. Hepatic microsomal studies revealed that GT-14 underwent Phase I metabolism, with more than 90% remaining in 60 min incubation in rat liver microsomes. A stable co-solvent formulation was developed to enable intravenous administration for pharmacokinetic studies. Previous pharmacokinetic studies showed that GT-14 exhibited biphasic disposition with a terminal plasma elimination half-life of 268.07 minutes (> 4 hours). Tissue distribution analysis indicated the highest concentration of GT-14 in the prostate, followed by the kidneys, lungs, heart, and liver. Our study presents an early-stage preclinical drug development roadmap that integrates modern technologies for efficiency and success, using GT-14 as a model compound. It showed promising characteristics, reinforcing its potential as a new therapeutic agent for mCRPC."
cancer,"Cancer and autoimmune diseases are major global health challenges characterized by molecular and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional single-analyte biomarkers often lack the sensitivity and specificity required for early detection and personalized therapy, highlighting the need for robust next-generation biomarkers (NGBs). This review provides a concise overview of NGBs in cancer and autoimmune diseases, emphasizing multi-omics integration and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approaches shaping precision diagnostics and therapeutics. A literature search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science over the last 15 years focused on genomics, transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and Microbiomics, particularly studies combining multi-omics datasets with AI/machine learning. Multi-omics and AI reveal dynamic molecular signatures-circulating tumor DNA, microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, proteins, metabolites, and immune profiles. Single-cell and spatial analyses uncover cellular heterogeneity and tissue context, while proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics provide functional insights, enhancing disease detection, patient stratification, and therapy monitoring. Challenges include assay standardization, inter-patient variability, and regulatory hurdles. Multi-omics and AI-powered NGBs promise to transform precision diagnostics and personalized therapy, requiring continued research, standardization, and global collaboration."
cancer,"Circulating tumor cell (CTC) clusters are potent drivers of metastasis in breast cancer, and their survival and dissemination within the circulatory system are critically governed by dynamic interactions with the host microenvironment. Two key mechanisms-""platelet cloaking"" and ""leukocyte escort""-have emerged as central axes that amplify the metastatic potential of these clusters. This review synthesizes these parallel yet intersecting pathways, elucidates the biological basis for their synergistic interplay, and proposes a translational roadmap from mechanistic insight to clinical application. Accumulating evidence indicates that breast cancer CTC clusters originate from the oligoclonal shedding of primary tumor cells, with their structural integrity maintained by the intercellular adhesion molecule plakoglobin. Within the circulation, CTCs form heterogeneous clusters with neutrophils, a phenomenon strongly associated with poor patient prognosis that activates cell cycle programs, supporting the concept of ""proliferation in transit"". Concurrently, platelet cloaking, mediated by molecules such as P-selectin, confers multiple survival advantages: it shields clusters from hemodynamic shear stress, facilitates evasion of immune surveillance (notably NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity), and forms microthrombi that act as ""docking scaffolds"" to enhance extravasation efficiency. While the advent of low-shear microfluidic technologies now enables the precise isolation and functional characterization of these clusters, a significant gap persists in high-level clinical evidence for interventions. Preclinical studies have identified the selectin/integrin network and fibrinogen as highly promising therapeutic targets. Therefore, we propose the implementation of mechanism-driven, exploratory clinical trials guided by biomarkers (e.g., dynamic changes in CTC clusters) and conducted within the perioperative ""window of opportunity"" to validate the clinical feasibility and safety of therapeutically targeting this ""platelet cloaking and leukocyte escort"" axis in breast cancer."
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide, with metastatic disease posing significant therapeutic challenges. While immunotherapy has shown promise, tumor immune evasion limits its efficacy. The basement membrane (BM), a specialized extracellular matrix structure, plays a crucial yet understudied role in breast cancer progression and immune modulation. This study aims to investigate the prognostic value and therapeutic potential of BM-related genes in breast cancer. METHODS: We integrated transcriptomic data from TCGA and GEO databases to construct a BM-related gene signature. Unsupervised clustering stratified patients into molecular subtypes, while differential expression analysis identified key BM-associated genes. Functional enrichment analyses (GO, KEGG, GSEA) elucidated biological pathways, and immune microenvironment characterization was performed using ESTIMATE and CIBERSORT. Machine learning approaches pinpointed critical BM-related genes, which were subsequently validated through in vitro experiments. RESULTS: Breast cancer patients were classified into high- and low-BM groups, with the low-BM cohort exhibiting worse prognosis. Pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment in immune regulation, ECM remodeling, and cytokine signaling. FREM1 emerged as a top protective gene through machine learning. Experimental validation in breast cancer cell lines showed that FREM1 expression was significantly lower in tumor cells compared to normal cells. Upon overexpression of FREM1 in breast cancer cell lines, as confirmed by both qPCR and Western blot, we observed a significant reduction in tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. These findings suggest that FREM1 overexpression impairs the aggressiveness of breast cancer cells, reinforcing its potential as a tumor suppressor. CONCLUSION: Our study establishes BM-related genes as novel prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in breast cancer. FREM1 in particular functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, highlighting its potential for therapeutic exploitation. These findings provide critical insights into BM-mediated tumor progression and suggest new avenues for targeted breast cancer therapy."
cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer globally, and the prognosis of this cancer is still not promising. As a result, a deeper investigation of CRC diagnosis biomarkers and a better knowledge of cancer carcinogenesis is still required. Otherwise, RNAs have the ability to modulate gene expression, which makes them potentially useful as novel markers. tRNA fragments (tRFs) are one of the novel emerging classes of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) produced from tRNAs under the influence of sex hormones and other stress situations. tRFs are crucial regulators of gene silencing, RNA processing, and protein translation. A growing number of studies have shown that tRFs are important in human cancers and can be used as diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic targets. Proliferation, cell cycle, and migration of tumor cells are all regulated by tRFs. Differentially expressed tRFs have been found in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), proliferation, or metastasis process of CRC and are highly expressed in CRC tissues. They may be potential biomarkers and targets for interventions in the clinical treatment of CRC, and have a significant function in the metastasis of CRC. So, we aim to review the role of tRFs in the progression of CRC in order to know more about the functions of tRFs. Although much has been discovered about tRFs, what we currently know is probably only the beginning. So, more research is needed to determine the precise pathways in which tRFs are involved in CRC."
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Routine endoscopic re-evaluation of gastric ulcers (GUs) is widely recommended to exclude malignancy. However, in modern practice, particularly in low-to-intermediate gastric cancer prevalence settings, the diagnostic yield, cost-effectiveness, and necessity of universal surveillance are increasingly debated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate compliance with British and Irish guidelines recommending repeat gastroscopy for GUs, identify predictors of malignancy, and assess the diagnostic yield and healthcare cost of ulcer re-evaluation in a large tertiary centre. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 2132 index GUs from 56,874 gastroscopies performed between May 2006 and August 2024. Demographic, endoscopic, and histological data were collected. Malignancy outcomes were determined by cross-referencing with histology databases. Binary logistic regression identified predictors of malignancy. Surveillance rates, ulcer healing, and inflation-adjusted costs were assessed. RESULTS: Eighty-six ulcers (4%) were diagnosed as gastric malignancies. Of these, 96% were identified at index histology; three were diagnosed at short-interval re-evaluation following inadequate or false-negative biopsies. No malignancies were detected during routine surveillance of benign-appearing ulcers with adequate histology. Macroscopic concern was the strongest predictor of malignancy (odds ratio 66.9, p < 0.01), alongside older age, male sex, and non-antral ulcer location. Surveillance was performed in 59% of benign ulcers at a mean interval of 12.5 weeks. None of the 837 patients with benign ulcers who did not undergo re-evaluation developed gastric cancer during 19 years of follow-up. Re-evaluation procedures represented 2.5% of total endoscopy workload, at a cumulative cost of euro1,028,016. CONCLUSION: Routine re-evaluation of GUs that appear benign and have adequate negative histology provided minimal diagnostic benefit while generating significant healthcare costs. A selective approach, focusing on ulcers with suspicious endoscopic features, inadequate biopsies, or unresolved symptoms, would better allocate resources and avoid unnecessary procedures."
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Pressure injuries are a significant concern in oncologic surgical patients due to factors such as hypoproteinemia and complex surgeries. These injuries impact the quality of care and patient safety. Despite the importance of prevention, nurses often rely on empirical methods, leading to procedural errors. Checklist management, a structured approach to quality control, has shown promise in improving outcomes in various medical contexts. This study aims to explore the clinical application and effectiveness of checklist management in preventing pressure injuries among oncologic surgical patients. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of implementing checklist management on the execution of pressure injury prevention programs among operating room nurses, aiming to establish a standardized operational procedure through the use of a task checklist. METHODS: A convenience sampling method was used to select patients undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia at a tertiary-level cancer hospital in Tianjin between August and December 2022. Patients from August to September 2022 (4658 cases) were assigned to the control group, which implemented conventional pressure injury prevention management. Patients from November to December 2022 (4508 cases) were assigned to the observation group, which implemented checklist-based pressure injury prevention management. Compare the compliance rate of nursing staff in risk assessment, the pass rate of patient positioning, the proper use rate of pressure-relieving dressings, comprehensive knowledge of prevention management, the incidence of pressure injuries, and feedback on the implementation of the Evidence-Based Nursing Practice Plan for Pressure Injury Prevention in Surgical Patients between the two groups. RESULTS: After implementing checklist-based management, compared to the control group, the observation group showed significant improvements: risk assessment compliance rate increased from 83.02% to 95.23%;Patient positioning pass rate increased from 81.25% to 95.25%; proper use rate of pressure-relieving dressings increased from 72.75% to 96.50%; average score for comprehensive knowledge of prevention management increased from 77.69 +/- 4.67 to 92.89 +/- 1.54; incidence of pressure injuries decreased from 0.322% to 0.067%, with the incidence of Stage 2 or higher pressure injuries decreasing from 0.086% to 0.000%. Additionally, the observation group scored significantly higher than the control group in terms of implementation convenience, operational proficiency, and team collaboration efficiency, and it had a long-term positive impact. All indicators showed statistical significance (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Checklist management facilitates the routine implementation of pressure injury prevention management programs for oncologic surgical patients, effectively enhances nurses' preventive practice abilities, thereby reducing the incidence of pressure injuries. It promotes refined and homogeneous development in operating room nursing quality control."
cancer,"This study examined the seasonal variation of trace elements (B, Ba, Cr, Pb, Sb, Se, Zn) in soil and Kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum) around the Darvill Wastewater Treatment Works in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. Twenty sites were sampled during wet and dry seasons and compared with control areas, Pietermaritzburg (PMB), Dumabezwe, and Mqulela sports fields. The samples were analysed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) for trace element concentrations. The results showed that trace element concentrations were significantly elevated near the Darvill Wastewater Treatment Works, especially during the dry season. Cr and Se had the highest soil levels, 1978 mg/kg and 1169 mg/kg, respectively. Only Cr showed substantial concentration in the Kikuyu grass tissue (957 mg/kg). The study evaluated the Kikuyu grass for soil remediation and trace element recovery; Cr (1.3) and Se (1.1) showed minimal bioaccumulation ability. Cr and Pb posed health risks via ingestion (hazard quotient > 1), particularly for children. Cr also showed the highest cancer risk, with total cancer risk values exceeding 1 x 10(-)(4), and Zn posed minimal health risks. Geo accumulation index (I(geo)) values showed high pollution from Cr (I(geo) > 5), and moderate from Pb and Zn. Enrichment factor (EF) values for Cr and Zn (EF > 1.5) indicated anthropogenic sources; Pb (EF < 1.5) suggested a natural origin. Correlation and Pearson correlation analysis linked trace elements to sewage sludge application. The sports fields showed low trace element concentrations, suggesting minimal risk of cross-contamination during grass transfer and reduced trace element content in regrown grass."
cancer,"AIM: To establish a chain mediating model examining family caring, illness acceptance, perceived control, and self-perceived burden, based on the middle-range theory of adaptation to chronic illness, and to empirically test this model. METHODS: From June 2023 and March 2024, 254 elderly breast cancer patients were enrolled. Data were collected using a general information questionnaire, the family APGAR questionnaire, the self-perceived burden scale for breast cancer patients, the acceptance of illness scale, and the cancer experience and efficacy scale. IBM SPSS v26.0 and IBM AMOS v26.0 were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Family caring, illness acceptance, and perceived control demonstrated direct and statistically significant associations with self-perceived burden. Family caring indirectly affected self-perceived burden through five identified pathways. Three served as independent partial mediators in the relationship between family caring and self-perceived burden: illness acceptance (beta = -0.172, [-0.110, -0.042]), perceived control (cancer experience) (beta = -0.115, [-0.183, -0.056]), and perceived control (control efficacy) (beta = -0.136, [-0.182, -0.098]). Two others were serial mediation pathways in the relationship: one through illness acceptance and perceived control (cancer experience) (beta = 0.046, [0.016, 0.088]), and another through illness acceptance and perceived control (control efficacy) (beta = 0.029, [0.013, 0.052]). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: The study confirmed that family caring primarily alleviates self-perceived burden by enhancing illness acceptance and reducing negative cancer-related experiences in elderly breast cancer patients. Thus, the assessment of family caring should be integrated into routine nursing practice, and psychoeducational programs designed to promote illness acceptance and reduce negative cancer-related experiences should be implemented."
cancer,"Over the past decades, neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NAT) has been increasingly adopted in early-stage breast cancer (BC), highlighting the need for a more accurate assessment of treatment response. Imaging tools such as [(18)F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) may enhance diagnostic accuracy in this context. By comprehensively reviewing the available literature, [(18)F]FDG PET/CT generally shows good sensibility but lower specificity for predicting and evaluating pathological complete response (pCR), respectively, during NAT and preoperatively, in both the breast and lymph nodes. Thereby its use may support timely escalation of systemic treatment or surgery in patients with poor metabolic response. However, definitive conclusions are limited by small, heterogeneous studies with variable patient selection, timing, and response definitions. Consequently, while international guidelines remain inconsistent, further evidence is needed to define its role in response assessment, establish the optimal use in clinical practice, and clarify its integration into (de)-escalation strategies."
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate breast cancers missed by artificial intelligence-based computer-aided diagnosis (AI-CAD) in women newly diagnosed with breast cancer, identify factors associated with these missed cases, and assess the potential diagnostic value of standalone diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in detecting cancers overlooked by AI-CAD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 414 women (mean age, 55.3 years) with pathologically confirmed breast cancer who underwent preoperative mammography, MRI with DWI, and surgery. Cancers were classified as AI-detected if the lesion had an abnormality score greater than 10 and was correctly localized by AI-CAD; otherwise, they were categorized as AI-missed. Clinicopathologic and imaging features were compared between groups. Two radiologists independently reviewed DWI of AI-missed cancers and assigned malignancy confidence scores using a 6-point Likert-type scale (>/=3 considered positive). Interobserver agreement and diagnostic performance were analyzed. RESULTS: AI-CAD missed 127 of 414 breast cancers (30.7%). Multivariate regression analysis identified dense breasts (adjusted OR = 1.619; p = 0.049) and tumor size </= 2 cm (adjusted OR = 4.698; p < 0.001) as independent predictors of AI-missed cancer. Standalone DWI detected 83.5% and 79.5% of AI-missed cancers for Radiologists 1 and 2, respectively, with substantial agreement (kappa = 0.61). DWI was effective in detecting mammographically occult or >1 cm tumors, but sensitivity declined for subcentimeter lesions. CONCLUSION: Standalone DWI detects the majority of breast cancers missed by AI-CAD, supporting its potential role as a triage adjunct in AI-based screening, particularly for dense breasts and mammographically occult lesions. However, the retrospective, cancer-only design limits generalizability, highlighting the need for prospective multicenter screening trials for validation."
cancer,"Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy (RARP) is the predominant surgical approach for localized prostate cancer in the United States and over 50% of RARP are performed as ambulatory or same-day discharge encounters. Current literature supports that RARP performed in the outpatient setting are as effective and have no increase in complications compared to those performed inpatient and cost nearly 20% less than those performed inpatient. Between May 2021 and December 2021, two-high volume robotic surgeons at an independent multi-specialty physician group performed RARP in both a freestanding ambulatory surgery center (ASC) and in an affiliated hospital. Data on demographics, clinical and pathological variables, operative metrics, outcomes, and complications were collected. Analysis involved the use of descriptive statistics, t-tests for continuous variables, and Chi-Square analysis and Fisher's tests for categorical variables. 40 ASC cases and 50 hospital cases were identified. There were no significant differences in mean age, BMI, PSA, prostate volume, and final pathological stage between groups. The hospital group had higher grade group classification. There were no significant differences in ASA classification, estimated blood loss, operative time, or complications between groups. The hospital group had higher recovery time and length of stay. There were no readmissions in either group. RARP performed in an ASC demonstrated outcomes comparable to those performed in a hospital. These findings are consistent with published evidence that outpatient RARP are safe and cost-effective, supporting reconsideration of current CMS reimbursement policies that restrict access to ambulatory surgical care for prostate cancer."
cancer,"Tumor-associated extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling provides a supportive microenvironment for aberrant cellular behaviors and fate, resulting in tumor progression. Concurrently, reprogrammed lipid metabolism, characterized by dysregulated de novo lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and lipid peroxidation, serves as a metabolic hallmark of cancer. Emerging evidence reveals a bidirectional crosstalk between ECM remodeling and lipid metabolic rewiring, which collectively drive tumorigenesis, survival, metastasis, and drug resistance. However, the mechanistic links connecting ECM dynamics to cellular lipid metabolism remain incompletely elucidated. In this review, we dissect the mechanistic underpinnings of ECM-lipid metabolism crosstalk, focusing on biochemical and biophysical modulation. In general, ECM-lipid metabolism axis form a self-amplifying feedback circuit, wherein ECM remodeling regulates lipid anabolism and catabolism to fuel energy production, membrane biosynthesis, and signaling molecules generation, while lipid metabolites reciprocally promote ECM degradation or deposition. Targeting critical nodes within this circuit-such as ECM-derived cues (e.g., collagen) or intracellular lipid metabolism pathway (e.g., FAO)-represents a promising strategy to disrupt tumor-stroma coevolution and enhance therapeutic efficacy. Notably, this crosstalk is not static but highly dynamic, exhibiting context-dependent dual roles influenced by variables such as cell state, cancer type, tumor site, and disease stage."

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Tramadol has been used for cancer pain and reported in the literature with varying relative effects compared to other analgesics. To our knowledge, there is no comprehensive systematic review documenting the efficacy/effectiveness and safety of tramadol for cancer-associated pain. The aim of this review is to report on the efficacy/effectiveness and safety of tramadol for cancer-associated pain. METHODS: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched through September 29, 2023. Articles were included if they reported on tramadol in a multi-arm comparative trial, employing either a randomized controlled trial design or an observational study design with a multivariable or propensity-score matched analysis, and reported on efficacy or safety data pertaining to tramadol. A narrative synthesis was conducted to identify common themes across trials of efficacy and safety endpoints. RESULTS: Eleven studies with 2582 patients were included. Two were cohort studies and nine were randomized controlled trials. There were 20 efficacy endpoints; tramadol was superior in 3, inferior in 4, and neither in 13. There were 80 safety endpoints; tramadol was superior in 9, inferior in 12, and neither in 59. DISCUSSION: Relative to other analgesics, tramadol is neither superior nor inferior. There may exist a different safety profile and therefore an opportunity to provide individualized patient-centered treatment strategies focused on safety and quality of life."
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic value of three-dimensional superb micro-vascular imaging (3D-SMI) combined with quantitative analysis of Area and VI in differentiating benign and malignant renal tumors. METHODS: A total of 256 renal lesions from 254 patients who underwent gray-scale ultrasound (Gray US), two-dimensional superb micro-vascular imaging (2D-SMI), and 3D-SMI examinations at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital between January 2022 and June 2024 were retrospectively analyzed. The imaging features on Gray US, 2D-SMI and 3D-SMI were recorded. Based on 3D-SMI, Vascular Architecture were classified into five types: Type I (avascular), Type II (spotty flow), Type III (sparse flow), Type IV (encircling), and Type V (rich flow). The plane with the most abundant blood flow was selected, and the Area and VI were calculated using Image Pro Plus (IPP) software. Histopathology from surgery or biopsy served as the reference standard. The differences in Vascular Architecture, Area, and VI between benign and malignant renal tumors were compared, and their diagnostic performance was evaluated. RESULTS: Among the 256 lesions, 70 were benign and 186 were malignant. The interobserver agreement for Vascular Architecture classification was good (Kappa = 0.803), and the consistency for Area and VI was high (ICC = 0.835 and 0.864, respectively). Benign tumors Vascular Architecture were mainly type II or III, with mean Area and VI values of 945.87 +/- 568.26 (range: 68-3125) and 5.93 +/- 4.95 (range: 0.23-24.73), respectively. Malignant tumors were predominantly type IV or V, with mean Area and VI values of 3694.53 +/- 2612.38 (range: 93-9965) and 18.21 +/- 10.83 (range: 0.69-48.13), respectively. Significant differences were observed in Vascular Architecture, Area, and VI between benign and malignant lesions (all P < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) values for 3D-SMI Vascular Architecture, Area, VI, 2D-SMI, and Gray US were 0.813, 0.807, 0.859, 0.750, and 0.718, respectively. VI demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance, with a cutoff value of 8.19 (sensitivity: 82.26%; specificity: 85.51%). Among benign subtypes, there were no significant differences in Vascular Architecture or Area (P > 0.05), while the VI of oncocytoma was significantly higher than epithelioid angiomyolipoma (EMAL), metanephric adenomas (MA), and angiomyolipoma (AML)(P < 0.01). Among malignant subtypes, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) showed distinct Vascular Architecture compared with papillary renal cell carcinoma(pRCC), chromophobe renal cell carcinoma(chRCC), and Xp11.2 translocation/TFE3 fusion-associated renal cell carcinoma(tRCC) (P < 0.01). The Area and VI of ccRCC were significantly higher than those of pRCC and chRCC (P < 0.05), but not significantly different from tRCC (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: 3D-SMI provides three-dimensional visualization of Vascular Architecture. Quantitative analysis of the most vascularized plane using Area and VI differentiation between benign and malignant renal tumors, with VI demonstrating the best diagnostic efficacy. This technique offers a non-invasive diagnostic approach for renal tumors."
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer is now the most commonly diagnosed endocrine malignancy over the past decade, with its incidence having risen sharply. Due to its asymptomatic presentation and poor prognosis when detected at advanced stages, early diagnosis of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) remains a challenge, even with recent medical advancements. Fortunately, serum-based miRNA testing offers a safe, minimally invasive, and repeatable diagnostic tool. Among promising miRNAs, miRNA-155 has emerged as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis and, miRNA-429 appears to be more variable and cancer-type specific. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the expression levels of miRNA-155 and miRNA-429 and to evaluate their correlation with patient prognosis in thyroid cancer. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study cohort comprised 37 patients with benign thyroid tumors, 37 patients with thyroid cancer, and 74 healthy, age- and sex-matched controls. Plasma samples were collected from all participants, and the expression levels of miRNA-155 and miRNA-429 were quantified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: miR-155 expression was significantly upregulated in both benign and malignant thyroid tumors compared to controls (p < 0.001), whereas miR-429 expression was markedly downregulated in both tumor groups relative to controls (p < 0.001). Additionally, miR-155 expression shows weak positive correlation with lymph node involvement in patients with thyroid cancer. CONCLUSION: miR-155 appears to be a promising minimally invasive biomarker for thyroid malignancy, while miR-429 cannot reliably distinguish malignant from non-malignant lesions; further studies are needed to validate these findings."
cardio,"PurposeTo investigate the association between PREVENT, a cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk estimation model, and quantitative parameters derived from choroidal vascular imaging.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study including 82 eyes from 82 patients aged 30 to 79 years who attended a standard ophthalmologic evaluation. Choroidal vascularity index (CVI), total choroidal area (TCA), luminal choroidal area (LCA), stromal choroidal area (SCA), and vessel density (VD) in the choriocapillaris (CC) and mid choroid, measured using swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA), were recorded.ResultsTCA, LCA, and SCA were significantly lower in the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group (p value <0.001). Correlation analysis revealed a significant negative association between 10-year PREVENT scores and TCA, LCA, and SCA (r  approximately -0.350, p value <0.001), and between the 30-year PREVENT score and VD in the CC (r = -0.370, p value = 0.037).ConclusionThis study provides initial evidence that choroidal structural and vascular parameters are inversely associated with long-term cardiovascular risk, suggesting their potential utility in the primary prevention of CVD. Further longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm these findings."
cardio,"The inter-disciplinary relationship between the gut microbiota, mitochondrial function, and inflammation activation represents a frontier in understanding Cardiovascular complications. This comprehensive review provides a framework of the signalling networks that link these three biological systems and their collective impact on cardiovascular disease. The gut microbiota is a diverse ecological community comprising bacterial phyla, including Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, which contribute to the functions of distal organs by producing bioactive metabolites. We systematically examined how microbial dysbiosis participates in inflammasome and mitochondrial-derived cardiovascular pathophysiology. This review also provides insight into various molecular pathways (TLR, PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, MAPK, TRPV, CREB, TXNIP, YAP, MyD88 and NLRP3) and therapeutic interventions targeting this axis, including gut microbiota modulation agents, mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants, and inflammasome inhibitors, offering mechanistic insights into their cardioprotective effects. Using current evidence and data from PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and ResearchGate, we provide a mechanistic understanding of the gut microbiota-mitochondria-inflammasome axis. This triad represents a critical target in cardiovascular health and warrants new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."
cardio,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hypertension is the leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Despite multiple antihypertensive therapies, blood pressure (BP) control remains suboptimal in many individuals with persistent cardiovascular risk. This review evaluates the antihypertensive potential of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), particularly in patients with comorbid diabetes, HF, CKD or resistant hypertension. RECENT FINDINGS: SGLT2-i consistently lower office SBP/DBP (2.5-4.0/1.5-2.0 mmHg) and 24-hour ambulatory BP (3.8/1.8 mmHg). GLP-1RAs show modest SBP reductions (1.8-5.1 mmHg) and minimal DBP effects (~ 0.5 mmHg), though tirzepatide shows greater efficacy (~ 10.6 mmHg) in select populations. Both classes have demonstrated cardio-renal benefits, favorable safety profiles, and reduced polypharmacy. SGLT2-i exert more consistent BP-lowering effects than GLP-1RA, largely due to their diuretic-like action. While not first-line therapies, both drug classes show promise as adjuncts in high-risk populations. Future research should further define their role in comprehensive hypertension management."
cardio,"PURPOSE: To reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events in patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD), guidelines recommend adopting a more plant-based diet. The EAT-Lancet diet, which focuses on plant-based foods, is associated with a lower risk of CVD in apparently healthy people. However, the relationship in patients with established CVD is unclear. Therefore, the aim of this research was to quantify the relationship between the EAT-Lancet Healthy Reference Diet (HRD) and risk of recurrent CVD in patients with established CVD. METHODS: Patients with established CVD from the Utrecht Cardiovascular Cohort-Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease were studied. Dietary intake was measured using a food frequency questionnaire and the relationship between the EAT-Lancet HRD (score from 0 to 140 points) and non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke was assessed using Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, educational background, lifestyle factors, and energy intake. RESULTS: During a follow-up of 24,212 person-years 209 non-fatal vascular events occurred. The median score for the EAT-Lancet HRD was 57 out of 140 points (IQR: 41-68). After adjustment for confounders, a diet more in line with the EAT-Lancet HRD was associated with a lower risk of non-fatal vascular events (HR 0.87 (95% CI 0.79-0.96) per 10-point increase); stroke (HR 0.76 (95% CI 0.63-0.91) per 10-point increase); and a trend towards lower risk of myocardial infarction (HR 0.90 (95% CI 0.81-1.02) per 10-point increase). CONCLUSION: In patients with established CVD, a dietary pattern more in line with the EAT-Lancet HRD is associated with a lower risk of non-fatal stroke and myocardial infarction."
cardio,"Masters athletes (MAs), defined as individuals >/=35 years of age who are engaged in competitive or high-volume recreational sports or exercise training, comprise a growing group regularly cared for in sports cardiology. The cardiovascular care of MAs can be challenging because many of the classical tenets in sports cardiology and exercise physiology were derived from young, competitive athletes and therefore do not fully generalize to the care of MAs. Appropriate implementation of multimodality cardiovascular imaging is essential to guide the risk stratification and clinical management of MAs. In this state-of-the-art review, physiological and pathologic considerations unique to MAs are highlighted. The strengths and limitations of specific cardiovascular imaging modalities are reviewed along with guidance on their appropriate use in the care of MAs. The purpose of this document is to represent the first primary reference on best practice considerations for the use of multimodality cardiovascular imaging in the care of MAs."
cardio,"BACKGROUND: The effects of statin therapy on pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) and its relationship with plaque progression and outcomes in people with HIV (PWH) remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate PCAT density changes over time; statin effects on PCAT; and associations among PCAT changes, coronary plaque, and clinical outcomes. METHODS: In the REPRIEVE (Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV) mechanistic computed tomographic (CT) substudy (n = 753, mean age 51 +/- 6 years, 17% women), PCAT density was measured from noncontrast CT images at baseline and 2 years, while coronary plaque volumes (total, calcified, and noncalcified) were assessed from contrast-enhanced CT angiograms. Analyses were stratified by coronary artery disease burden (segment involvement score 0, 1-3, or >/=4) and adjusted for technical parameters, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, body mass index, inflammatory biomarkers, and statin allocation. Associations among PCAT, plaque changes, and events (all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE], and MACE or death) were evaluated. RESULTS: Baseline PCAT density was -87.7 +/- 10.5 HU, increasing by 4.5 HU (95% CI: 3.8-5.2; P < 0.001) over 2 years. Pitavastatin prevented this increase in participants with segment involvement scores >/=4 (-1.7 HU vs +3.8 HU; P = 0.016, pitavastatin vs placebo, respectively). Greater PCAT density was associated with higher noncalcified plaque volume (per +10 HU, +5.0 mm(3); P = 0.075) and reduced calcified plaque progression (-3.2 mm(3); P = 0.031). Over a median of 6.3 years, 4.2% of patients died. Baseline PCAT density was independently associated with all-cause mortality (HR per +10 HU: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.03-3.69; P = 0.040), but not MACE. CONCLUSIONS: PCAT density increases over time in PWH, but pitavastatin mitigates this in those with high coronary artery disease burden. PCAT density is associated with vulnerable plaque morphology and all-cause mortality, supporting its potential as a prognostic imaging biomarker in PWH.

cardio,"The causal effect of lower plasma sclerostin on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has previously been examined with the aim of investigating potential side effects of pharmacological sclerostin inhibition for treatment of osteoporosis. We explored the relationship between plasma sclerostin levels and CVDs and bone phenotypes using Mendelian randomization (MR) and correlation between plasma sclerostin levels and these outcomes. We used variants identified in genome-wide association studies of plasma sclerostin levels in large proteomic datasets from the UK Biobank (Olink) and Iceland (SomaScan) as instruments in two separate MR analyses. These analyses did not provide evidence of association between the effects of sequence variants on plasma sclerostin levels and their effects on CVDs and CVD risk factors (P > 0.05). Several of the instruments had heterogenic effects on bone phenotypes and causal estimates in MR were non-significant (P > 0.05/8). Plasma sclerostin levels correlated positively with coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction and CVD risk factors. Our results do not provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that lower plasma sclerostin levels increase CVD risk and suggest that plasma sclerostin levels are not a good surrogate for pharmacological inhibition."
cardio,"BACKGROUND: Information is lacking regarding the association between basic characteristics and outcome following surgically treated ankle fractures. This study aims to investigate basic characteristics and comorbidity of surgically treated ankle fracture patients and their influence on long-term Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) subscale scores. The secondary aim was to compare long-term FAOS subscale scores to national FAOS reference values. METHODS: The study design was a retrospective cohort study. Adult patients with a surgically treated ankle fracture between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2018, were included. Basic characteristics such as age, gender, comorbidity, and fracture classification were obtained. Patient-reported outcome was derived using the FAOS in March 2023. RESULTS: Included were 278 patients available for analysis of basic characteristics and comorbidity. The mean age was 54.2 years (range = 18-96), and 59% were female. A total of 202 patients (73%) had a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of 0 and the mean CCI was 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.54-0.90). Cardiovascular disease (17.6%) was the most frequent comorbidity, followed by diabetes (6.4%). A total of 122 of 242 patients (50%) completed the FAOS questionnaire. Age and gender were observed with non-significant associations to FAOS subscale scores. Body mass index (BMI) was observed with significant signification for the subscale activities of daily living (ADL), Sport/Rec, and quality of life (QOL) (P < .04). No significant difference between patients with and without comorbidity was observed in FAOS subscale scores, due to non-overlapping 95% CIs. CONCLUSION: This 2-year consecutive sample of surgically treated ankle fractures revealed a low degree of comorbidity with more than 73% of patients observed with a CCI of 0. In contrast to BMI, baseline characteristics such as age and gender showed no significant association to the long-term FAOS. The FAOS subscale scores showed worse outcomes compared to representative reference values, indicating considerable patient-perceived complaints even years after fracture. Further research is needed to investigate the influence of comorbidity and fracture subgroups on long-term patient-reported outcome. LEVELS OF EVIDENCE: III."
cardio,"The heart team (HT) is a multidisciplinary team that performs a comprehensive review of patients with complex cardiac issues, collaborates on potential treatment options, and provides the patient with treatment recommendations. Despite strong guideline support and HT's ubiquitous presence, data on how to operationally design, implement, and measure the success of an HT remain limited. This, in turn, has led to wide variability in how HT are instituted. This review examines the development and strategy toward operationalizing HT to help identify potential barriers to HT development and growth. The HT itself is the culmination of a complex care process with the goal of adopting an integrated, patient-centric HT approach to treatment decisions in the care of patients with complex coronary artery disease."
cardio,"BACKGROUND: Hemodialysis (HD) patients are at high risk of vascular calcification (VC) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The coexistence of sarcopenia and malnutrition, known as malnutrition-sarcopenia syndrome (MSS), may further exacerbate these risks. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of MSS in HD patients and its association with abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). METHODS: This prospective cohort study enrolled 462 maintenance HD patients, who were subsequently stratified into four groups: no sarcopenia-no malnutrition, sarcopenia alone, malnutrition alone, and MSS. Sarcopenia was diagnosed based on the 2019 Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) criteria, and malnutrition was assessed using the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI). AAC was evaluated using lateral abdominal radiographs and scored according to Kauppila's semiquantitative scoring system. The primary outcome was MACE during a 3-year follow-up period. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analyses were employed to determine associations and potential mechanisms. RESULTS: The prevalence of sarcopenia and malnutrition was 46.3 and 32.0%, respectively, with 18.2% of patients having MSS. MSS was independently associated with increased AAC (OR: 2.157, 95% CI: 1.064-4.373, p = 0.033) and MACE risk (OR: 2.235, 95% CI: 1.192-4.194, p = 0.012). Mediation analysis revealed that AAC severity partially mediated the relationship between MSS and MACE, accounting for 26.7% of the total effect. CONCLUSION: MSS is prevalent in HD patients and is associated with more severe VC and higher cardiovascular risk. Comprehensive nutritional assessment and targeted interventions are needed to address sarcopenia and malnutrition in HD patients to improve their cardiovascular outcomes."
cardio,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common type of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and poses a heavy economic burden worldwide due to its persistently high incidence and mortality rates. In recent years, the pathogenesis of CHD is well-understood, and the ""gut-heart axis"" theory reveals that the gut microbiota mediated dietary components enter the cardiovascular system via mechanisms including immune metabolism, epigenetics (regulation), and microbial metabolism, which can promote the formation and development of atherosclerosis. This theory identifies the gut microbiota as a promising therapeutic target for CHD intervention. The gut microbiota is highly plastic and closely related to dietary habits. Appropriate nutritional management can achieve the purpose of preventing and treating CHD. From the perspective of the ""gut-heart axis,"" this review integrates previous research results and current research progress on the gut microbiota in CHD, summarizes the gut microbiota and related pathogenesis in CHD patients, discusses the interrelationship between CHD, nutritional management, and gut microbiota, and explores the existing problems and recent advances in nutritional management of CHD patients, which provides reference ideas for possible therapeutic strategies and precision nutrition support in CHD."
cardio,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that causes deficits in social interactions, communication skills, intellectual limitations, and self-injurious behaviors. Common systemic comorbidities include gastrointestinal issues, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Recent study has found a link between gut microbiota alterations and neurobehavioral symptoms in children with ASD. Physical activity and exercise therapy have been demonstrated to promote communication and social interaction while also positively influencing microbiota composition. This research intends to highlight how various sports can improve speech and social abilities in autistic children while also benefitting gut microbiota composition. Parents of autistic children confront several problems. Many parents are too busy or lack the essential information to care for their children at home, so they rely on government-provided healthcare facilities. This condition hinders these youngsters from having a regular upbringing, resulting in behaviors more akin to younger children as they get older. They frequently suffer from mental health concerns and may fail to articulate their needs and desires effectively. The inability to articulate oneself can lead to negative conduct, especially against others who remind them of their parents or siblings. Addressing these issues may entail examining early memories and involving people in activities that match their interests and developmental phases. By doing so, they may feel more understood and sensitive to instruction, like a small child."
cardio,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic pain is a major global health problem that significantly affects quality of life and increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: Using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 data, this study analyzed temporal trends in chronic pain across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We further examined the influence of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), explored age- and sex-specific patterns, and projected the future burden of chronic pain through 2032. Cardiovascular diseases data were also analyzed for correlations with chronic pain. RESULTS: Results showed a significant positive association between SDI and age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR), with higher burdens in more developed regions, especially for cancer- and arthritis-related pain. Apart from headaches, most types of chronic pain-including low back pain, neck pain, osteoarthritis-related pain, and rheumatoid arthritis-related pain-were more prevalent in older adults. Females were generally more affected by musculoskeletal and arthritis-related pain, while males showed higher rates of gout- and pancreatitis-related pain. Projections suggest that the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis and other musculoskeletal pain will continue to rise, whereas gout-, back-, neck-, and pancreatitis-related pain are expected to decline. Notably, chronic pain showed significant positive correlations with several cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic heart disease and stroke. DISCUSSION: The global burden of chronic pain remains substantial and unevenly distributed by sex, age, and SDI level. The observed association between chronic pain and cardiovascular diseases highlights the need for integrated management strategies targeting both conditions."
cardio,"OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis evaluated the association of frailty and pre-frailty with cardiovascular mortality in cohort studies. While frailty is a recognized predictor of poor outcomes, the prognostic role of pre-frailty-a critical intermediate stage-remains less clear. We assessed their associations with cardiovascular mortality, explored heterogeneity, and examined the robustness of findings through publication bias analyses. METHODS: Cohort studies published up to 2025 were systematically searched. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using random-effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I (2) statistic. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were performed to explore sources of heterogeneity, but no single factor fully explained the high variability observed (I (2) > 80%). Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and statistical tests, with no significant bias detected. RESULTS: Twenty-six cohort studies involving over 4 million participants were included. Frailty was significantly associated with higher cardiovascular mortality (HR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.86-2.40), and pre-frailty also conferred elevated risk (HR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.46-2.23). Despite substantial heterogeneity (I (2) > 80%), subgroup analyses and meta-regression did not identify a clear source. No publication bias was found. CONCLUSION: Frailty and pre-frailty are consistently associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, emphasizing their value for early risk identification and preventive strategies. Given the observational nature and residual heterogeneity, findings should be interpreted cautiously, and future research is needed to establish standardized assessment tools and test targeted interventions.

cardio,"INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide, underscoring the importance of accessible health communication. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT and MediSearch have potential to bridge knowledge gaps, but their effectiveness depends on both accuracy and readability. This study evaluated how natural language processing (NLP) models respond to CVD-related questions across different education levels. METHODS: Thirty-five frequently asked questions from reputable sources were reformatted into prompts representing lower secondary, higher secondary, and college graduate levels, and entered into ChatGPT Free (GPT-4o mini), ChatGPT Premium (GPT-4o), and MediSearch (v1.1.4). Readability was assessed using Flesch-Kincaid Ease and Grade Level scores, and response similarity was evaluated with BERT-based cosine similarity. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and Pearson correlation. RESULTS: Readability decreased significantly with increasing education level across all models (p < 0.001). ChatGPT Free responses were more readable than MediSearch (p < 0.001), while ChatGPT Free and Premium demonstrated higher similarity to each other than to MediSearch. ChatGPT Premium explained the greatest variance in readability (r = 0.350; p < 0.001), suggesting stronger adaptability to user education levels compared to ChatGPT Free (r = 0.530; p < 0.001) and MediSearch (r = 0.227; p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: These findings indicate that while NLP models adjust readability by education level, output complexity often exceeds average literacy, highlighting the need for refinement to optimize AI-driven patient education."
cardio,"Utilizing China's air quality monitoring data from 2013 to 2023, this study employs spatial autocorrelation analysis and health impact assessment methodologies to quantify the health economic costs and temporal trends of PM(2.5) and O(3) pollution across mainland China. Results indicate a substantial decline in PM(2.5)-attributable mortality over the study period. With 0 and 15 mug/m(3) taken as the reference concentrations, all-cause mortality decreased by 47.41% (233,173 cases) and 65.55% (240,448 cases), respectively. Cardiovascular disease mortality declined by 47.71% (56,086 cases) and 65.75% (57,504 cases), while respiratory disease mortality reduced by 46.97% (38,519 cases) and 65.27% (40,055 cases). Conversely, O(3)-related mortality exhibited a significant upward trend. At reference concentrations of 0 and 60 mug/m(3), all-cause mortality increased by 24.25% (365,084 cases) and 79.70% (372,724 cases), respectively. Cardiovascular mortality rose by 25.43% (80,056 cases) and 81.52% (77,497 cases), and respiratory mortality increased by 15.46% (98,620 cases) and 64.54% (163,165 cases). Spatially, health economic costs and their GDP proportions for both pollutants followed a high distribution in the east and a low distribution in the west. Shandong, Henan and Jiangsu were the top regions for PM(2.5)-related economic costs, with Henan, Hebei and Tianjin exhibiting the highest GDP ratios. For O(3), Guangdong, Jiangsu and Shandong incurred the greatest economic costs, while Henan, Hebei and Gansu showed the highest GDP proportions. These findings underscore the divergent trends in PM(2.5) and O(3) health impacts and provide critical evidence for targeted air pollution control strategies in China."
cardio,"Cardiovascular conditions disrupt the normal functioning of the heart and blood vessels, often due to underlying conditions like atherosclerosis or hypertension. Antihypertensive medications are essential in cardiovascular disease management, encompassing several major drug classes with distinct mechanisms of action. Hence, this review evaluated the impact of various antihypertensive treatments on cardiovascular event reduction in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (CAS) patients. A comprehensive literature search was conducted from inception to 2024 on various databases by using specific keywords, and based on the eligibility criteria, three observational cohort studies and six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the 540 records retrieved were incorporated in this systematic review. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the methodological quality of the cohort studies, and the risk of bias visualization tool was used for RCTs. Data were then systematically extracted and analyzed. The results reported that enalapril and fosinopril demonstrated dual benefits in blood pressure (BP) reduction and vascular remodeling, though meta-analysis showed statistically insignificant improvements in regional cerebral blood flow (CI: -0.84, 6.08, P = 0.14, I(2)= 94%). Similarly, isradipine, lacidipine, and amlodipine improved carotid hemodynamics and cerebral perfusion, with meta-analysis favoring calcium channel blocker intervention for blood pressure management (CI: -3.25 to 7.64, P = 0.43). On the other hand, thiazide diuretics effectively reduced BP but showed limited efficacy in preventing atherosclerosis progression. In addition, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) significantly reduced 5-year stroke rates from 11% to 3.5%. Moreover, beta-blockers showed specific benefits, with metoprolol improving plaque echogenicity (57.3 +/- 16.8 vs. 51.8 +/- 20.0, p = 0.006) and reducing cardiovascular events (17% vs. 37% placebo, p = 0.011), while labetalol effectively managed post-endarterectomy hypertension. In conclusion, antihypertensive treatments showed varying effectiveness in cardiovascular event reduction and improvements in vessel measures."
cardio,"Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is increasingly identified as a significant cause of acute coronary syndrome and is often associated with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), a non-atherosclerotic, non-inflammatory vascular disease affecting medium-sized arteries. SCAD and FMD frequently co-occur, warranting extracoronary vascular imaging. Horseshoe kidney, a rare congenital anomaly, has been linked to various genitourinary and vascular abnormalities but has not previously been associated with FMD. A man in his early 50s presented with acute chest pain and was diagnosed with SCAD of the obtuse marginal artery. Due to the known association between SCAD and FMD, CT angiography was performed, revealing a horseshoe kidney and a classic string-of-beads appearance in both renal arteries, consistent with multifocal FMD. No abnormalities were found in other vascular beds, and there was no clinical evidence of connective tissue disorders. Renal function was normal, and hypertension was well controlled with antihypertensive medication. The patient was managed conservatively and remains under outpatient follow-up. This is the first reported case of coexisting renal artery multifocal FMD and a horseshoe kidney. While the co-occurrence may initially appear coincidental, the rarity of both conditions suggests a potential, previously unrecognized congenital or biomechanical association. One could hypothesize that the abnormal positioning and limited mobility of the fused kidneys in a horseshoe kidney might contribute to chronic vascular wall stress and arterial remodeling. Further research is warranted to assess the prevalence of FMD in patients with horseshoe kidneys and to explore possible shared developmental or mechanical mechanisms."
cardio,"Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) plays a vital role in the management of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), such as ischemic heart disease and heart failure, which remain major causes of illness and death worldwide. This literature review explores recent progress and future directions in CR, highlighting its importance as a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach. Modern programs now combine exercise training, nutritional guidance, psychosocial support, and lifestyle modification to improve recovery and prevent further cardiac events. The inclusion of technology, such as mobile health apps, wearable monitors, and virtual rehabilitation programs, has made CR more accessible and effective for diverse patient groups. Despite strong evidence showing that CR reduces mortality, improves functional capacity, and enhances quality of life, participation rates remain low. Barriers often include limited availability of programs, low referral rates, and challenges linked to socioeconomic and cultural factors. Addressing these issues requires practical strategies to improve awareness, accessibility, and patient adherence. Future research should focus on developing culturally adaptable and technology-driven models of CR that reach more patients and deliver long-term health benefits."
cardio,"BACKGROUND: Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is characterized by elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and normal free thyroxine (FT4) levels. It may also assume the status of comorbidity with obesity and may cause augmented dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease. The aim of the current study was to estimate the prevalence of SCH and its association with the metabolic aberrations in obese adults. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, the random sampling method was used to recruit 200 obese adults (body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m(2) and above) who were tested during six months in Shaikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan. The clinical and demographic data of the anthropometric measurements were also recorded. The laboratory tests were interpreted to identify serum TSH, FT4, fasting blood glucose, lipid profile, and insulin resistance calculated through the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). SCH featured TSH.4.5 mIU/L with normal FT4. The data were analyzed by using the chi-square test, independent t-tests, and Pearson with p < 0.05. RESULTS: SCH was present in 41.0% (82/200) of obese adults. SCH patients had significantly greater BMI, fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, total cholesterol, and LDL-C (all p < 0.05) but lower levels of HDL-C (p = 0.004). TSH showed positive correlations with BMI (r = 0.32), HOMA-IR (r = 0.41), and lipid abnormalities and a negative correlation with HDL-C (r = -0.22, p = 0.046). CONCLUSION: SCH was seen to be more common in obese adults and was strongly associated with poor metabolic phenotypes. Thyroid screening within the early years of obese patients would facilitate an appropriate early diagnosis and treatment process to mitigate cardiometabolic risk."
cardio,"Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an uncommon cause of acute myocardial infarction, typically affecting younger individuals without traditional risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The underlying pathophysiology differs entirely from that of atherosclerotic myocardial infarction, necessitating distinct diagnostic and management strategies. When SCAD occurs during pregnancy, it is termed pregnancy-associated SCAD (P-SCAD). Because of its rarity, no standardized guidelines currently exist for the diagnosis and management of P-SCAD. We report the case of a 37-year-old woman at 35 weeks' gestation, with no traditional atherosclerotic risk factors, who presented with chest pain. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed subtle changes suggestive of anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Considering the procedural risks associated with an invasive coronary angiogram, a computed tomography (CT) coronary angiogram was performed first, confirming dissection involving the left main stem and proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. She experienced a brief episode of pulmonary edema that responded well to furosemide and subsequently remained hemodynamically stable. The patient was monitored in the hospital and later delivered uneventfully about four weeks after the event. This case highlights the value of CT coronary angiogram as a non-invasive diagnostic option in hemodynamically stable antepartum patients with suspected SCAD, providing a safe alternative to invasive angiography in selected cases."
cardio,"OBJECTIVE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, and early prediction and prevention are essential to reduce its incidence. In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have made significant progress in medical imaging analysis, especially in predicting CVD risk from retinal imaging. METHODS: As of August 2025, we searched using several electronic databases including PubMed, Web Of Science Core Collection. Screening was performed based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 43 papers were finally selected. RESULTS: AI shows great potential in predicting CVD risk from retinal imaging [optical coherence tomography (OCT), optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and color fundus photography (CFP)]. Non-invasive eye examinations combined with AI analysis offer the potential for mass screening and early warning. CONCLUSIONS: AI has made significant progress in the field of CVD assisted diagnosis and risk assessment using retinal imaging. Single-modality models have achieved high accuracy, while multimodal models have further enhanced performance. However, challenges remain, including reliance on single-center data and insufficient generalization capabilities. Future steps include building multi-center datasets, developing dynamic risk models, and promoting portable devices for underserved regions. While promising for early CVD prevention, interdisciplinary collaboration is needed to improve generalizability, standardization, and interpretability for higher clinical value."
cardio,"OBJECTIVE: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the leading cause of global mortality, demand novel strategies to enhance cardiac regeneration. While ongoing research has begun to address the critical need for novel therapies aimed at regenerating cardiomyocytes in the context of cardiovascular disease, existing pharmacological interventions remain insufficient. This study was designed to systematically evaluate natural extracts for their potential to enhance cardiomyocyte differentiation and facilitate cardiac repair. METHODS: We performed an extensive literature review and identified 22 natural extracts associated with cardiac regeneration and stem cell differentiation. Through the use of a Tnnt2H2B-mCherry reporter mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) line, we determined that Ganoderma lucidum water extract (GLW) are potent inducers of cardiomyocyte differentiation both in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: GLW extracts significantly increased the proportion of beating cardiomyocytes, upregulated cardiac-specific markers (e.g., Tnnt2, Myh6), and enhanced the expression of key transcription factors (Isl1, Nkx2.5, Gata4, Mef2c) during cardiac progenitor cell (CPC) specification. Mechanistically, GLW modulated the Wnt signaling pathway, which is critical for CPCs specification. in vivo research experiments have shown that GLW can treat mice with myocardial infarction (MI) and improve cardiac function,as evidenced by increased ejection fraction and fractional shortening, along with enhanced proliferation of cardiomyocytes. Notably, GLW, particularly at higher doses, and promoted structural maturation of cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the potential of GLW as promising candidates for dual-functional therapies targeting myocardial regeneration and injury mitigation, providing novel insights into natural product-based interventions for CVD management."
cardio,"BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index is a recognized marker of insulin resistance, yet its role in the dynamic progression from cardiovascular disease (CVD) to cardiovascular multimorbidity (CVM) remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the TyG index and transitions from a CVD-free state to first CVD and subsequently to CVM. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we included participants from the Shanghai Suburban Adult Cohort who were free of CVD at baseline (2016). The TyG index was measured at baseline. Disease transitions were tracked over a median follow-up of 6.26 years. First CVD event was defined as the initial occurrence of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, or heart failure (HF), and CVM was defined as the presence of two or more of these conditions. Multi-state models were used to assess the association between the TyG index and transitions across health states, including disease-specific pathways. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 6.26 years, 1,182 (3.79%) participants developed first CVD event, 671 (2.15%) developed CVM. TyG index played crucial but different roles in all transitions from healthy to first CVD event, to CVM (HR = 1.162, 95% CI: 1.074, 1.257; HR = 1.148, 95% CI: 1.010, 1.305). When we further divided first CVD events into CHD, Stroke, and HF, we found that TyG index played different roles in disease-speci fi c transitions even within the same transition stage (HR = 1.145, 95% CI: 1.029, 1.273; HR = 1.228, 95% CI: 1.085, 1.391; HR = 1.213, 95% CI: 1.057, 1.391). CONCLUSIONS: The TyG index is an independent predictor of dynamic progression toward cardiovascular multimorbidity, showing significant associations with atherosclerosis-driven conditions such as CHD and stroke but not with heart failure. These findings support its potential utility in risk stratification and preventive strategies across the cardiovascular disease continuum."
cardio,"PURPOSE: SCORE2 is a 10-year CVD risk prediction model developed for use in European populations. This study aimed to externally validate the SCORE2 model and assess its clinical usefulness in an Iranian adult population using data from the TLGS cohort. METHODS: A total of 4,942 individuals aged 40-69 years participated in the TLGS cohort, which was randomly sampled from the population. A Fine and Gray competing risk model was fitted to estimate sex-specific regression coefficients in the TLGS cohort for comparison with the original SCORE2 model. The outcome was first fatal or non-fatal CVD event (myocardial infarction, stroke, or CVD death), considering non-CVD mortality as a competing event. The predictors included age, sex, smoking status, history of diabetes, SBP, total cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol. Model performance was evaluated as statistical performance (discrimination using Harrell's C-index , calibration via plots and O/E ratio) and clinical performance (sensitivity, specificity, decision curve analysis, and net benefit fraction) across different SCORE2 risk thresholds. RESULTS: A total of 4,579 adults without a history of CVD were included in this study. During the follow-up period, CVD events occurred in 211 (11.05%) men and 151 (5.70%) women. The 10-year cumulative incidence of CVD was 8.00% (95% CI: 6.90-9.40) in men and 3.70% (3.00-4.50) in women. The validated SCORE2 model showed higher discrimination in women (C-index: 0.80; 0.76-0.83) than in men (0.70; 0.67-0.74), but it underestimated the CVD risk in both sexes (men: O/E: 2.05; 2.02-2.08, women: O/E: 1.50; 1.40-1.50). At the risk threshold of </= 2.5% for individuals under 50 years and </= 5% for those aged 50 years and older, sensitivity in men was 0.65 (0.57-0.73) and specificity was 0.63 (0.60-0.65). In women, sensitivity was 0.54 (0.44-0.64) and specificity was 0.88 (0.87-0.89). Decision curve analysis supported its clinical usefulness, particularly at intermediate risk levels (7.5-15%) in both sexes. The net benefit fraction ranged from 0.13 to 0.49 in men and 0.07-0.42 in women. CONCLUSION: The validated SCORE2 model demonstrated good discriminatory performance, particularly in women, but calibration tended to underestimate risk. Although net benefit indicated that the model provides meaningful clinical usefulness in identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive interventions, recalibration and updating the model according to national data is recommended.

cardio,"Seven previously unreported sesquiterpenes including three rare 5/5/6-fused tricyclic gymnomitrane-type sesquiterpenes (1-3), an ent-longipinane-type sesquiterpene (4), a cuparane-type sesquiterpene (5), and two chamigrane-type sesquiterpenes (6 and 7), along with a known chamigrane-type sesquiterpene xylariterpenoid C (8) were isolated from the hydrothermal vent sediment derived fungus Penicillium sp. JWM79-5-1. Their structures were identified on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR, in conjunction with Mosher's method, X-ray crystallography, and electronic circular dichroism (ECD). The antithrombotic activity of compounds 1-6 and 8 was evaluated in arachidonic acid (AA)-induced zebrafish thrombosis model in vivo. The results revealed compound 1 with potent antithrombotic activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Further, the pro-angiogenic activities of compounds 1-6 and 8 were evaluated in a transgenic zebrafish model that expresses vegfr2, the receptor for the angiogenic factor VEGF, tagged with the green fluorescence protein (vegfr2-GFP) through detecting the length of both intersegmental vessels (ISVs) and subintestinal veins (SIVs). The results revealed that compound 1 exhibited a potent antithrombotic activity while 3 revealed a potent pro-angiogenic activity. These findings strongly support drug development of these compounds in cardiovascular disease treatment.

cardio,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in developed countries, complicating 4-11 % of pregnancies. Women with CVD are at increased risk of maternal complications, including heart failure and arrhythmias, as well as adverse fetal outcomes such as preterm birth and perinatal mortality. Traditionally, care for pregnant women with CVD has been fragmented across specialties, leading to discontinuity and missed opportunities for optimization. To address this, recent European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines strongly recommend the implementation of a pregnancy heart team: a dedicated multidisciplinary team providing integrated care for this high-risk population. We describe the implementation and organization of a pregnancy heart team in our academic tertiary hospital. The core team consists of a cardiologist specialized in cardio-obstetrics, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, and an obstetric anesthesiologist, with additional experts consulted as required. Patients are discussed at predefined time points: preconception, during pregnancy, and postpartum. Standardized risk assessment using the modified World Health Organization (mWHO) classification guides counseling, management, and delivery planning. Shared decision-making is central, balancing maternal and fetal risks with patient preferences. The team establishes individualized peripartum care plans covering timing, mode, and location of delivery, anesthesia strategies, anticoagulation management, and postpartum monitoring. This structured, multidisciplinary model ensures continuity of care and offers a practical framework to improve outcomes in women with CVD during pregnancy."
cardio,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The correlation between systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) and both cardiovascular disease (CVD, including myocardial infarction and total stroke) and mortality in individuals with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) remains unclear. We examined this association in a large Chinese cohort. METHODS: A population of 24,340 patients with MASLD from the Kailuan study were observed over a median of 16.0 years. SIRI was calculated based on neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for CVD and mortality across SIRI quartiles. Net reclassification improvement assessed SIRI's predictive value vs. high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and other indices. Mediation analysis assessed the roles of platelet count (PLT), Chinese visceral adiposity index and triglyceride-glucose index. RESULTS: During follow-up, 4,171 CVD events and 4,510 deaths occurred. Elevated SIRI was significantly linked to higher risks of CVD (HR for Q4 vs. Q1 1.21; 95% CI 1.10-1.31; p <0.001), including myocardial infarction (HR 1.22; 95% CI 1.01-1.48; p = 0.045), total stroke (HR 1.18; 95% CI 1.06-1.31; p = 0.003), and mortality (HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.24-1.46; p <0.001) in MASLD. Associations were stronger among women (HR 1.17; 95% CI 1.07-1.29; p <0.01) and physically inactive individuals (HR 1.09; 95% CI 1.05-1.13; p <0.01). SIRI improved outcome prediction over high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and other indices, with significant reclassification gains (5.84; 95% CI 2.57-9.12; p <0.001). Triglyceride-glucose index partially mediated these associations (5.3% for CVD, p = 0.006; 2.9% for mortality, p = 0.003), whereas PLT exhibited a slight inverse mediation effect on mortality (-3.3%, p = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: High SIRI independently correlates with increased risk of CVD and mortality in MASLD. These findings highlight the role of systemic inflammation and support SIRI as a potential biomarker for risk stratification in these individuals. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: This study provides important evidence linking systemic inflammation, as measured by the systemic inflammation response index, to increased cardiovascular disease and mortality in individuals with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), a prevalent condition with rising global burden. The findings underscore the clinical relevance of inflammation markers in cardiovascular risk stratification, particularly for patients and healthcare providers managing MASLD. Physicians and policymakers could incorporate systemic inflammation response index into routine assessments to identify patients with MASLD at higher risk of cardiovascular events, potentially guiding targeted interventions aimed at mitigating systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Nonetheless, due to the predominantly male, community-based cohort from northern China, further research across diverse populations is warranted to confirm these associations before widespread clinical implementation.

cardio,"BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is a leading contributor to cardiovascular disease and mortality worldwide, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Educational attainment, as a key socioeconomic indicator, has been consistently associated with cardiovascular risk in observational studies. However, the causal nature of this relationship remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the potential causal association between educational attainment and the risk of atherosclerosis using Mendelian randomization (MR) methods. METHODS: We performed a two-sample MR analysis using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics. Educational attainment, measured as college completion and years of schooling, was used as the exposure, and atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and cerebral atherosclerosis were the outcomes. Causal estimates were obtained using inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger, and weighted median approaches. Sensitivity analyses, including pleiotropy and heterogeneity tests, were conducted to validate the robustness of the results. RESULTS: Using the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, genetically predicted higher educational attainment (college completion) was associated with a lower risk of atherosclerosis (OR = 0.43, 95 % CI: 0.32-0.57, P = 1.79E-08) and coronary artery disease (OR = 0.57, 95 % CI: 0.46-0.71, P = 6.62E-07). Additionally, an inverse association was observed between genetically predicted years of education and coronary artery disease risk (OR = 0.95, 95 % CI: 0.93-0.97, P = 2.85E-06). No significant association was found with cerebral atherosclerosis (P > 0.05). Sensitivity analyses indicated no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy or substantial bias. Although the associations did not reach statistical significance in MR-Egger or weighted mode analyses, the odds ratios remained below 1 across these methods, suggesting consistent protective trends and supporting the robustness of the findings. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide genetic evidence supporting a potential causal association between educational attainment and the risk of atherosclerosis, particularly coronary artery disease. These associations likely reflect indirect effects mediated by socioeconomic and behavioral pathways. Future research should investigate the mechanisms underlying these associations and explore how educational inequalities contribute to cardiovascular health disparities."
cardio,"INTRODUCTION: Weight gain and central obesity are common in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. In the general population, body roundness index (BRI) has been found to be a convenient anthropometric measurement for the assessment of central obesity and visceral adiposity. However, the role of BRI in PD patients has not been explored. METHODS: We recruited 145 new PD patients. BRI, body composition by bioimpedance spectroscopy, and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) were measured at baseline and then after 1 year of PD. Patients were stratified into four groups based on their changes in BRI after 1 year of PD, using the traditional BRI cutoff of 5. Outcome measures include patient survival and hospitalization rate. RESULTS: The change in BRI after 1 year of PD had a modest but significant correlation with the change in HOMA-IR (r = 0.497, p = 0.041). For the group with baseline BRI <5, patients who had their BRI raised to >/=5 (low-high group, n = 20) had significantly lower patient and technique survival rates than those whose BRI remained <5 (low-low group, n = 55), and the result remained significant after adjusting for clinical confounders by multi-variable Cox regression (adjusted hazard ratio 2.885, 95% CI: 1.278-6.509, p = 0.011). The low-high group also had significantly higher hospitalization rates (2.51 [1.63-3.93] vs. 0.98 [0.26-1.91] per year, p = 0.0008) and longer hospitalization stay (17.3 [12.2-35.5] vs. 5.0 [1.0-13.3] days per year, p = 0.015) than the low-low group. CONCLUSION: An increase in BRI after 1 year of PD was associated with worsening of insulin resistance, worse patient survival, and more hospitalization."
neuro,"Epilepsy (EP), a prevalent neurological disorder, lacks a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis. Multiple studies highlight that hippocampal (Hip) neuronal injury may serve as an essential underlying factor in EP onset and progression. Accumulating evidence shows that autophagy (Apg) has an essential function in supporting cell survival and sustaining cellular and tissue homeostasis. This investigation aimed to examine and further validate hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha/BNIP3 signaling in the Hip neuronal Apg in a lithium chloride-pilocarpine (LiCl-Pilo)-induced EP rat model. We retrieved the GSE143272 dataset and generally validated Apg-related genes (ATGs) expression and its diagnostic roles in EP through differential expression analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI), enrichment analysis, and four machine learning (ML) models. Afterward, the predictive performance of the ML models was evaluated via a nomogram model and validated with an external dataset (GSE63808). Finally, the function of the HIF-1alpha/BNIP3 pathway in regulating Apg through HIF-1alpha inhibition was systematically validated in the LiCl-Pilo-induced chronic EP rat model. Our data identified eleven ATGs as differentially expressed. Among them, HIF-1alpha and BNIP3 were found to be closely associated, exhibiting a negative regulatory interaction. The ML model XGB exhibited superior performance in differentiating EP patients. Subsequent experimental validation confirmed elevated Apg markers and HIF-1alpha levels, along with decreased BNIP3 levels. Inhibition of HIF-1alpha upregulated HIF-1alpha/BNIP3-modulated Apg and attenuated Hip neuron damage and mitochondrial damage induced by LiCl-Pilo-induced EP. Collectively, these outcomes suggest that HIF-1alpha/BNIP3 signaling might be involved in neuronal damage by mediating Hip Apg, thereby regulating epileptic seizures."
neuro,"Migraine is a highly prevalent neurological disorder that imposes significant personal and economic burdens worldwide. However, the causal relationships between these biological factors and migraine remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate these causal relationships using robust genetic epidemiological methods to identify potential therapeutic targets for improved migraine management. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach was used to assess the causal roles of three major categories of biological factors: metabolites (metabolites, blood and urine biomarkers), immune (inflammatory factors and immune cells), and microbiota (intestinal and skin flora). Genetic instruments were derived from large-scale genome-wide association studies. Bayesian weighted MR (BWMR) analyses were conducted to validate the robustness of findings. Colocalization analyses were performed to determine whether significant associations were mediated through known migraine-related pathogenic or therapeutic genes. The study identified 30 putative causal factors for migraine, including 16 metabolites, 5 immune cell profiles, 3 inflammatory markers, 5 intestinal floras, and 1 skin floras. Among the metabolites, the alpha-ketoglutarate to ornithine ratio and the spermidine to choline ratio were significant risk factors, whereas alliin and (2,4 or 2,5)-dimethylphenol sulfate were identified as protective factors. No significant associations were observed for blood and urine biomarkers. Colocalization analyses indicated that these factors influence migraine risk through pathways independent of known pathogenic or therapeutic genes. This study provides novel genetic evidence supporting the causal roles of metabolites, inflammatory markers, immune cell profiles, and microbiota in migraine etiology. The findings highlight potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for migraine management."
neuro,"BACKGROUND: Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and, in the case of narcolepsy type 1, cataplexy. Patients may also experience various sleep disturbances, including hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and vivid dreaming. Beyond its clinical symptoms, narcolepsy impacts aspects of daily life, social functioning, emotional well-being, and overall quality of life. Despite the substantial burden associated with the disorder, qualitative research exploring the emotional burden of individuals with narcolepsy is limited. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted using narrative semi-structured interviews with 25 individuals diagnosed with narcolepsy. The interview framework was validated by a multidisciplinary panel of experts to ensure methodological rigor. Interviews were conducted either in the patients' homes or hospital settings, transcribed verbatim, and then analyzed inductively to develop a comprehensive codebook. A thematic analysis was then performed to identify key patterns and insights into the lived experiences of individuals with narcolepsy. RESULTS: In-depth patient interviews revealed key themes related to the emotional burden of narcolepsy. The onset of symptoms was identified as particularly distressing, evoking feelings of shame, embarrassment, and fear. Symptom manifestation also affected self-perception and important roles in life. Additionally, patients' experiences of daily life, along with their future aspirations and expectations, contributed to a comprehensive understanding of the challenges associated with narcolepsy. CONCLUSION: The impact of narcolepsy is linked with the emotional experiences and self-perception of patients, influencing their quality of life. This burden may also contribute to potential diagnostic delays and hinder the timely initiation of treatment."
neuro,"BACKGROUND: Epilepsy, a chronic neurological disorder affecting more than 65 million people worldwide, is characterized by recurrent seizures caused by abnormal neuronal discharges. Beyond its diverse etiologies, growing evidence suggests that environmental and meteorological factors, including air pollution, may influence seizure occurrence. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between meteorological variables, air pollutants, and hospital admissions for seizures in the province of Lleida (Spain) over a 10-year period (2010-2019). METHODS: Daily hospital admissions for seizures (ICD-10 code G40) were analyzed together with meteorological variables (temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, precipitation, and solar irradiation) and air pollutants (NO(2), PM(10), CO, O(3), and SO(2)). Distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) with quasi-Poisson regression were applied to estimate exposure-response relationships and delayed effects, adjusting for long-term trends, seasonality, and day of the week. RESULTS: A total of 4,755 seizure-related admissions were recorded, representing 0.52% of all emergency visits. The frequency of seizures increased during colder months and periods of poor air quality. Low daily mean temperatures (<2.5th percentile) and high NO(2) concentrations (>99th percentile) were both significantly associated with higher seizure risk (up to +40% and +42% relative risk, respectively; p < 0.05). The association with NO(2) remained significant after adjusting for temperature. CONCLUSION: Cold temperatures and elevated NO(2) levels are independently associated with an increased number of seizure-related emergency admissions. These findings highlight the potential neurological impact of air pollution and extreme weather, emphasizing the need for preventive public health measures and further research to clarify the underlying mechanisms."
neuro,"INTRODUCTION: Alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) is a complex neurological disorder comprising paroxysmal episodes of repeated, transient paresis involving either or both sides of the body, with onset usually before the age of 18 months. The etiology is varied and includes channelopathy, mutations of the ATP1A3 gene that encode alpha subunit of the NA(+)-K(+) ATPase pump. CASE PRESENTATION: A 7-month-old girl presented with tonic neck deviation of the neck and eyes, episodic hemiparesis affecting both sides alternatively. Each episode resolved after sleep and was precipitated by hunger, fever, and sleep deprivation. Neurological examination and laboratory workup, including MRI and EEG, were normal. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous de novo pathogenic mutation in the ATP1A3 gene (p.Asp801Asn), confirming AHC. She was started on flunarizine, a calcium channel blocker. Significant clinical improvement and catch-up in developmental milestones were observed on follow-up. CONCLUSION: AHC is frequently misdiagnosed due to its rarity and varied presentation. Diagnosis is clinical and supported by genetic testing. Mutations in ATP1A3 are common and often cluster at specific hotspots. Management includes symptomatic treatment and supportive care, with flunarizine offering some benefit. This case highlights the need for early recognition and genetic confirmation of AHC to initiate therapy and improve quality of life."
neuro,"OBJECTIVE: Adductor laryngeal dystonia (AdLD) is a neurological disorder characterized by spasms of the laryngeal muscles during speech, resulting in acoustic discontinuities. High-speed videoendoscopy (HSV) has been used to capture supraglottic compression and visual obstructions of the vocal folds during sustained phonation in speakers with AdLD. The purpose of this study was to investigate the co-occurrence of these laryngeal postures via HSV and acoustic discontinuities in speakers with and without AdLD during connected speech. METHODS: Speakers with (n = 16) and without (n = 16) AdLD read sentences while undergoing trans nasal laryngoscopy. Microphone and HSV signals were simultaneously recorded. Acoustic discontinuities and laryngeal postures via HSV were independently manually labeled. A multinomial logistic regression was performed to examine the relationship between the presence of acoustic discontinuities-labeled as phonatory break, creak, or frequency shift-and that of view of vocal fold obstruction and supraglottic compression. Additional fixed factors included in the regression model were group (AdLD, control), sex, and the interactions of group x obstruction and group x supraglottic compression. RESULTS: Factors that were significantly associated with the odds of an acoustic discontinuity included group, vocal fold obstruction, supraglottic compression, and the interaction of group x vocal fold obstruction. There was not a significant interaction effect of group on supraglottic compression events. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that acoustic discontinuities co-occur with supraglottic compression and vocal fold obstructions. Understanding this relationship may lead to more effective voice assessment methods for individuals with AdLD."
neuro,"Epilepsy, a prevalent neurological disorder, is characterized by recurrent, self-sustained seizures resulting from abnormal neuronal hyperexcitability. Epilepsy encompasses a wide spectrum of etiologies, pathophysiological mechanisms, and treatment responses, resulting in considerable phenotypic heterogeneity. Over the past few decades, animal models, ranging from simple organisms to complex species, have played a pivotal role in elucidating the cellular, molecular, and circuit mechanisms underlying seizure generation and propagation, while also facilitating the development of antiseizure medication and other therapeutic interventions. This review first outlines the mechanistic basis of epilepsy and systematically summarizes existing seizure and epilepsy models across diverse taxa, including zebrafish, rodents, and non-human primates (NHPs), with a focus on model-specific features, translational relevance, and therapeutic utility. Despite substantial progress, limitations persist in recapitulating the full complexity of human epilepsy. Recent advances in genetic engineering, neuromodulation technology, and brain organoids are refining model fidelity and enhancing alignment with precision medicine approaches. Cross-species integration offers a promising avenue for bridging preclinical findings with clinical application, advancing mechanistic insight, and the development of targeted therapies."
neuro,"INTRODUCTION: New neurological symptoms in neuro-oncology patients are usually attributed to the tumor or its treatment. A diagnosis of functional neurological disorder (FND) is often only considered when investigations do not reveal a cause and medical management fails. The consequences to neuro-oncology patients of comorbid FND have not been elaborated. METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective case study of adult neuro-oncology patients with an intracranial tumor who presented acutely with FND and required expedited investigations. Data recorded were tumor type, investigations, adverse life events, medical interventions, and outcomes. This was combined with a systematic literature review. RESULTS: Ten patients met our study criteria. Six had functional seizures, two had functional hemiparesis, and two had functional speech disorders. FND symptoms started prior to tumor diagnosis in three patients; between diagnosis and tumor treatment in three patients; and after treatment commenced in four patients. Two patients were thrombolyzed for a presumed stroke. Three patients had either their tumor surgery or chemoradiotherapy delayed. Diagnosis and management of FND enabled tumor treatment to restart. The systematic review identified 43 patients. Thirty-nine had functional seizures, and four had motor FND. All FNDs except one started after tumor treatment commenced. CONCLUSION: Acute FND can occur at any stage of a brain tumor illness. The FND may lead to unnecessary medical interventions and can disrupt tumor treatment. Although acute FND improved with diagnosis and explanation, many neuro-oncology patients require a multidisciplinary tumor-FND pathway to manage acute FND and avoid delays to tumor treatment."
neuro,"Frequent convulsions are a hallmark of the neurological disorder ""epilepsy,"" which calls for long-term anticonvulsant medication treatment. Traditional antiseizure medications primarily modulate neurotransmitter systems or ion channels but do not address the underlying neuroinflammation and metabolic dysfunctions that contribute to epileptogenesis. Trimetazidine (TMZ), a cytoprotective agent, has shown potential in reducing seizures at higher doses, but its bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy can be enhanced through intranasal nanoliposomal delivery. This study investigates the formulation, optimization, and evaluation of TMZ-loaded Liposomal Nanocarriers (NTMZ) for enhanced anticonvulsant, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. NTMZ was designed and optimized using a Box-Behnken design to evaluate the effects of phospholipid concentration, surfactant percentage, and sonication time on particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), and encapsulation efficiency (EE%). The formulations were characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In vitro release, ex vivo permeation studies, and antioxidant activity assays were conducted. Pharmacological efficacy was evaluated through pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced kindling and increasing current electroshock seizure (ICES) models in Swiss Albino mice. Biochemical analysis of inflammatory markers (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha), neurotransmitter levels (GABA, glutamate), and neuroinflammatory signaling (NF-kappaB, HMGB1-TLR4) was also performed. NTMZ displayed a particle size of 241.9 nm, a PDI of 0.465, and an entrapment efficiency of 87%. In vitro release showed an initial burst release of 62% in 8 h, followed by sustained release over 24 h. TEM analysis confirmed uniform spherical morphology, and stability tests indicated robust formulations. In vivo studies revealed that 5 mg NTMZ significantly outperformed standard TMZ in PTZ and ICES models, reducing seizure severity and cognitive deficits. NTMZ also suppressed neuroinflammatory markers (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, HMGB1, TLR4, and NF-kappaB), enhanced GABAergic neurotransmission, and lowered glutamate levels. These findings demonstrate the potential of intranasal delivery of NTMZ as a novel formulation for managing epilepsy through its improved bioavailability, reduced dose, sustained release, and potent neuroprotective properties. Simultaneously, pharmacological modulation of neuroinflammation and neurotransmitters were observed."
neuro,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a neurological disorder that primarily affects older adults and is typically characterized clinically by a triad of symptoms: gait disturbance, urinary urgency or incontinence, and cognitive decline. The relationship between clinical presentation and iNPH imaging biomarkers remains unclear, as does the ability of these markers to predict outcomes following cerebrospinal fluid diversion. Additionally, the association between fecal incontinence (FI) and iNPH, as well as the relationship between FI and iNPH imaging biomarkers, is poorly understood. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on 125 consecutive iNPH patients treated by a single surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital between 2015 and 2023. Patients were treated with the placement of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. Patient demographics, symptoms, and clinical improvement were recorded at 3 and 12 months post-shunt placement. Imaging biomarkers, including Evans Index (EI), callosal angle (CA), anteroposterior diameter of the lateral ventricle index (ALVI), and disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus score, were measured using preoperative imaging. RESULTS: Of 125 patients (mean age 74.8 years, 71 males), 124 presented with gait disturbance, 113 with urinary dysfunction, and 111 with cognitive decline. FI was present in 24 patients. Patients with preoperative FI had higher EI and ALVI. Patients with improved FI at 3-month follow-up had larger CA. Patients with improved gait at 12-month follow-up had smaller EI and ALVI scores. Patients with preoperative urinary symptoms had a higher EI. CONCLUSIONS: Imaging biomarkers can have both diagnostic utility and predictive potential for outcomes related to specific symptoms following CSF diversion with VP shunts."
neuro,"Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. Despite significant progress in epilepsy research, about 30% of patients continue to experience uncontrolled seizures and clear diagnostic criteria remain elusive. Abnormal glycosylation contributes to various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. However, it is unclear whether protein glycosylation is altered in epilepsy. Herein, we established a chronic epilepsy rat model by injecting kainic acid solution into the right lateral ventricle and examined the changes in protein N-glycosylation and O-GlcNAcylation in rat brain tissues using mass spectrometry and lectin blotting. We found a significant reduction in complex N-glycan abundance in the hippocampal tissue of epileptic rats, which may be related to decreased MGAT1 expression. Additionally, we observed a marked decrease in protein O-GlcNAcylation, which may be associated with reduced levels of GFPT1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. This research offers new insight into potential therapeutic strategies for epilepsy."
neuro,"Dopamine, a critical neurotransmitter regulating motor control, cognition, and reward pathways, requires sensitive and selective detection methods for neurological disorder diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring. We developed a novel dual-emission ratiometric fluorescence sensor comprising near-infrared carbon dots (NIR-CDs, lambda(em) = 730 nm) and the alizarin red S-3-nitrophenylboronic acid complex (ARS-3-NPBA, lambda(em) = 550 nm) under single 450 nm excitation for dopamine quantification based on competitive boronate affinity displacement, wherein dopamine's catechol moiety displaces ARS from 3-NPBA, simultaneously decreasing ARS-3-NPBA fluorescence at 550 nm while recovering inner-filter-quenched NIR-CD fluorescence at 730 nm. The self-calibrating fluorescence ratio (F(730)/F(550)) exhibits excellent linear correlation with dopamine concentration over 0.1-65.0 muM (R(2) = 0.9946) with a limit of detection of 0.035 muM. The sensor demonstrates superior selectivity, showing negligible interference from common biological species. Spike-and-recovery experiments in human plasma yielded recovery percentages of 97.0 % to 98.3 % with RSD values of 2.53 %-4.23 %. The ratiometric readout inherently corrects for instrumental variations, photobleaching, and matrix effects, positioning this platform as a robust, cost-effective alternative to conventional chromatographic methods for dopamine quantification in clinical diagnostics and potential real-time in vivo monitoring applications."
neuro,"BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is characterized as a heterogeneous neurological disorder, which causes a variety of behavioral and functional impairments. Continentalic acid (CA), a diterpenoid acid obtained from Aralia continentalis, possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant properties. METHODS: In the current study we investigated the neuroprotective properties of CA in an experimental TBI model. An in vivo, weight-drop model of TBI was developed in male BALB/c mice. Following traumatic insult, CA (1, 10, and 50 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally for up to 14 days. To assess the protective effects of CA, we performed behavioral tests, spectroscopy, histopathology, and biochemical analyses. RESULTS: The results revealed that CA significantly attenuated trauma-evoked neurological functions and improved mechanical as well as periorbital allodynia. CA also restored the structural and molecular composition of traumatized brain tissues. Similarly, CA reversed the histological changes in the cortex region of the traumatized brain sections and improved the neuronal count. CA administration also decreased the level of traumatic microbleeds in the brain. The expression levels of GFAP and Iba1 were significantly reduced by CA. Treatment with CA significantly reduced the expression of TLR-4, NF-kappaB, and increased the expression of IkB-alpha regulatory protein. CA also downregulated the expression of cleaved caspase-3 protein and upregulated the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein and alleviated the DNA damage. CA dramatically improved the levels of GST, GSH, catalase, and SOD while concomitantly reducing NO and LPO levels. The levels of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were also reduced in the treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that CA (50 mg/kg) exhibited neuroprotective activity in TBI by attenuating inflammation, neuronal apoptosis, and oxidative stress."
neuro,"OBJECTIVE: This work was undertaken to describe the level of evidence for co-occurring epileptic seizures in patients with known functional/dissociative seizures (FDS) using stratification criteria analogous to the International League Against Epilepsy criteria for functional seizures. METHODS: Adult patients (age  >/=  18 years) with ""documented"" or ""clinically established"" FDS seen in a health system with a multidisciplinary FDS clinic were manually evaluated by retrospective chart review to identify their risk of co-occurring epilepsy. They were grouped into five mutually exclusive categories based on ""red flags"" for co-occurring epilepsy in the clinical history, semiology of unobserved seizures, and neurodiagnostic data. The categories of concern for co-occurring epilepsy were as follows: unlikely, possible, probable, clinically established, and documented. RESULTS: We identified 460 patients with FDS (median age = 34 years, interquartile range = 24-46 years, 78% female). The majority (62.6%, 95% confidence interval = 58%-67%) had ""unlikely"" co-occurring epilepsy due to no ""red flags."" Some (11.5%) patients had high likelihood of co-occurring epilepsy: 10.2% electroencephalographically ""documented"" and 1.3% ""clinically established."" There were 74 (16.5%) patients with neurodiagnostic ""red flags"" indicating ""probable"" co-occurring epilepsy. The remaining 9.3% had historical reports of ""red flags"" indicating ""possible"" co-occurring epilepsy. SIGNIFICANCE: The majority (62.6%) of people with FDS were ""unlikely"" to have co-occurring epilepsy due to the lack of ""red flags."" Conversely, 11.5% of patients with FDS had a high level of certainty of co-occurring epileptic seizures (clinically established and documented). In patients with intermediate concern, patient-centered decision-making can guide the next steps of diagnosis and treatment."
neuro,"PURPOSE: Migraine is a neurological disorder, affecting approximately 1.16 billion individuals globally. Zinc finger HIT-type containing 1 (Znhit1), a chromatin remodeler, has exhibited a neuroprotective role. This study aims to investigate the role of Znhit1 in migraine. METHODS: A migraine mouse model was established by repeated intraperitoneal injection of nitroglycerin (NTG). The Znhit1 expression in trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) was detected using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot assays. Behavioral phenotype caused by central sensitization was assessed by Von Frey monofilaments and hot plate assays. Inflammatory response was evaluated through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot analysis. Gene set enrichment analysis, western blot, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), and flow cytometry were utilized to explore potential molecular mechanisms in vitro. RESULTS: Repeated injection of NTG reduced Znhit1 expression in the TNC. Overexpression of Znhit1 alleviated hyperalgesia, upregulated 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) level, and inhibited FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (c-Fos) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) expression. Moreover, overexpression of Znhit1 downregulated the expression of inflammatory markers [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)] and inhibited the activation of NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. CCK-8 assay found that cell viability was enhanced in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV2 cells treated with Znhit1 overexpression, while silencing of Znhit1 resulted in decreased cell viability. In LPS-induced BV2 cells, silencing of Znhit1 enhanced inflammatory response, promoted cell apoptosis, and activated NLRP3 inflammasome, whereas MCC950, a specific inhibitor of NLRP3, reversed these effects induced by silencing of Znhit1. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that Znhit1 ameliorated hyperalgesia and inhibited inflammatory response by suppressing the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome."
neuro,"BACKGROUND: Migraine without aura (MWoA) is a neurological disorder associated with structural and functional abnormalities in white matter (WM). However, interactions between clinical characteristics and WM abnormalities of microstructure and function in MWoA have remained underexplored. In this study, we aimed to investigate these associations and broaden the understanding of the pathophysiology of MWoA. METHODS: A total of 51 MWoA patients and 51 healthy controls (HCs) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Microstructural WM abnormalities were assessed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Functional alterations were evaluated by measuring the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and degree centrality (DC). Spearman's rank correlation was used to assess the association between these abnormalities and clinical characteristics such as frequency, intensity, and disease progression of MWoA. We also conducted a region-level functional connectivity analysis, followed by mediation analysis to explore potential pathways linking WM abnormalities to clinical characteristics. RESULTS: This study showed that, compared to HCs, MWoA patients showed decreased fractional anisotropy (FA), axial dispersion (AD), and DC and increased ALFF in the left frontopontine (FPT_L), decreased FA and AD in the forceps major (CC_ForcepsMajor), and decreased ALFF in the forceps minor (CC_ForcepsMinor). Among them, ALFF in the CC_ForcepsMinor and DC, FA, and AD in the FPT_L were inversely correlated with disease duration (p < 0.05). FA and AD in the CC_ForcepsMajor were inversely correlated with visual analog scale (VAS) scores (p < 0.05). Exploratory mediation analysis suggested that functional and microstructural abnormalities in the corpus callosum (CC) subregions may mediate the relationship between the DC value in the FPT-L and disease duration among MWoA patients. CONCLUSION: This study reveals concomitant alterations in the function and microstructure of WM in the CC subregions and the FPT_L among MWoA patients. These alterations are significantly correlated with clinical characteristics and suggest that these abnormalities in functional fluctuations and WM integrity may serve as mediators between reduced network integration and disease duration in MWoA. These findings support the WM abnormality hypothesis and deepen our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MWoA."
neuro,"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains a devastating neurological disorder with high mortality, driven primarily by uncontrolled neuroinflammation and secondary brain injury. Here, we show that human umbilical mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (hUMSC-Exos) robustly promote functional recovery in a murine ICH model by reprogramming microglial biology and mitigating neuronal damage, via a mechanism dependent on the NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase SIRT1. Intranasal delivery of hUMSC-Exos enabled efficient uptake by perihematomal microglia, astrocytes, and neurons, reducing neuronal apoptosis and improving both sensorimotor and cognitive outcomes. Microglia-specific transcriptomic profiling revealed that hUMSC-Exos suppressed ICH-induced proinflammatory gene networks, particularly those governed by NF-kappaB/NOS2 signaling, while attenuating pathological microglial proliferation. Mechanistically, hUMSC-Exos upregulated SIRT1, which repressed NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and subsequent NOS2 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of SIRT1 with EX527 abrogated key beneficial effects of hUMSC-Exos: it reversed the suppression of microglial proliferation, restored neuronal apoptosis to ICH levels, and eliminated improvements in locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, and spatial learning/memory-assessed via open field and Morris water maze tests. Conversely, NOS2 blockade recapitulated the neuroprotective actions of hUMSC-Exos. Beyond anti-inflammatory effects, hUMSC-Exos promoted transcriptional programs linked to tissue remodeling and vascular regeneration, underscoring their dual role in mitigating injury and enhancing repair. Collectively, our study identifies a SIRT1-dependent axis through which stem cell-derived exosomes orchestrate microglial homeostasis and neuronal survival after ICH, establishing exosome-based therapy as a promising cell-free strategy for acute brain injury with translational potential.

neuro,"KIF1A-Associated Neurological Disorder (KAND) is a rare, progressive neurodegenerative condition caused by variants in the KIF1A gene, which encodes a kinesin-3 motor protein essential for anterograde axonal transport of synaptic vesicles, dense core vesicles, and organelles in neurons. KAND comprises a broad spectrum of overlapping neurological phenotypes, including hereditary spastic paraplegia, intellectual disability, peripheral neuropathy, optic nerve atrophy, epilepsy, and progressive motor decline. Pathogenic variants in KIF1A disrupt the balance of intracellular transport and neuronal signalling through diverse mechanisms, manifesting with highly variable disease onset, severity, and clinical progression. Although advances in genomic testing have improved diagnosis, reported KAND cases remain concentrated in developed countries, highlighting ongoing global inequities in access to diagnosis and care. At present, no cure exists for KAND; treatment is limited to symptom management. A deeper understanding of KIF1A function, supported by the development of robust cellular and animal models, is critical for therapeutic development. This review summarises the clinical and molecular features of KAND and highlights current and emerging strategies aimed at slowing disease progression or correcting its underlying causes. We emphasise the urgent need for targeted treatment strategies addressing the heterogeneity of KAND."
neuro,"Alzheimer's disease is a prominent neurological disorder, which leads to progressive dementia. The microtubule-associated protein Tau is considered one of the major causes of Alzheimer's disease. Hyper-phosphorylation of Tau is considered to be closely associated with the generation of Tau pathology. CDK5 is one of the prominent neuronal kinases, under normal conditions, the activity of CDK5 is regulated by p35 protein. The stress conditions result in calpain-mediated proteolytic cleavage of p35 leading to the generation of p25 and p10. CDK5/p25 complex is reported to have a relatively more half-life which causes hyperphosphorylation of many proteins leading to neurotoxicity but the role of p10 is still needed to be explored. In the present review, we hypothesized the role of p10 as CDK5/p25 inhibitor. The current research has demonstrated that p10 provides survival signals to cells. In the current scenario, several CDK5 inhibitors commonly have a drawback of non-specificity. Here based on complied studies we hypothesize that the p10 could have the potency to inhibit the activity of CDK5, which ultimately downregulate the hyperphosphorylation of Tau. Thus reducing the levels of phospho-Tau p10 could emerge as a novel therapeutic peptide against Alzheimer's disease. The proposed hypothesis would open new gates for research in the field of Alzheimer's and further would bring a new ray of hope for the disease."
neuro,"BACKGROUND: Emergence delirium (ED), a common postoperative neurological disorder in children, is characterized by disturbances in consciousness, attention, disorientation, and perceptual changes. Intraoperative burst suppression has been associated with postoperative delirium in adults, and its relationship with emergence delirium in children remains unclear and controversial. METHODS: This investigation was conducted at Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, from January 2022 to January 2023. The study incorporated children aged 6 months to 9 years who were undergoing general anesthesia with electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. Intraoperative processed EEG and the incidence of burst suppression were recorded. Postoperative delirium was evaluated using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scale. A score of 10 points or higher on this scale was used as an indicator of the presence of emergence delirium. RESULTS: Among the 207 children enrolled, the incidence of emergence delirium was 43 % in the set of children with burst suppression, whereas it was only 7 % in the non-burst suppression set. Binary logistic regression analysis pinpointed two distinct risk factors for the emergence of delirium. These were the agent used for maintenance of anesthesia and intraoperative burst suppression. Children maintained under intravenous propofol for maintenance of anesthesia experienced 57 % lower incidence of emergence delirium than those maintained under sevoflurance for anesthesia maintenance. Furthermore, children with burst suppression were eight times more likely to develop emergence delirium, according to intraoperative processed EEG monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a notable association between intraoperative burst suppression and the incidence of postoperative emergence delirium. These findings suggest that processed EEG-based monitoring and tailored anesthesia strategies may help prevent emergence delirium and other unfavorable outcomes in pediatric surgical patients."
neuro,"INTRODUCTION: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by abnormal neuronal discharges in the brain, posing a persistent challenge in clinical diagnosis. This study presents a high-performance epileptic seizure detection framework that integrates advanced feature extraction and classification techniques using EEG signals. METHODS: We conduct experiments on the Bonn and CHB-MIT EEG datasets. The EEG signals are preprocessed through bandpass filtering and five-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) decomposition. From each sub-band, four representative features are systematically extracted. To mitigate severe class imbalance, we propose a two-stage balancing strategy: cluster centroid-based under-sampling initially reduces the interictal-to-ictal ratio to 2:1, followed by Borderline Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (BLSMOTE) in the feature space. A hybrid classification model that combines Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE) with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is proposed in the paper. The encoder weights from the pre-trained CSAE are transferred to the GRU-based classifier to enhance feature representation and model generalization. RESULTS: The proposed method achieves outstanding performance, with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, f1 score and AUC of 98.46, 98.27, 98.50, 98.36, 98.31, and 98.23% on the Bonn dataset, and 99.49, 99.21, 99.77, 99.49, 99.35, and 99.57% on the CHB-MIT dataset, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. DISCUSSION: This study introduces a novel framework combining cluster centroid-based under-sampling, BLSMOTE oversampling, and transfer learning via CSAE-GRU integration. The method offers a promising direction for reliable and clinically applicable automated epilepsy diagnosis."
neuro,"Epilepsy is a prevalent chronic neurological disorder, affecting approximately 70 million individuals globally, with its pathogenesis primarily attributed to recurrent seizures caused by abnormal neuronal discharges in the brain. Recent research has increasingly recognized the critical role of neuroinflammation in the central nervous system in the onset and progression of epilepsy. Furthermore, the gut-brain axis, a crucial link between gut microbiota and the central nervous system, facilitates communication through intricate pathways involving neural, immune, and endocrine mechanisms, and its involvement in epilepsy pathology is gaining significant attention. This review focuses on recent advances in neuroimmune interactions within the gut-brain axis in epilepsy. It explores the roles of inflammatory factors (e.g., IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha) and immune cells (e.g., microglia, macrophages, neutrophils) in epileptic pathophysiology, and systematically reviews relevant experimental and clinical studies. The article begins by providing an overview of the fundamental interactions between gut microbiota and the host immune system, before discussing how gut-derived immune signals influence the central nervous system via the gut-brain axis. The pathogenic mechanisms of key pro-inflammatory factors in epileptogenesis are then examined, including how IL-1beta promotes neuronal hyperexcitability, how IL-6 mediates neuroinflammation, and how TNF-alpha disrupts the balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition. Additionally, the article highlights the significant role of inflammatory cells in the central nervous system, particularly the activation of microglia and the infiltration of peripheral immune cells in epilepsy development. In conclusion, further investigation into the mechanisms of neuroimmune interactions in the gut-brain axis may lead to the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for epileptogenesis, offering new insights and directions for the treatment of refractory epilepsy."
neuro,"Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a rare but serious neurological disorder that often leads to significant morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics, epidemiological trends, and outcomes of GBS patients admitted to Jimma Medical Center (JMC). This was a mixed retrospective and prospective study conducted at JMC, a tertiary teaching hospital in southwest Ethiopia. Medical records of patients admitted with GBS from October 2017 to August 2021 were retrospectively reviewed, while patients admitted between September 2021 and October 2024 were prospectively recruited. Data were collected on socio-demographic information, clinical presentation, diagnostic tests, treatment, and discharge outcomes. Descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and Geographic Information System mapping were used to analyze the data. A total of 93 patients with GBS were admitted during the 7 year study period. The median age was 30 years (IQR: 23-40), and most patients (54.8%) were within the 15 to 30 age group. Admissions peaked between November and January each year, with notable increase since the end of 2021. Among the 54 patients with complete medical records, the most common presenting symptoms were extremity weakness (92.6%) and difficulty walking (59.3%), while ascending paralysis was observed in 70.4% of cases. Bulbar symptoms occurred in 31.5% of patients. Preceding infections, particularly flu-like symptoms, were reported by 46.3% of them. Overall, 77.8% required ICU care, with 42.6% needing mechanical ventilation. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was administered to only 14.8% of patients. The in-hospital mortality rate was 25.9%, and complications such as quadriplegia (46.3%) and depression (35.2%) were common. Patients who required mechanical ventilation faced a significantly higher risk of mortality (P < .05), with survival rates dropping to 0% by day 165 in this group. This study highlights a significant burden of GBS at JMC, with notable seasonal trends, high ICU admission rates, and substantial mortality. Early diagnoses, improved access to immunotherapy, and enhanced supportive care, especially for those with respiratory failure, are critical to improving outcomes. The findings underscore the need for robust public health strategies to prevent, manage, and mitigate the impact of GBS, particularly in low-resource settings like Ethiopia."
neuro,"Background and Objectives: Chronic migraines are a disabling neurological disorder with limited response to preventive pharmacological treatments. Greater occipital nerve (GON)-targeted radiofrequency (RF) procedures have emerged as promising interventions, yet long-term comparative data between pulsed RF (PRF) and continuous-lesion RF (LesionRF) remain scarce. This study evaluated the 12-month efficacy and safety of PRF versus LesionRF. Materials and Methods: A single-center cohort of 211 patients with chronic migraine diagnosed by ICHD-3 criteria (PRF = 107; LesionRF = 104) was analyzed. All patients had a positive diagnostic block and >/=12 months of follow-up. Interventions were performed under ultrasound guidance with standardized protocols (PRF: 42  degrees C, 4 min, 45 V; LesionRF: 80  degrees C, 90 s). The primary outcome was a change in monthly migraine days (MMD), while secondary outcomes included responder rates (>/=50% MMD reduction), pain intensity (VAS), functional outcomes (HIT-6, MIDAS), quality of life (SF-36, EQ-5D), medication use, retreatment, and complications. Results: Both groups improved, but LesionRF showed greater benefit. At 12 months, LesionRF achieved a larger MMD reduction (-4.8 days vs. PRF, p < 0.001), higher responder rates (83% vs. 65%, p = 0.01), and greater VAS decreases (-1.6, p < 0.001). Functional and quality-of-life scores improved more with LesionRF, with MIDAS reductions surpassing MCID and responder rates meeting PASS. Retreatment was less frequent with LesionRF (8% vs. 19%; HR 2.15, p = 0.037), and two LesionRF patients (1.9%) developed hematomas that resolved conservatively. Conclusions: Compared with PRF, LesionRF provided more sustained and clinically meaningful benefits for chronic migraines. Both approaches appeared to be safe, though confirmation in larger randomized trials is warranted."
neuro,"Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). Epileptogenesis is a multifaceted pathophysiological process that transforms a normal brain into one prone to chronic seizures. Targeting epileptogenesis is a compelling line of epilepsy therapy. Thus, discovering new drugs that oppose, mitigate, or modify epileptogenesis is a significant challenge in modern neuroscience. Our previous work demonstrated that, in a kainic acid (KA)-induced post-status epilepticus model, 28 days myo-inositol (MI) treatment reduces frequency and duration of motor and electrographic SRS even following cessation of treatment, for the following 4 weeks and identified MI as a promising antiepileptogenic compound To further evaluate the dose-dependent efficacy of MI, we applied the same experimental model using 30 mg/kg (dose used in earlier studies), 60 mg/kg, and 120 mg/kg to assess effects on hippocampal electrographic and motor SRS, as well as KA-induced spatial learning and memory impairment in a Morris water maze test. We found that MI had long-lasting, dose-dependent suppressive effects on behavioral and electrographic manifestations of epileptogenesis and ameliorated spatial learning and memory deficit induced by SE, with 60 mg/kg emerging as the most effective dose. Furthermore, we investigated transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations associated with the optimal MI dose and identified multiple affected pathways in the hippocampus. Interestingly, MI treatment resulted in transcriptomic upregulation and prevention of downregulation of several ion channel subunits, including GRIK3 and GRIN3A (kainate and NMDA receptor subunits) and the sodium channel subunit SCNB4. The obtained data highlight new molecular targets for epilepsy therapy and support the translational potential of MI."
neuro,"Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative neurological disorder that greatly affects motor and speech functions; therefore, early diagnosis is vital for improving patients' quality of life. This work introduces a unified and explainable AI framework for PD detection that integrates ensemble and deep learning models with transparent interpretability techniques. Methods: Acoustic features were extracted from the Parkinson's Voice Disorder Dataset, and a broad suite of machine learning and deep learning models was evaluated, including traditional classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Linear Regression, SVM), ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM), and neural architectures (CNN, LSTM, GAN). Results: The ensemble methods-specifically LightGBM (LGBM) and Random Forest (RF)-achieved the best performance, reaching state-of-the-art accuracy (98.01%) and ROC-AUC (0.9914). Deep learning models like CNN and GAN produced competitive results, validating their ability to capture nonlinear and generative voice patterns. XAI analysis revealed that nonlinear acoustic biomarkers such as spread2, PPE, and RPDE are the most influential predictors, consistent with clinical evidence of dysphonia in PD. Conclusions: The proposed framework achieves a strong balance between predictive accuracy and interpretability, representing a clinically relevant, scalable, and non-invasive solution for early Parkinson's detection."
neuro,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: A Petit Bleu de Gascogne (PBDG) dog presented with a progressive neurological disorder characterized by hind-limb weakness, anxiety and hallucinatory episodes, lip smacking, progressive vision loss, muscle atrophy, and ataxia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse brain atrophy. The dog was euthanized at approximately 23 months of age due to the progression of neurological signs. A study was undertaken to identify the molecular genetic basis of the disorder in this dog. METHODS: Microscopic analyses were performed to characterize the disease pathology and whole-genome sequencing was performed to identify the molecular genetic basis of the disorder. RESULTS: The proband exhibited pronounced accumulations of autofluorescent intracellular inclusions in the brain, retina, and heart with ultrastructural appearances similar to those of lysosomal storage bodies that accumulate in the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCLs), a group of progressive neurodegenerative disorders. Whole-genome sequence analysis of DNA from the proband identified homozygous missense variants in AP3B1 and TRAPPC9 that encode proteins involved in sorting and transport of proteins through the Golgi apparatus to lysosomes. Screening of unaffected PBDGs for these variants identified dogs that were homozygous for either variant, but no other dogs that were homozygous for both. CONCLUSIONS: These findings raise the possibility that the disease involves the combined influence of the two variants, and that the proteins encoded by these genes interact within the Golgi apparatus to mediate protein sorting and transport to lysosomes. An alteration in this interaction could underlie the NCL-like lysosomal storage disorder observed in the proband."
neuro,"Background Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an autosomal dominant neurological disorder caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. Disease-causing variants in NOTCH3 are primarily missense variants altering the number of cysteine residues in the translated NOTCH3 protein. The genetic screening of the NOTCH3 gene is currently considered the gold standard for CADASIL diagnosis. Methods The Genomics Research Centre has been performing diagnostic genetic testing for CADASIL since 1997. A total of 1281 patient samples suspected of having CADASIL were screened for NOTCH3 mutations from January 1, 1997, to October 1, 2025. Genomic sequencing was performed using Sanger sequencing of selected NOTCH3 exons or using next-generation sequencing to screen the entire NOTCH3 gene. Results In total, 12.1% of patients had a cysteine-altering NOTCH3 variant, including 49 variants in exons 2-24, and two variants in non-EGFr encoding exons. We also report the first CADASIL patient who is a compound heterozygote for two known pathogenic cysteine-altering NOTCH3 variants, who presented with a severe early onset of stroke, migraine, and white matter changes. Conclusions The compound heterozygosity identified in this patient appears to be associated with an early onset of CADASIL symptoms. Our study contributes to the elucidation of the spectrum of NOTCH3 variants associated with CADASIL. The majority of patients tested for CADASIL in this study did not contain a variant in NOTCH3, indicating that there are other genes or genetic variants contributing to disease in these patients."
neuro,"Finding new biomolecules to target upstream signaling in neurological disorders is a state-of-the-art research strategy. Axon guidance molecules (AGMs) play vital roles in development; however, evidence suggests that these molecules are involved in the pathogenesis of several neurological diseases. Recent studies have shown that repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMa), a member of AGMs, can be targeted as a novel therapeutic option. This molecule has been implicated in several diseases, and inhibiting it improves the outcomes. For example, in various pathological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, optic nerve crush model, focal cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and vascular dementia the expression of RGMa is significantly elevated. RGMa has been detected on amyloid plaques and in the glial scar in brains impacted by Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, RGMa is elevated by activated astrocytes after exposure to TGFbeta. Since the role of RGMa in the development of neurological disorders is crucial, inhibiting RGMa can lead to positive outcomes such as axonal regeneration, neuronal repair, and behavioral improvement. Our review explores the impact of RGMa and outlines the positive results achieved by targeting it in preclinical studies. Based on this information, it is clear that RGMa has significant potential as both a predictive biomarker and a therapeutic option."
infection,"BACKGROUND: Human movement plays a critical role in the transmission of infectious diseases, especially those with environmental drivers like leptospirosis-a zoonotic bacterial infection linked to mud and water contact. Using GPS loggers, we collected detailed telemetry data to understand how fine-scale movements can be analysed in the context of an infectious disease. METHODS: We recruited individuals living in urban slums in Salvador, Brazil, to analyse how they interact with environmental risk factors such as domestic rubbish piles, open sewers, and a local stream. We aimed to identify differences in movement patterns inside the study areas by gender, age, and leptospirosis serological status. Step selection functions, a spatio-temporal model used in animal movement ecology, estimated selection coefficients to represent the likelihood of movement toward specific environmental factors. RESULTS: With 128 participants wearing GPS devices for 24-48 hr, recording locations every 35 s during active daytime hours, we segmented movements into morning, midday, afternoon, and evening. Our results suggested women moved closer to the central stream and farther from open sewers compared to men, while serologically positive individuals avoided open sewers. CONCLUSIONS: This study introduces a novel method for analysing human telemetry data in infectious disease research.

infection,"AIMS: To systematically examine how structural vulnerability has been defined and operationalised in United States-based health research, identify conceptual consistencies and methodological gaps, and propose core dimensions of structural vulnerability along with implications for future application in health research. DESIGN: A systematic mixed-studies review using a parallel-results convergent synthesis design. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, Scopus and CINAHL were searched from first publication through 2024 using the terms 'structural* vulnerab*' AND health. REVIEW METHODS: Peer-reviewed English-language empirical studies conducted in the United States that applied the concept of structural vulnerability were identified. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess study quality. Study content was analysed to identify how structural vulnerability was defined and operationalised. RESULTS: Thirty-seven predominantly high-quality studies published between 2011 and 2024 met inclusion criteria. Structural vulnerability was consistently defined through two interrelated dimensions: as a social positionality (characterised by constrained resilience, limited agency and imposed risks rooted in systemic discrimination and social hierarchies) and as a critical analytic framework for examining structural determinants of health. Quantitative studies predominantly used individual-level indicators (e.g., income, housing) and cross-sectional designs. Qualitative studies focused on experiences of structural vulnerability in relation to health outcomes and infrequently translated findings into structural interventions. The most frequently studied outcomes were infectious disease, substance use and mental health. CONCLUSION: Structural vulnerability, as a conceptual and empirical lens, reveals how systems produce-and can potentially reduce-health risks. Findings underscore the need for geographically diverse and longitudinal studies, as well as multidimensional measures. Advancing health equity demands critiquing systemic causes of inequities and pursuing justice-oriented interventions. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION: Nursing, positioned at the intersection of public health, social sciences and policy, is uniquely equipped to engage structural vulnerability as a critical analytic tool to address health inequities, design interventions and advocate for policy reform. IMPACT: What problem did the study address? This study addressed a lack of clarity in the definition and operationalization of structural vulnerability in health research. What were the main findings? The definition of structural vulnerability is consistent across quantitative and qualitative studies, but there are marked variations in its operationalization. Quantitative studies predominantly rely on individual-level indicators, while qualitative studies use it as a theoretical framework to guide analysis, interpret findings and examine structural determinants of health. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? This review offers a clear framing for integrating structural vulnerability in health research in efforts to advance health equity. REPORTING METHOD: PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) reporting guideline. NO PATIENT OR PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT: This study did not include patient or public involvement in its design, conduct or reporting."
infection,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between neuroticism, coping styles, job satisfaction and burnout among physicians in Gansu Province's infectious disease sentinel medical institutions. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using the Minnesota Satisfaction Scale short-form scale, Coping Style Scale, Burnout Scale, and Chinese Big Five Personality Questionnaire short-form scale on 8,071 physicians in all infectious disease sentinel medical institutions in Gansu Province. RESULTS: There was a correlation between job satisfaction and burnout, coping styles, and neuroticism among doctors in Gansu Province infectious disease designated medical institutions (p < 0.05). Coping style mediated the relationship between job satisfaction and burnout. Neuroticism moderated the relationship between job satisfaction and burnout (t = -3.231, p < 0.05); neuroticism moderated the relationship between job satisfaction and positive coping (t = -10.927, p < 0.05); neuroticism moderated the relationship between positive coping and burnout (t = 4.097, p < 0.05); neurotic personality moderated the relationship between negative coping and burnout (t = -2.710, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Job satisfaction influences burnout among physicians in an infectious disease sentinel care facility through the mediating role of coping styles and the moderating role of neurotic personality."
infection,"INTRODUCTION: toxoplasmosis is an infectious disease caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite capable of infecting all warm-blooded animals, including humans. If the infection is contracted during pregnancy, the parasite can be transmitted to the fetus, potentially leading to congenital anomalies. The present paper aimed to assess the level of awareness and knowledge of pregnant women regarding this disease, and to identify barriers to screening for toxoplasmosis during pregnancy in the province of Beni-Mellal, central Morocco. METHODS: a cross-sectional study was conducted from 21st April to 14th July 2021, at the level of urban and rural health centers as well as the Regional Hospital in Beni-Mellal region, Morocco. A total of 412 questionnaires were completed by pregnant (64.6%) and post-partum women (35.4%). RESULTS: only 27.2% of the women surveyed had received any information about toxoplasmosis. We found a significant association (P<0.05) between knowledge of toxoplasmosis and the woman's residence (urban or rural), profession, education level, and status (pregnant or postpartum). Regarding toxoplasmosis serology, 21.9% of the women were completely unaware of the existence of a toxoplasmosis test. Furthermore, 19.7% cited a lack of financial means as a barrier to testing, and 9.8% attributed the lack of information to healthcare providers' omission to clarify Toxoplasmosis and its consequences. CONCLUSION: this study highlights the pivotal role of effective communication in behavioral change. Therefore, it is crucial to implement an educational program targeting women of childbearing age about toxoplasmosis. Alongside this, ensuring free access to Toxoplasma serology testing is essential."
infection,"INTRODUCTION: Severe infections and sepsis significantly impact military operational readiness and costs through loss of duty days, high treatment rates, and medical evacuations. Early diagnosis is critical for preventing sepsis progression and mortality, but it requires validated biomarkers to guide clinical decision-making. Study protocols for host biomarker discovery in infections usually require inactivation of high-risk pathogens prior to sample analysis, which limits the utility of metabolomics assays designed for untreated samples. METHODS: Matched blood plasma aliquots obtained from an international, observational sepsis cohort were analyzed to quantify metabolites following the commercial AbsoluteIDQ p180 protocol, with and without the addition of an organic solvent extraction method for metabolites, proteins, and lipids (MPLEx), previously validated for inactivating BSL-3/4 pathogens. We evaluated analyte detection rates and concentrations for each method, as well as differences in extraction efficiency. RESULTS: Levels of agreement between the unmodified AbsoluteIDQ p180 and combined MPLEx-p180 methods varied by metabolite class. Most targeted amino acids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and monosaccharides were reliably measured and correlated well between methods. However, the higher sample dilution in the MPLEx-p180 method significantly reduced detection rates for biogenic amines and acylcarnitines, and overall extraction efficiencies also differed. CONCLUSIONS: This study extends the applicability of commercial metabolomics assays designed for untreated samples by improving their suitability for high-risk infectious disease studies. Differences in metabolite extraction efficiencies and detection rates, as well as data harmonization strategies, should be considered if results from both protocols are to be combined."
infection,"Pulmonary tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains one of the leading causes of infectious disease-related mortality worldwide. In parallel, lung cancer represents the most lethal neoplasm, with high mortality rates globally. Emerging studies suggest that chronic Mtb infection may contribute to the development of lung cancer, particularly adenocarcinoma. Several biological mechanisms support this hypothesis. Chronic inflammation from tuberculosis creates a microenvironment enriched in proinflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and growth factors that favor cell proliferation, genomic instability, angiogenesis, and immune evasion, which are considered classic hallmarks of cancer. Additionally, both protein and non-protein virulence factors of Mtb have been shown to interfere with critical cellular signaling pathways related to tumor cell survival and invasion. Clinically, multiple observational studies and meta-analyses report an increased incidence of lung cancer among individuals with a history of tuberculosis, especially when both conditions coexist in the same pulmonary regions. Specific mutations, including EGFR, have been identified in patients with prior tuberculosis, influencing both prognosis and therapeutic response. Nevertheless, key questions remain regarding the causal nature of this association, the role of Mtb strains, and the molecular factors such as epigenetic modifications or the lung microbiome. This review proposes that infection with Mtb could function as a carcinogenic agent. Further in vitro experiments, cellular models, and clinical investigations are urgently needed to support potential reclassification of this pathogen by international agencies such as the IARC."
infection,"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare, life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome caused by uncontrolled activation of T-lymphocytes and macrophages. It is classified as either familial (genetic) or acquired. Among acquired forms, infections are a common trigger, with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and associated opportunistic infections frequently considered in the differential diagnosis. We report the case of a 20-year-old Hispanic male who presented with nausea and vomiting and was found to have bi-cytopenia, high ferritin level, mild splenomegaly, decreased natural killer (NK) cells, and bone marrow findings consistent with HLH. He was also diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, which was considered the underlying trigger for HLH, and was initiated on dexamethasone per HLH-2004 protocol. The patient was started on intravenous amphotericin B for disseminated histoplasmosis, along with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis. Due to worsening mental status, increased amphotericin B and TMP-SMX dose for presumed central nervous system (CNS) histoplasmosis and toxoplasmosis, respectively. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple ring-enhancing lesions, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was positive for Toxoplasma gondii. Amphotericin B was subsequently de-escalated, while TMP-SMX was continued at therapeutic dosing. The patient was co-managed in a multidisciplinary approach involving infectious disease, hematology, and neurology specialists. We conclude that early diagnosis of HLH is critical to prevent disease progression and improve patient outcomes. Identifying and treating the underlying trigger remains the cornerstone of effective management. The use of timely diagnostic tools and a multidisciplinary approach is essential to avoid delays in recognizing HLH and initiating appropriate therapy."
infection,"Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common acute infectious disease in children caused by various enteroviruses (EV). CV-A16 is one of the main pathogens of HFMD, leading to multiple outbreaks of HFMD worldwide, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. This study aims to investigate the molecular epidemiological characteristics of the coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) that cause HFMD in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province from 2021 to 2024. A total of 2,105-laboratory diagnosis HFMD cases were collected, of which 529 were CV-A16 positive samples. The detected number of CV-A16 began to rise in March, peaked in May-August, and then decreased in September. Its distribution was highest in children aged 1-5 years, with more males than females. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the B1a and B1b subgenotypes were simultaneously prevalent in Hangzhou from 2021 to 2023. The B1c evolutionary branch detected in Hangzhou in 2023 experienced a sudden increase in quantity in 2024, with the same proportion as B1a, suggesting a change in the subgenotype prevalence of CV-A16 virus. Evolutionary analysis also confirmed that the CV-A16 in Hangzhou is genetically stable and the B1a lineage emerged earlier, followed by B1b, while B1c is a newly emerging lineage. There were three specific amino acid variations (P3S, I235V, and T240A) in the VP1 sequence of B1c. These findings have expanded the global genetic resources of CVA16 and provided supporting evidence for the prevention and control of HFMD. Meanwhile, the CV-A16 B1c outbreak branch that emerged in Hangzhou from 2023 to 2024 also highlights the necessity of strengthening the monitoring of virus evolution and epidemiological dynamics in this region."
infection,"Malaria remains a significant public health problem, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where its burden remains a concern despite existing control measures. Recent advances in vaccination, particularly with RTS, S and R21, offer new opportunities to mitigate malaria transmission and disease severity. In this study, we develop an age-structured mathematical model to assess the combined effects of vaccination and non-vaccine interventions on malaria transmission dynamics. The model integrates demographic parameters, long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLIN), access to treatment for clinical cases, vaccine efficacy profiles, and waning immunity to simulate disease burden in age cohorts over a long-term period. Our approach enables a comparative assessment of projected malaria transmission rates, disease burden, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) under different vaccination scenarios. For application purposes, the model is calibrated using national-level demographic data for a low transmission setting (Ethiopia) and a high transmission setting (Nigeria). Preliminary findings suggest that the integration of vaccination with existing malaria control strategies could significantly reduce malaria incidence and mortality over time. This study provides valuable insights into optimizing vaccination strategies and guiding public health policies aimed at long-term malaria control in endemic regions."
infection,"INTRODUCTION: Infectious mononucleosis (IM), most commonly caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), classically presents with fever, pharyngitis, and cervical lymphadenopathy. However, less common manifestations such as bilateral periorbital edema, known as Hoagland sign, may precede or obscure more typical features, complicating diagnosis. Although described in the literature for decades, Hoagland sign remains underrecognized in clinical practice, especially in pediatric and young adult patients. This oversight can lead to misdiagnosis, delayed testing, unnecessary antibiotic use, and patient distress. CASE PRESENTATION: We present 2 cases of female patients, one pediatric and one young adult, who initially presented with bilateral periorbital edema and nonspecific systemic symptoms. In both cases, infectious mononucleosis was not initially suspected. One patient was treated for streptococcal pharyngitis and later developed a rash typical of antibiotic-associated IM. The second patient was denied EBV testing at an urgent care clinic despite a direct request, due to provider unfamiliarity with the association between periorbital edema and IM. Both were eventually diagnosed with EBV via serologic testing and recovered with supportive care. CONCLUSION: These cases highlight a critical gap in provider awareness that, if addressed, could reduce diagnostic delays and improve patient care. Recognizing Hoagland sign as a valid early clue for IM, particularly in female patients,can help differentiate benign viral illness from more concerning differentials such as orbital cellulitis, nephrotic syndrome, or allergic reactions. This report serves as a clinical reminder to include EBV in the differential diagnosis of atraumatic, bilateral eyelid swelling and to educate frontline providers on this underappreciated presentation."
infection,"This study examined the impacts of Sophora alopecuroides supplementation on growth performance, nitrogen (N) and energy utilization, methane (CH(4)) emissions, serum indices, rumen fermentation, and bacterial community in Simmental cattle. Twenty-four 6-month-old male Simmental cattle (170.00 +/- 1.07 kg) were randomly assigned to 4 treatments: control (basal diet, 0 mg/kg group) and basal diet with 150, 300, or 450 mg/kg body weight (BW) of S. alopecuroides supplementation. The 74-d trial included a 14-d adaptation and a 60-day experimental phase. Results showed that S. alopecuroides supplementation quadratically increased dry matter intake (DMI), average daily gain (ADG) and final BW (P < 0.05), while reducing feed conversion ratio (FCR) (P = 0.001). S. alopecuroides supplementation also quadratically increased the apparent digestibility of DM, organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) (P < 0.05). Additionally, supplementation at 300 mg/kg reduced urinary N excretion and improved retained N, compared to the 0 mg/kg group (P < 0.05). S. alopecuroides supplementation quadratically enhanced gross energy intake (GEI) and energy balance (EB) (P < 0.05), while tended to quadratically increase digestible energy intake (DEI; P = 0.064), and metabolic energy intake (MEI; P = 0.087). Furthermore, the content of serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were quadratically enhanced by S. alopecuroides supplementation (P < 0.05). Moreover, S. alopecuroides supplementation linearly increased the proportion of acetate in the rumen (P = 0.028), with trends towards a higher acetate/propionate ratio (P = 0.083) and lower concentration of propionate (P = 0.086). Alpha diversity indices (Chao1) were higher in the 300 mg/kg group than in the 0 mg/kg group (P < 0.05). Rikenellaceae RC9-gut group and Ruminococcaceae NK4A214 group were significantly increased in the 300 mg/kg group, and positively correlated with EB (P < 0.05); while WCHB1-41 was decreased in the 150 and 300 mg/kg group, and positively correlated with UE and urinary N excretion (P < 0.05). The functional prediction results indicated that the pathways related to 'Xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism', 'Biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites', and 'Infectious disease: bacterial' were significantly enriched in the 450 mg/kg group, while 'Pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis', 'C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism', and 'Valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis' were significantly enriched in the 300 mg/kg group (P < 0.05). Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that S. alopecuroides supplementation at 450 mg/kg reduced the complexity and stability of the rumen bacteria network. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with S. alopecuroides at 300 mg/kg improved the growth performance of Simmental cattle by enhancing nutrient digestibility, N utilization, energy metabolism, and serum antioxidant levels. Excessive levels (450 mg/kg) negatively impacted the complexity and stability of the rumen bacteria community. These findings suggest that while S. alopecuroides can be beneficial at optimal levels, careful dose management is essential to avoid adverse effects on rumen microbiota and overall animal health."
infection,"Influenza type A viruses (IAVs) remain an extraordinary burden to global public health and regularly circulate through human populations. This investigation describes the isolation of human mAbs from an individual with a substantial history of influenza exposure via vaccination and natural infection. From these mAbs, a clonally expanded B cell lineage was identified that recognizes the IAV neuraminidase (NA) glycoprotein and binds near the NA active site of H3N2 viruses to inhibit sialidase activity. Further characterization found that some somatically mutated members of this lineage exhibited cross-reactive binding to recombinant N1 and N9 antigens, suggesting that heterosubtypic reactivity was acquired through somatic mutation. Two candidate mAbs from this family - FluA-168 and FluA-173 - potently inhibited IAV replication in vitro and protected against lethality in vivo. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of cross-reactivity between IAV subtypes in response to diverse exposure patterns and identified 2 mAbs as potential therapeutic candidates for IAV infection."
infection,"A 34-year-old lactating woman presented with erythematous indurated plaques around the perioral region, extending to the nose and forehead, mimicking granulomatous dermatoses. Dermoscopy showed follicular plugging and dermal inflammation. Histopathology revealed epithelioid cell granulomas with giant cells and nerve infiltration, confirming borderline tuberculoid leprosy. The patient was treated with multidrug therapy and closely monitored for reactions. This case underscores the diagnostic challenge of Hansen's disease with atypical centrofacial presentation and emphasizes the importance of histopathological confirmation for timely treatment, particularly in vulnerable groups such as lactating mothers."
infection,"Hydatid cyst is an infectious disease that occurs in humans due to infection of Echinococcus granulosus larvae. Although cardiac hydatid cysts are rare, right atrial localisation is even rarer. The aim of this article is to emphasise the importance of always being alert and prepared for the risk of anaphylaxis developing due to cyst rupture in paediatric patients with isolated cardiac hydatid cysts, to initiate oral albendazole treatment immediately upon diagnosis, to underline the importance of surgical timing, and to discuss the role of clinical assessment and imaging methods in predicting of cyst rupture."
infection,"OBJECTIVES: Hierarchical composite endpoints (HCEs) are increasingly being used in infectious disease research. In this paper, we illustrate different methods for analyzing HCEs in post-hoc analyses of the BALANCE and CAMERA2 clinical trials. METHODS: We constructed post-hoc HCEs for each trial by combining clinical efficacy and safety outcomes: (a) mortality, relapse of bacteremia, and antibiotic adverse events for BALANCE, and (b) mortality, primary treatment failure, infectious complications, and antibiotic adverse events for CAMERA2. For both trials, we additionally included length of stay (LOS) or duration of antibiotic treatment as tiebreakers after the primary HCE in separate analyses. We applied these analytic methods: (a) logistic regression using a binary composite outcome, (b) generalized pairwise comparisons using different outcome permutations, (c) Wilcoxon rank-sum approach for an ordinal outcome, (d) proportional odds model, and (e) probabilistic index model. We estimated the probabilistic index, win ratio, win odds, net treatment benefit, or odds ratio where possible using each method. RESULTS: For the BALANCE trial, all analyses of the primary HCE resulted in the same conclusion of no evidence of differences between treatment groups. Inclusion of LOS as a tiebreaker resulted in 7 of 11 analyses finding the 7-day treatment arm superior to the 14-day arm, while inclusion of antibiotic duration resulted in all analyses concluding superiority of the 7-day treatment arm. For the CAMERA2 trial, all analyses found no evidence of differences between the two treatment groups. For all analyses, there were only minor differences in estimates across different analytic methods. CONCLUSIONS: In these post-hoc analyses, different methods for analyzing HCEs resulted in similar effect estimates and conclusions consistent with the primary analyses of the BALANCE and CAMERA2 trials. These analyses illustrate how different HCEs can be constructed and analyzed, and may be useful to other researchers in designing future studies that use HCEs."
infection,"Glass capillary nanopores have been widely used for resistive pulse sensing and ionic current rectification-based nanopore sensing due to their excellent mechanical properties, simple fabrication, easy surface modification, and low production cost. These nanopores have demonstrated great potential in detecting diverse biomarkers, including nucleic acids, proteins, cell vesicles, viruses, and bacteria. Here, we highlight recent advances in molecular diagnostics using glass capillary nanopores, especially focusing on the detection of infectious disease pathogens and cancer-associated microRNAs. By integrating precisely sized glass nanopipette-based nanopores with nucleic acid amplification techniques and well-designed probes, this sensing platform has emerged as a promising method for liquid biopsy from patient body fluids. In consideration of recent research on molecular diagnostics and the difficulties with glass capillary nanopipettes, we also discuss the future direction of molecular diagnostics using this tool."
infection,"BACKGROUND: Hospitals play a crucial role in disaster response, but they often face resource challenges. Hospital disaster preparedness, involving plans and procedures, is vital to ensure they can handle emergencies effectively. Nepal has identified 25 Hub Hospitals to coordinate disaster response, highlighting the importance of organized disaster management planning in saving lives. This study assesses disaster preparedness in these designated hospitals. METHODS: This observational study conducted in December 2023 is a secondary analysis of data from a workshop held in 25 designated hub hospitals in Nepal. The workshop aimed to develop disaster preparedness plans. The study evaluates physical facilities, triage, planning, and available resources in these hospitals, categorizing variables related to beds, human resources, disaster plans, and more. Ethical approval was obtained. RESULTS: Average hospital bed occupancy in ward was 80% and that of emergency was 92%. The average bed per province was 1272, nurses were 833, doctors were 521, paramedics were 181. Disaster plan was available in 21(84%) of the hospital. Out of 21 hospitals that had disaster plan, surge capacity activation plan was included in 18(86%), infectious disease outbreak plan in 14(67%) and fire safety plan in 7(33%) of the disaster plan. Blood bank was available in 16(64%) of the hospitals. One stop crisis management Centre was available in in 24(96%) hub hospitals, birthing and facility for caesarean section was available in all hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings reveal varying levels of hospital preparedness in Nepal, including bed occupancy, staff, disaster plans, structural assessments, and available services."
infection,"Melioidosis, an emerging tropical infectious disease and a global threat, lacks a disease prediction model owing to the limited data on case incidences and associated factors. This article focuses on spatial data analysis of melioidosis patients in India, a tropical country considered to be endemic for the disease, to identify gaps in disease reporting. In this study, we screened over 20,000 articles and identified 1,694 patients diagnosed with melioidosis in India between 1953 and 2023. We performed a correlative analysis of patient profiles, case-reporting centres, common misdiagnosed etiologies, susceptible populations, agrometeorological and socioeconomic factors. Our findings suggest that melioidosis can affect individuals of all ages, with a higher prevalence among farmers and individuals with diabetes mellitus, especially adults aged 40-55 years. Most cases are reported during the monsoon season (June to September). Numerous favorable conditions for Burkholderia pseudomallei growth exist across India. However, most reported cases are from the south, suggesting under-reporting, under-diagnosis, or misdiagnosis. A ""Melioidosis Checklist Index"" has been developed as a surveillance tool to enhance case reporting. The melioidosis checklist index combines patient demographics, clinical symptoms, medical and family history, exposure risks, occupation, travel history, and lifestyle factors to assess infection likelihood. Probability scores derived from these parameters provide a structured aid for early diagnosis and case reporting. The study also highlighted the need to enhance regional data collection by raising awareness among vulnerable populations, healthcare providers, and paramedical staff through government initiatives."
infection,"BACKGROUND: Central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) are associated with increased mortality and healthcare costs. We describe implementing a hospital-wide business intelligence (BI) system coupled with infectious disease (ID) specialist intervention to support proactive CRBSI surveillance. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective analysis of a quality improvement initiative from January 2019 to September 2024. A BI system used predefined criteria (leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein, prolonged catheter duration, and fever) to identify high-risk patients. Starting in July 2022, ID specialists reviewed these cases and provided advice on catheter reassessment. We employed interrupted time series (ITS) analysis to evaluate quarterly trends in CRBSI incidence and mean central venous catheter (CVC) duration, adjusting for seasonality and conducting a stratified analysis for ICU versus non-ICU settings. RESULTS: A total of 5090 patients with 6,750 CVC placements were included. While the overall trend for CRBSI incidence was not significantly affected by the intervention, the stratified analysis showed a statistically significant decrease in the CRBSI incidence trend within the ICU setting (slope change Delta = - 0.737/quarter, P = 0.045). No significant change was seen in the non-ICU setting. The intervention's effect on average CVC duration was less evident, with varied and often non-significant changes across different sites. CONCLUSION: A hospital-wide BI system, combined with ID specialist expertise, was associated with a significant reduction in CRBSI incidence over time, especially in the high-risk ICU setting. This technology-focused, expert-supported approach offers a promising approach to improving patient safety and infection control outcomes."
infection,"Zoonotic disease dynamics (ZDD), encompassing pathogen spillover, transmission pathways and host-pathogen interactions, are widely acknowledged as drivers of emerging infectious diseases. Yet, the extent to which recent pandemic prevention, preparedness and response (PPPR) policies - the integrated frameworks guiding international efforts to anticipate and manage infectious disease threats - are grounded in this expanding body of scientific research remains unclear. This study examines how research on ZDD is cited in six influential global policy reports published between 2021 and 2023. We employed citation network analysis and qualitative profiling to compare references cited in these reports with those cited by a systematically identified set of broad-scope scientific publications on ZDD. Of the 313 references across the six reports, only 59 (19%) pertained to ZDD, a relatively small proportion considering that zoonotic diseases are framed as primary drivers of pandemic risk in these same reports. The academic literature is highly diverse and predominantly focused on specific pathogens (66%), with few studies offering a broad-scope perspective (4%) that addresses the complexity of ZDD. The citation network of the selected broad-scope literature was fragmented revealing low convergence of the knowledge base. Shared references between reports and scientific literature (n = 31) were mostly modelling studies (45%) or reviews (35%). Secondary data predominated (45%), and only 6% relied primarily on original field or laboratory data. Foundational studies were often overrepresented. This narrow and selective evidence base risks obscuring key uncertainties and limiting the diversity of perspectives that inform global PPPR strategies. Our findings highlight the value of more systematic approaches to scientific evidence use in PPPR policy documents. Strengthening the science-policy interface in PPPR requires greater engagement with emerging research, epistemic diversity, and the acknowledgment of uncertainty - essential steps toward building more adaptive, equitable and resilient strategies."
infection,"BACKGROUND Type II cryoglobulinemic vasculitis is a systemic syndrome that usually develops in the background of chronic HCV infection. Cases of non-hepatitis C (HCV)-related type II cryoglobulinemic vasculitis pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in patients with pre-existing hematologic and rheumatic conditions. CASE REPORT We present the case of an 82-year-old woman with a history of skin-limited hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (HUV), monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS), and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), with new-onset pericarditis, pleuritis, worsening rash, and acute kidney injury. Skin and renal biopsies confirmed a diagnosis of type II (mixed) cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. After an extensive infectious disease workup and an in-depth investigation on our patient's MGUS and MBL, none of the classic causative factors for non-infectious mixed-type cryoglobulinemia were identified. Ultimately, she was started on immunosuppressive treatment, despite which she experienced rapidly progressive disease with pulmonary involvement. Utilizing this case as a basis, we examine the challenges of treating non-HCV-related cryoglobulinemia in patients with complex medical histories. CONCLUSIONS We report a case of mixed cryoglobulinemia in the absence of infection and the presence of 2 premalignant hematologic disorders. Moreover, this case emphasizes the importance of conducting biopsies to differentiate between vasculitis syndromes with overlapping phenotypes, illustrates the diagnostic challenges of recognizing cryoglobulinemia in a timely fashion in patients with pre-existing hematologic and autoimmune comorbidities, and highlights the need for better prognostic and diagnostic methods."
infection,"BACKGROUND: Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) was an acute infectious disease. This study aimed to estimate the development trend of HFMD. METHODS: The incidence surveillance data of HFMD from 2005 to 2019 mainly came from the Public Health Sciences Data Center of China. Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model was compared with other models to evaluate the accuracy of the incidence of HFMD and to predict its incidence up to 2030. RESULTS: A total of 22,559,406 cases of HFMD were reported. The test results showed that BAPC model may be better than Auto-regressive integrated moving average (Auto_arima), Exponential smoothing (ETS), Prophet and Earth models on mean absolute error (MAE), symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE), mean square error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE) indicators. From 2005 to 2019, there was a trend toward increasing HFMD incidence (Average Annual Percent Change (AAPC) = 45.9, 95% CI 15.5, 84.3, p < 0.1) by joinpoint regression analysis. But BAPC model showed that the annual reported incidence of HFMD in mainland China appeared to be on a downward trend by 2030 (954,069.79 cases, 67.3966 cases per 100,000). Spatial-temporal aggregation analysis detected four high-risk areas of a ""most likely"" cluster (southern central region), a secondary cluster (eastern region) and two tertiary clusters (northern region, southwestern region). CONCLUSIONS: It was important to protect the population, especially children in high-risk areas of HFMD. In high Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita areas, especially urban areas, health departments should advise to reduce gathering activities that may cause the spread of HFMD. In areas such as train stations, bus stations, and airports with more floating population, health department should advise travelers not to stay in these areas for a long time."
infection,"Arthropods are ancient vectors of infectious disease that alter the immune environment of the skin during feeding. The epidermis and its immune sentinels, including Langerhans cells, are critical for protection against ectoparasitic arthropods such as ticks. Here, we investigate how human Langerhans cells respond to clinical and experimental tick bites and concomitant infection with the tick-borne bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. Using imaging, migration assays, immune spheroid models, and single-cell transcriptomic analysis of patient samples, we show that tick bites and tick saliva reprogram Langerhans cells to increase migration into lymphatic tissues, adopt a tolerogenic state marked by specific transcriptional programs, reduced ability to induce pro-inflammatory helper T cells, and enhanced promotion of type 2 and regulatory T cell responses. This shift dampens protective immunity and helps explain how ticks and their pathogens evade host defense and achieve efficient transmission."
infection,"Melioidosis, an infectious disease caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, poses significant public health challenges, particularly in regions where specific environmental factors play crucial roles in its spread. However, traditional risk assessment methods for melioidosis do not comprehensively incorporate the diverse environmental factors that influence the distribution of this bacteria. This paper presents a spatiotemporal analysis of melioidosis transmission in Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand, through a comparative evaluation of extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and TabNet models. To model the disease distribution over spatiotemporal scales, various environmental datasets were integrated, including land surface temperature, normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference water index, and rainfall data. The models were trained and validated on data spanning from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2022, which were obtained from 219 subdistricts. Our comparative analysis of the two models showed that TabNet outperformed XGBoost, particularly in capturing complex interactions between environmental variables and melioidosis cases, and achieved a higher accuracy score (0.950 for TabNet versus 0.892 for XGBoost). While both models performed similarly in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, TabNet exhibited marginally more variability. These results underscore the importance of environmental data for refining predictive models that are used for melioidosis surveillance and management."
infection,"Splenomegaly with diffuse heterogeneous parenchyma was detected in a 6-year-old female Lagotto Romagnolo from Germany during routine ultrasonographic examination. The cytologic examination of a fine needle aspirate of the spleen revealed reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and extramedullary hematopoiesis. During diagnostic workup, babesiosis with high Babesia antibody levels and evidence of Babesia canis was diagnosed as the cause of the splenic parenchymal findings. At no time, the dog showed any clinical signs or clinicopathologic findings associated with the infection, although active babesiosis was diagnosed. Due to the high antibody level, it can be postulated that the dog had already been exposed to the pathogen at an earlier stage or that she had a subacute course of the disease.To the authors' knowledge, this is one of the few descriptions of babesiosis with structural splenopathy with evidence of extramedullary hematopoiesis as the only indication of the presence of the infectious disease and without corresponding clinicopathologic findings."
infection,"A central signal that marshals host defense against many infections is the lymphocyte-derived cytokine interferon-gamma (IFNgamma). The IFNgamma receptor is expressed on most human cells, and its activation leads to the expression of antimicrobial proteins that execute diverse cell-autonomous immune programs. One such immune program consists of the sequential detection, ubiquitylation, and destruction of intracellular pathogens. Recently, the IFNgamma-inducible ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF213 was identified as a pivotal mediator of such a defense axis. RNF213 provides host protection against viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens. To establish infections, potentially susceptible intracellular pathogens must have evolved mechanisms that subdue RNF213-controlled cell-autonomous immunity. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate here that a causative agent of bacillary dysentery, Shigella flexneri, uses the type III secretion system (T3SS) effector IpaH1.4 to induce the degradation of RNF213. S. flexneri mutants lacking IpaH1.4 expression are bound and ubiquitylated by RNF213 in the cytosol of IFNgamma-primed host cells. Linear (M1-) and lysine-linked ubiquitylation of S. flexneri requires RNF213 but is independent of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC). We find that ubiquitylation of S. flexneri is insufficient to kill intracellular bacteria, suggesting that S. flexneri employs additional virulence factors to escape from host defenses that operate downstream from RNF213-driven ubiquitylation. In brief, this study identified the bacterial IpaH1.4 protein as an inhibitor of mammalian RNF213 and highlights evasion of RNF213-driven immunity as a characteristic of the human-tropic pathogen Shigella."
diabetes,"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) represent a severe complication of diabetes mellitus, leading to significant morbidity, amputation risk, and healthcare burden. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between circulating ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) levels and DFU. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central and Google Scholar databases was conducted to identify eligible observational studies reporting IMA concentrations in DFU patients, diabetics without foot ulcers, and healthy controls. Meta-analyses were performed using both frequentist random-effects models and Bayesian approaches. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to express continuous outcomes. PET-PEESE regression analyses assessed publication bias and small-study effects. A total of six studies were included, with five eligible for meta-analysis. Compared to healthy controls, DFU patients exhibited significantly higher IMA levels [pooled SMD = 3.21 (95% CI: 1.40, 5.03)]. Similarly, DFU patients had higher IMA levels than diabetics without foot ulcers [pooled SMD = 1.21 (95% CI: 0.23, 2.20)]. Both frequentist and Bayesian analyses consistently supported these findings despite notable heterogeneity. Adjusted analyses of IMA for serum albumin further confirmed its discriminative value in DFU. PET-PEESE analyses did not detect significant publication bias. This meta-analysis highlights the potential of IMA as a biomarker for diagnosis, risk stratification, and monitoring in DFU management. Despite significant associations, high inter-study heterogeneity and the limited number of studies restrict generalizability. Future research should focus on standardizing measurement protocols, validating clinical cut-offs, and conducting large-scale prospective studies to confirm its utility."
diabetes,"Background To investigate a potential association of Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-determined classical and endogen type of coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) and cardiovascular outcome in cardio-metabolic disease.Methods We consecutively enrolled 287 symptomatic patients with normal pharmacological stress and rest myocardial perfusion on (13)N-ammonia PET/CT. (13)N-ammonia PET/CT concurrently assessed myocardial flow reserve (MFR). normal coronary microvascular function (nCMF) was defined by a MFR of >/= 2.0, while an abnormal MFR of < 2.0 signified CMD. Patients were then sub-grouped nCMF with classical type (group 1) or endogen type (group 2) and CMD with classical type (group 3) and endogen type (group 4), respectively. Major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting, or ischemic stroke) were assessed as clinical outcome parameters over a mean follow-up of 2.52 +/- 1.31years.Results During follow-up, 15 of 287 patients (5%) suffered cardiovascular events. Six of the group 1 patients developed a cerebral stroke. In group 2, 3, and 4, cardiovascular events occurred in 0, 8 (four cardiovascular death, three coronary angioplasty), and 1 (one ischemic) patient, respectively (p </= 0.0001, univariate by log-rank test). Patients in group 3 demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of cardiovascular events compared to group 1, 2 and 4, respectively (p = 0.004, log-rank test). On multivariate analysis, only diabetes mellitus remained independently associated with cardiovascular events (p < 0.0001, multivariate by Cox regression model).Conclusions The classical but not necessarily the endogen type of CMD is potentially associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular events in a cardiometabolic disease population.

diabetes,"BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a prevalent metabolic disorder in pregnant women, marked by hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance that initially appears during pregnancy. It presents serious health concerns to both the mother and the foetus, increasing the likelihood of complications such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, and fetal macrosomia. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial for minimizing these risks. However, current screening methods for GDM, such as the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), are typically administered between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation, leaving a substantial window during which metabolic changes may already be affecting maternal and fetal outcomes. We hypothesized that the serum metabolomics analysis may serve as a potential method for the predictive screening of GDM during the first trimester of pregnancy. Within this framework, the present study has been designed to identify distinctive metabolic patterns in the serum samples of pregnant women during the first trimester that are predictive of GDM development later in pregnancy. METHODS: The study involved a cohort of hundred (N = 100) pregnant women in their first trimester were recruited and grouped based on their subsequent development of GDM (referred here as pre-GDM group, N = 29) and non-GDM (i.e. normoglycemic, N = 71). The serum metabolic profiles were measured using 800 MHz NMR spectroscopy and compared using sparse PLS-DA (Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis). RESULTS: The 3D score plot revealed exquisite clustering of pre-GDM subjects and separation from non-GDM group. The performance of sPLS-DA model is validated through cross-validation and the VIP score plot highlighted several key metabolites contributing to the discrimination. Further, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis highlighted their diagnostic potential in distinguishing between the pre-GDM and non-GDM groups. Overall, 15 metabolic features provided a robust foundation for distinguishing between pre-GDM and non-GDM groups, with alanine, myo-inositol, valine and glucose showing the highest diagnostic potential. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that NMR-based serum metabolomics can identify distinctive metabolic signatures during the first trimester that are predictive of subsequent GDM development. These findings suggest the potential of this approach as a supportive tool for early screening and risk stratification in pregnant women, warranting validation in larger, multi-center cohorts."
diabetes,"Diabetes mellitus exacerbates cerebral ischemic damage by potentiating neuroinflammation. We hypothesized that activation of the bradykinin type 2 receptor, a mediator of inflammation and vascular dynamics, might be detrimental to ischemic injury development in diabetic animals. We monitored the acute phase of cerebral ischemia in type 1 diabetic mice, diabetic bradykinin type 2 receptor knock-out mice, and their non-diabetic controls using neurological assessment, magnetic resonance imaging, and a comprehensive immuno-histochemical and morphological analysis to quantify changes in microglial, neutrophil, and neuronal populations. Our findings reveal that bradykinin type 2 receptor deficiency ameliorates neurological deficit in non-diabetic mice, despite similar ischemic lesion volumes across all investigated groups. Furthermore, in non-diabetic animals, the bradykinin type 2 receptor plays a discernible role in edema resolution, neuroprotection, and regulation of microglial response to ischemia. However, diabetes, as a stroke comorbidity, alters the involvement of the bradykinin type 2 receptor in ischemic injury development. Bradykinin type 2 receptor-deficient diabetic animals demonstrate delayed microglial cell loss and reduced microglial reactivity following ischemia compared to diabetic animals with functional bradykinin type 2 receptors. The attenuated immune response is accompanied by a marked absence of infiltrating neutrophils within the ischemic territory and improved neuronal survival. This study demonstrates that diabetes profoundly modifies the role of bradykinin type 2 receptor in cerebral ischemic injury, influencing both acute neuroinflammation and cell survival. These findings support the potential of the bradykinin type 2 receptor as a therapeutic target for stroke in diabetic population, warranting further investigation."
diabetes,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hypertension is the leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Despite multiple antihypertensive therapies, blood pressure (BP) control remains suboptimal in many individuals with persistent cardiovascular risk. This review evaluates the antihypertensive potential of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), particularly in patients with comorbid diabetes, HF, CKD or resistant hypertension. RECENT FINDINGS: SGLT2-i consistently lower office SBP/DBP (2.5-4.0/1.5-2.0 mmHg) and 24-hour ambulatory BP (3.8/1.8 mmHg). GLP-1RAs show modest SBP reductions (1.8-5.1 mmHg) and minimal DBP effects (~ 0.5 mmHg), though tirzepatide shows greater efficacy (~ 10.6 mmHg) in select populations. Both classes have demonstrated cardio-renal benefits, favorable safety profiles, and reduced polypharmacy. SGLT2-i exert more consistent BP-lowering effects than GLP-1RA, largely due to their diuretic-like action. While not first-line therapies, both drug classes show promise as adjuncts in high-risk populations. Future research should further define their role in comprehensive hypertension management."
diabetes,"Diabetes is characterized by increased blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) linked with insufficient insulin secretion or action. Diabetes has become a major health concern in the twenty-first century. Persistent hyperglycemia damages the kidneys, nerves, eyes, and heart. Furthermore, cardiovascular problems such as hypertension, abnormal lipoprotein concentrations, and cerebrovascular disease are more common in diabetic patients. Looking at the limitations of current diabetes treatment and associated complications, such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiomyopathy, the approach of exploring plant bioactive compounds as an alternative therapeutic option has gained prime importance. Gallic acid is one of the important natural products that has been extensively studied for its various pharmacological effects. Emerging evidence suggests gallic acid modulates key pathways involved in glucose metabolism and oxidative stress, offering a multi-targeted approach to mitigate diabetic complications. The present review focuses on scientific studies carried out on gallic acid for its effect on diabetes and diabetic complications."
diabetes,"BACKGROUNDS AND AIMS: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) can result in foot ulcers and ultimately limb amputation. The Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI) is a recommended screening tool for DPN. However, it must be appropriately translated and validated before use in new linguistic and cultural contexts. The study aimed to translate the MNSI into Bangla and assess its validity and applicability among Bangladeshi Diabetic patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to develop Bangla version of the MNSI questionnaire (MNSIq-Bl) following ISPOR Task Force recommendations. The translation process included reconciliation, expert committee review, and pilot testing among 20 purposively selected patients with diagnosed diabetes mellitus. Validation was performed among purposively selected 50 diabetic patients attending outpatient Department of Endocrinology, Dhaka Medical College, adhering to the inclusion and exclusion criteria between July 2018 and June 2019. Cut-off values for the MNSIq-Bl and MNSIe (questionnaire and physical examination) scores were recommended compared with the result of the Nerve Conduction Study (NCS). Ethical clearance (MIU-DMC/ECC/2019/42, dated February 6, 2019) from the due authority and informed written consent were obtained from the respondents before data collection. RESULTS: Strong inter-interviewer reliability was observed for both MNSIq-Bl (r = 0.977) and MNSIe (r = 0.923), with significance at p < 0.001. Cronbach's alpha for MNSIq-Bl (excluding Items 4 and 10) ranged from 0.7 to 0.8, indicating acceptable internal consistency. The area under the curve (AUC) for MNSIq-Bl was 0.850 at a cut-off score of >/= 2.5 with 68% sensitivity and 75% specificity. For MNSIe, the AUC was 0.918 at a cut-off score of >/= 0.5, with 90% sensitivity and 75% specificity. CONCLUSION: The Bangla version of MNSI (MNSI-Bl) is a valid and reliable tool for screening diabetic peripheral neuropathy among Bangla-speaking patients, demonstrating good diagnostic performance."
diabetes,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In Sudan, the prevalence of diabetes was 18.9% in 2021. Diet is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Therefore, this study aimed to assess dietary knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Khartoum state, Sudan. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the period from August 2022 to October 2022 among 365 diabetes patients recruited from four health centers in Khartoum state. A validated questionnaire was used. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. The chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis were used to identify variables that affect the dietary KAP of diabetes patients. RESULTS: The majority of participants had good knowledge (99%), and a positive attitude (99.5%), but poor practice (80%). Female gender, coming from a primary health care center, and practice of physical activity were significantly associated with better practice scores. Cost and difficulty maintaining healthy dietary habits at social events were the major barriers to following dietary recommendations. CONCLUSION: The good knowledge and the positive attitude were not reflected in practice. This is contrary to the international dietary recommendations and reveals hindrances that prevent participants from applying what they know, and what they believe. Therefore, focusing on solving economic difficulties together with the other major barriers should be the attention focus of health care providers in order for the education programs to be effective."
diabetes,"BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a prevalent metabolic disorder associated with pregnancy, which often postpones intervention until after metabolic complications have developed. This study seeks to develop an integrated predictive model that combines first trimester metabolomic signatures with established clinical risk factors to enable the early detection of high-risk pregnancies prior to the onset of irreversible metabolic damages. METHODS: A total of 89 pregnant women [45 with GDM, 44 with normal glucose tolerance (NGT)] was recruited at Hainan Provincial People's Hospital. Serum and urine samples were subjected to untargeted metabolomic profiling employing UPLC-MS/MS. Metabolite identification was conducted using the Human Metabolome Database and Metlin databases. Bioinformatics analyses were performed on the differential metabolites. Lasso regression was employed to select the metabolites and clinical features utilized in constructing the model. The entire dataset was divided into a training set and a validation set in a 7:3 ratio. Six Machine learning models were trained to identify patients with GDM. Model performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), precision, recall, and F1-score. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was used to interpret feature contributions in the optimal model. RESULTS: Cases of GDM demonstrated distinct metabolic profiles in comparison to participants with NGT. A total of 528 differential metabolites were identified, and KEGG pathway analysis mapped these metabolites to 20 pathways related to metabolism and human diseases. Lasso regression identified 11 differential metabolites and 3 clinical features for training the ML models. Ultimately, the multilayer perceptron achieved the highest classification performance, with an AUC of 0.984 (95%CI: 0.866-1.000) in the validation set. SHAP analysis identified GlcCer(d18:1/16:0) and triglycerides as the most significant predictors, demonstrating positive associations with the risk of GDM. CONCLUSION: Participants with GDM and NGT show great difference in the levels of many metabolites. The ML model according to the metabolites in the first trimester and clinical feature demonstrates high accuracy for early GDM prediction. The result of this research highlighted the potential of metabolites in the prediction of GDM in the early stage of pregnancy."
diabetes,"Novel chalcone derivatives incorporating pyrazole moieties were synthesized via microwave assisted Claisen-Schmidt condensation and evaluated for their in vitro alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory potential as therapeutic agents against diabetes mellitus, a rapidly escalating global health crisis. The microwave-assisted approach demonstrated remarkable synthetic advantages achieving excellent yields (80-85%) and enhanced product purity within minutes compared to conventional methods requiring over 24 hours. Five pyrazole-chalcone hybrids, L(I) (C(19)H(16)N(2)O), L(II) (C(18)H(14)Cl(2)N(2)O), L(III) (C(18)H(14)N(3)O(3)), L(IV) (C(20)H(16)N(2)O(2)), and L(V) (C(18)H(15)N(2)O(2)), were successfully synthesized from pyrazole ketone and different substituted aldehydes. Comprehensive structural characterization using FTIR, NMR, UV-Vis, fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, and mass spectrometry confirmed successful target compound formation. In vitro enzyme inhibition studies revealed promising dose dependent activity with compounds L(IV) (IC(50) = 212.5 microM) and L(II) (IC(50) = 215.2 microM) demonstrating superior alpha-glucosidase inhibition compared to acarbose (IC(50) = 240.6 microM), while compound L(I) exhibited potent alpha-amylase inhibitory activity (IC(50) = 501.9 microM). DNA binding studies indicated intercalative interactions with binding constants ranging from 10(3) to 10(4) M(-1). Molecular docking analysis revealed stable protein ligand complexes with compound L(II) showing binding affinities of -6.15 kcal mol(-1) for alpha-glucosidase and -5.83 kcal mol(-1) for alpha-amylase, while DFT calculations indicated HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of 3.93-4.30 eV suggesting moderate chemical reactivity. The in silico drug-likeness and oral bioavailability profiles of pyrazole-chalcone fully comply with Lipinski's criteria and exhibit excellent ADMET properties. These comprehensive findings establish pyrazole chalcone hybrids as promising multifunctional molecular scaffolds with significant potential for next-generation antidiabetic therapeutics."
diabetes,"Lemierre syndrome is a rare and potentially fatal complication of acute oropharyngeal infection, typically causing thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein and sepsis. We present the case of a 65-year-old female patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented with otalgia and left hemifacial pain for eight days. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the neck showed a collection in the left submandibular space. Venous Doppler revealed thrombosis in the left external jugular vein, representing an anatomical variant or an atypical presentation of the disease. In secretion culture, Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated. The patient was treated with antibiotics and anticoagulants and showed clinical improvement, so she was discharged after fourteen days of hospitalization. Lemierre syndrome represents a diagnostic challenge due to its nonspecific clinical presentation however, thrombophlebitis of the head and neck veins is usually the key finding, even in atypical variants."
diabetes,"BACKGROUND: Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have worse outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), even with everolimus-eluting stents (EES). Limited data are available comparing outcomes in DM versus non-DM receiving various bioresorbable polymer (BP) or durable polymer (DP) EES after rotational atherectomy (RA). We aimed to study the impact of DM on outcomes in patients undergoing PCI with BP-EES and DP-EES after RA. METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing PCI with RA between 2014 and 2021 were included. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiac events (MACE), a composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke at 1 year, which was stratified according to DM status. Regression analysis was performed to adjust for confounders. RESULTS: Among 2376 patients (mean age 70.3 +/- 10.7, 49.5 % DM) that underwent RA, 552 received BP-EES and 1824 received DP-EES. Both groups had similar number of stents implanted and stent diameters; however, the BP-EES group had a higher SYNTAX score and was more likely to have multi-vessel disease and undergo PCI to the left anterior descending, circumflex, and right coronary artery. In both BP-EES and DP-EES groups, there was no significant difference in adjusted risk of MACE (BP-EES: 7.3 % vs. 7.1 %, HR 0.78, 95 % CI 0.35-1.78, P = 0.562 & DP-EES: 7.5 % vs. 3.7 %, HR 1.49, 95 % CI 0.89-2.50, P = 0.130) between diabetics and non-diabetics. CONCLUSIONS: Despite differences in baseline characteristics, DM was not associated with worse MACE at one year in patients with complex coronary artery disease undergoing RA and PCI with contemporary BP-EES or DP-EES."
diabetes,"BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are a popular first-line treatment option in managing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) with cardiovascular co morbidities. Studies have established the benefit of GLP-1 RAs in improving cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in patients with T2DM. However, the impact of GLP-1 RAs on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2DM and Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) remains uncertain. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study employed an active-comparator new-user design using the TriNetX Research Network database. Patients aged 18 years or older with T2DM and left ventricular ejection fraction of </=40 % were identified for inclusion. Patients were classified into two groups: GLP-1 RAs users versus dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP4i) users. Propensity score matching (1:1) was conducted based on demographics, body mass index, comorbidities, glycated hemoglobin levels, medications and socioeconomic factors resulting in a matched cohort of 26,196 patients. Outcomes analyzed included all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and all-cause hospitalization. RESULTS: The GLP-1 RA user group demonstrated a reduced hazard ratio (HR, 95 % confidence interval) over 5 years compared with the DPP4i user group for all-cause mortality (0.62, 0.59-0.66, P < 0.001), all-cause hospitalization (0.71, 0.69-0.73, P < 0.001), acute myocardial infarction (0.87, 0.82-0.92, P < 0.001), heart failure exacerbation (0.83, 0.81-0.86, P < 0.001) and cerebrovascular accidents (0.85, 0.80-0.92, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In patients with T2DM and HFrEF, GLP-1 RA therapy shows potential beneficial effects in reducing CV events over 5 years compared to control (DPP4i) group."
diabetes,"BACKGROUND: Observational studies have suggested a potential association between autoimmune diseases and anemia, but the direction of causality remains unclear. To investigate the potential causal relationship between autoimmune diseases and anemia using Mendelian randomization (MR). METHODS: We conducted a bidirectional two-sample MR study using summary-level genetic data from the EBI and FinnGen databases. We examined 21 autoimmune diseases as exposures and anemia as the outcome, and vice versa. Multivariable MR, meta-analysis, and two-step mediation analysis involving 43 candidate mediators were also performed. Proteomic MR and colocalization analyses were used to validate causal relationships involving proteins. Functional annotations including KEGG pathway, GO enrichment, protein-protein interaction networks, and drug enrichment analyses were performed to identify potential therapeutic targets. RESULTS: Genetically determined type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) were associated with an increased risk of anemia (P < 0.05 in meta-analysis). Reverse MR analyses suggested potential bidirectional causality between anemia and mixed connective tissue disease, hypothyroidism, and asthma. Mediation analysis indicated that hypothyroidism may contribute to anemia by elevating IgG levels. Proteomic and colocalization analyses identified several proteins associated with anemia (e.g., MCCD1, TMEM106B), T1DM (e.g., CTRB1, CTRB2, IL7RA), RA (e.g., TGFBI, IL1RN), and PBC (e.g., ALDH2, CXCL16). CONCLUSION: This MR study supports a causal effect of certain autoimmune diseases on anemia risk and highlights potential protein targets for intervention, offering new insights for anemia prevention and treatment."
diabetes,"BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal disorders are often given lower priority and receive little attention in developing countries especially in Ethiopia. Despite extensive research on MSDs, there is no comprehensive evidence in Ethiopia on the magnitude of musculoskeletal disorders. Thus, this study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of musculoskeletal disorders among patients with DM in Ethiopia. METHODS: The study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines outlined by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. The articles were searched using electronic databases including PubMed, Science Direct, and African Journals Online from October 1 to March 30, 2025. The authors carried out data extraction using a standardized form created in MS Excel. RESULTS: Eight studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis study. The study showed that the pooled prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among patients with diabetes mellitus in Ethiopia is 27.79% (95% CI: 21.90-33.68, I (2) = 59.7%). Being female (OR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.35-2.55, I (2) = 0.0%), rural residence(OR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.21-2.95, I (2) = 46.1), age > 50 years (OR = 6.55, 95% CI: 1.23 -34.98, I (2) = 93.9%), hypertension(OR = 4.85, 95% CI 2.59-9.08, I (2) = 73.6%) and DM duration >/= 10 years (OR = 9.41, 95% CI: 1.04-85.08, I (2) = 94.9%) were associated factors of musculoskeletal disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal disorders are highly prevalent among patients with diabetes in Ethiopia, particularly among older adults, those with long-standing diabetes, and individuals with comorbid conditions such as hypertension. These findings underscore the need for targeted screening and early intervention programs for high-risk groups. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42024580332."
diabetes,"Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XPN) is a rare chronic renal infection associated with obstructive nephrolithiasis and recurrent urinary tract infections. Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is an even rarer necrotizing infection characterized by intrarenal gas, most commonly seen in patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Concurrent presentation of XPN and EPN is exceedingly uncommon, with only a few cases reported. We present a case of a 61-year-old female with no history of diabetes who presented with left flank pain, systemic symptoms, and laboratory evidence of infection and microcytic anemia. Abdominal CT revealed imaging features consistent with XPN-including hydronephrosis, a staghorn calculus, and the classic ""bear paw"" sign-alongside intrarenal gas, consistent with EPN. Urine culture grew Proteus mirabilis. The patient underwent nephrectomy and recovered uneventfully with antimicrobial therapy. This case is notable for the rare co-occurrence of XPN and EPN in a euglycemic patient, supporting the hypothesis that chronic obstruction and infection may be sufficient to induce gas-forming infections, even in the absence of hyperglycemia. Awareness of atypical presentations is essential, as early recognition and surgical management are critical to reducing morbidity in these severe renal infections."
diabetes,"Fungal bezoars in the urinary tract are rare and typically present in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with diabetes mellitus. We discuss the case of a 66-year-old bedbound female with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented with intra-abdominal collections secondary to a possible bladder perforation. She was subsequently found to have bladder outlet obstruction secondary to a large fungal bezoar resembling a mucinous bladder tumour. This case highlights the importance of considering fungal bezoars in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with bladder masses, especially in high-risk patients, to prevent misdiagnosis and ensure appropriate treatment."
diabetes,"Background Systemic documentation deficiencies in hospitalized patients with high-acuity conditions such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) can compromise clinical decision-making, risk adjustment, and patient safety. Despite well-established evidence linking chronic conditions like chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and liver failure to adverse outcomes, these comorbidities are often underrepresented in electronic health records (EHRs). This study introduces a statistically rigorous, informatics-assisted framework to benchmark and quantify real-world documentation gaps, advancing the field of clinical documentation integrity (CDI) through actionable metrics. Objective The objectives of this study are to evaluate the accuracy of comorbidity documentation in adult inpatients with SIRS and acute organ dysfunction by applying a benchmarking model based on peer-reviewed prevalence data and to assess the clinical, operational, and financial implications of these documentation deficits. Methods In this retrospective observational study, 82 adult patients admitted with a principal diagnosis of SIRS (ICD-10-CM R65.11) were analyzed using structured chart abstraction from EPIC EHR data. Six high-impact comorbidities were evaluated. Observed documentation rates were compared against literature-derived expected prevalence benchmarks. Gap scores were calculated as proportional differences, and one-sample z-tests were used to assess statistical significance, stratified by age and sex. Results Five of six comorbidities demonstrated statistically significant underdocumentation, with liver failure (expected: 57%, observed: 6.1%; p < 0.001), DM (53% vs. 18.3%; p < 0.001), and HTN (78% vs. 36.6%; p < 0.001) showing the most severe deficiencies. Gap scores ranged from 0.39 to 0.89, revealing systemic failure in documenting clinically relevant conditions. Age and sex stratification further exposed disparities in documentation behavior. Notably, underdocumentation did not correlate with inpatient mortality (p = 0.89), indicating systemic gaps unrelated to clinical outcome visibility. Conclusion This study provides a validated, reproducible framework for identifying and quantifying clinical documentation gaps in real-time. The comorbidity capture gap model integrates seamlessly with EHRs and aligns with CMS risk adjustment frameworks such as Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) and Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG). Its application can enhance clinical accuracy, improve institutional quality metrics, and inform scalable, AI-augmented CDI interventions. The findings underscore a critical opportunity to shift from reactive to proactive documentation practices, transforming the reliability of health data for risk stratification, harm prevention, and healthcare performance reporting."
diabetes,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone, plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis by stimulating insulin secretion, suppressing glucagon release, and delaying gastric emptying. Its therapeutic potential was long realized, leading to the development of the first GLP-1 receptor agonist, exenatide, followed by liraglutide, dulaglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide. Semaglutide is available as a weekly subcutaneous injection with high bioavailability. Semaglutide is the only GLP-1 agonist available for oral therapy, used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Semaglutide has demonstrated broad clinical efficacy beyond glycemic control, including weight reduction, cardiovascular risk reduction, and, most recently, in the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Semaglutide therapy is associated with the resolution of steatohepatitis and improvement in hepatic fibrosis in patients with MASH. Alongside resmetirom, semaglutide is currently approved for the treatment of non-cirrhotic MASH with moderate-to-advanced fibrosis. Safety considerations include gastrointestinal intolerance, hypoglycemia, rare pancreaticobiliary events, and theoretical concerns of thyroid C-cell tumors, though human risk remains minimal. In summary, semaglutide extends the armamentarium of the hepatologist against the most common liver disease worldwide."
diabetes,"Patients with type 2 diabetes who experience myocardial infarction (MI) have up to a twofold higher risk of recurrent cardiovascular events compared with non-diabetic patients, even under optimal medical therapy. Colchicine, an inexpensive anti-inflammatory agent, has been proposed as an adjunctive therapy for secondary prevention. This systematic review evaluates the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of low-dose colchicine in this high-risk population, with emphasis on evidence from the COLCOT trial and related randomized controlled studies. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library was performed for studies published between October 2015 and February 2025. Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg/day) in post-MI patients, including subgroups with type 2 diabetes. Data were extracted on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), individual cardiovascular outcomes, adverse effects, and cost-effectiveness. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool, identifying eight studies with low, four with moderate, and two with high risk of bias. A total of 14 RCTs involving approximately 12,000 participants were included. Colchicine significantly reduced MACE, with hazard ratios ranging from 0.65 to 0.77, and showed consistent benefits in stroke reduction (HR 0.26; 95% CI: 0.10-0.70) and urgent revascularization (HR 0.50; 95% CI: 0.31-0.81). Cost-effectiveness analyses demonstrated a dominant economic profile, lowering healthcare costs while improving quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The most frequent adverse event was gastrointestinal intolerance, while a modest increase in pneumonia incidence was observed (0.9% vs. 0.4%; P = 0.03). No significant rise in cancer incidence or all-cause mortality was noted. Low-dose colchicine provides substantial cardiovascular protection and cost-effectiveness in post-MI patients, particularly those with type 2 diabetes. Although generally safe and well-tolerated, mild gastrointestinal effects and a slightly elevated infection risk warrant clinical vigilance. Further large-scale, standardized, and long-term trials are essential to confirm its role in contemporary secondary prevention."
diabetes,"Diabetic foot infections (DFIs) are frequent and severe complications of diabetes mellitus that can lead to chronic wounds, osteomyelitis, and even limb amputation if not properly managed. This case report describes the clinical consequences of prolonged empirical antibiotic therapy without culture guidance in a patient with a diabetic foot abscess. A 72-year-old man with type 2 diabetes and hypertension presented with a chronic, non-healing deep foot abscess after receiving 15 consecutive courses of empirical oral antibiotics over eight months. Magnetic resonance imaging suggested osteomyelitis of the fifth metatarsal bone. Urgent surgical drainage and tissue cultures revealed Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, both resistant to multiple commonly used antibiotics but susceptible to ceftriaxone and carbapenems. Targeted intravenous therapy with ceftriaxone and metronidazole led to rapid improvement within one week and complete healing by the third month. This case emphasizes that prolonged empirical therapy may lead to treatment failure and antimicrobial resistance. Early surgical intervention combined with culture-guided antibiotic selection is crucial for effective management of DFIs and for preventing severe complications such as amputation. This case underscores the importance of multidisciplinary and microbiologically guided approaches."
diabetes,"The burden of type II diabetes and microvascular complications is increasing around the globe, especially in low- and middle-income countries. We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of type II diabetes and its microvascular complications to determine the nature of diabetes and its complications in Sri Lanka. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL for studies published between 2014 and 2024 on the prevalence of type II diabetes mellitus and its microvascular complications in Sri Lanka. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened against predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria, and data were extracted from eligible studies. Pooled prevalence estimates were calculated using a random effects model, with 95% confidence intervals, and results were presented using forest plots. Analyses were performed using Stata version 18 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, Texas, USA). A total of 1400 articles underwent title, abstract or full text screening and only 11 (0.8%) articles were left for the analysis, which satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria; 15839 people with type II diabetes mellitus (mean sample size n=2263 (SD 2374), with a mean age of 48.6 years (SD 4.94)), were included. The estimated overall prevalence of type II diabetes, diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy was 17% (95% CI 17% to 18%), 13% (95% CI 13% to 14%) and 19% (95% CI 16% to 21%), respectively. The forest plots illustrated variation across individual studies but also showed a consistent upward trend in the prevalence of diabetes over time, with more recent studies reporting higher estimates. Further research into cost-effective methods for early identification and treatment of people with diabetes is needed to reduce the associated morbidity and mortality. Screening for complications at the time of diagnosis should become a routine practice to provide rapid intervention."
diabetes,"Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (euDKA) is a rare but serious complication of diabetes mellitus, consisting of about 3% of DKA presentations, and often associated with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Unlike classic DKA, euDKA presents with ketoacidosis despite normal or only mildly elevated blood glucose levels, which can delay diagnosis and treatment. We report the case of a 77-year-old woman with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes who presented after multiple unprovoked falls that appear to be multifactorial in origin. Initial evaluation revealed dehydration, mild hyperglycemia (glucose 183 mg/dL), elevated anion gap, and positive urine ketones and glucose. Despite treatment with intravenous (IV) fluids and subcutaneous insulin, her condition worsened over the next 24 hours, with progressive acidosis (bicarbonate <10 mmol/L, arterial pH <7.00) and glucose levels remaining below 250 mg/dL. EuDKA was diagnosed, but the patient was unstable and was moved to the ICU. Dapagliflozin was discontinued, and she was treated successfully with IV insulin and aggressive fluid resuscitation. This case illustrates the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for euDKA in elderly patients on SGLT2 inhibitors, particularly when presenting with nonspecific symptoms such as confusion or falls. Early recognition, prompt discontinuation of the SGLT2 inhibitor, and appropriate management are critical to improving outcomes."
diabetes,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the differences in lipid metabolites between patients with diabetes mellitus combined with hyperuricemia (DH) and diabetes mellitus (DM) and healthy controls, and to initially reveal the changes in lipid metabolic pathways in DH. METHODS: Using a present study method, 17 patients each diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and diabetes mellitus combined with hyperuric acid among permanent residents aged 18 years and above in Fuzhou City, Fujian Province, China, from June 2019 to July 2020 were selected, matched 1:1 by sex and age, and 17 healthy controls were randomly selected and fasting blood samples were collected. The untargeted lipid histology analysis was performed using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) based technique, and the Student's t-test and multiple of difference (FC) were used to initially screen the differential lipid molecules and determine their trends; principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to observe the overall distribution of the two groups of samples. Finally, we used Metabo Analyst 5.0 platform to analyze the differential lipid metabolism pathways. RESULTS: We identified 1,361 lipid molecules across 30 subclasses. Multivariate analyses revealed a significant separation trend among the DH, DM, and NGT groups, confirming distinct lipidomic profiles. A total of 31 significantly altered lipid metabolites were pinpointed in the DH group compared to the NGT controls. Among the most relevant individual metabolites, 13 triglycerides (TGs), such as TG (16:0/18:1/18:2), 10 phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), e.g., PE (18:0/20:4), and 7 phosphatidylcholines (PCs) including PC (36:1), were significantly upregulated, while one phosphatidylinositol (PI) was downregulated. The collective analysis of these metabolite groups revealed their enrichment in six major metabolic pathways. Crucially, glycerophospholipid metabolism with an impact value of 0.199 and glycerolipid metabolism with an impact value of 0.014 were identified as the most significantly perturbed pathways in DH patients. Furthermore, comparison of DH versus DM groups identified 12 differential lipids, which were also predominantly enriched in these same core pathways, underscoring their central role in the pathophysiology of hyperuricemia complicating diabetes. CONCLUSION: Patients with combined diabetes mellitus and hyperuricemia have significantly altered lipid metabolites compared to diabetic patients and healthy controls. A total of 31 significantly different lipid molecules were identified, and abnormalities in glycerophospholipid metabolism and glycerolipid metabolism pathways were found in DH patients."
diabetes,"Diabetes mellitus is a group of chronic metabolic diseases worldwide that seriously threaten human health and increases the social and economic burden; underlying drivers of impaired healing include uncontrolled inflammation, repeated ischemia reperfusion injury, and neuropathy alongside infection risks. Macrophages orchestrate standard repair, exhibit sustained classical pro-inflammatory activation in diabetes, disrupting growth factor secretion, angiogenesis, and matrix regulation. Hyperglycemia mediated advanced glycation end products and reactive oxygen species heighten pattern recognition receptor stimulation, causing reduced alternative macrophage differentiation. Promising immunomodulation approaches redirecting their phenotypes to resolve inflammation and stimulate regeneration provides optimism. We discuss macrophage origination, polarization dynamics, diabetic wounds phenotypic imbalance, and critical microenvironmental disruptions perpetuating pathological function. Elucidating specific regulatory nodes upholding their activation states will inform intelligent targeting opportunities. Overall, infiltrating macrophages constitute indispensable yet amenable diabetic wound healing coordinators."
diabetes,"INTRODUCTION: Bacterial pericarditis is rare in the antibiotic era but remains potentially fatal due to rapid progression and high mortality. Herein, we report an unusual case of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) pericarditis with a transudative pleural effusion in a patient with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), illustrating the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in a complex patient. PATIENT CONCERNS AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 47-year-old female patient with a history of presumptive ischemic cardiomyopathy, uncontrolled DM (a glycated hemoglobin level of 14.2%), and treated pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) presented with pleuritic chest tightness, fever, and dyspnea. Examinations and investigations revealed a moderate-to-large pericardial effusion, ST-segment elevation on an electrocardiogram, and high inflammatory markers. Imaging showed a pericardial effusion, raising suspicion for bacterial pericarditis. Pleural tap of an adjacent pleural effusion nearby was however transudative. DIAGNOSIS INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: Pericardiocentesis was not feasible due to the loculated pericardial effusion and absence of a safe window; however, S. aureus was detected by polymerase chain reaction testing of the patient's pleural fluid. Cardiothoracic surgeons performed a pericardial window and biopsy, confirming MSSA pericarditis. Surgical drainage was successful and the patient completed 6 weeks of intravenous cefazolin with full recovery. CONCLUSION: This case emphasizes the need to consider bacterial etiologies, including MSSA, when evaluating pericarditis in immunocompromised patients, especially those with DM or prior TB. Multimodal imaging, molecular diagnostics, and early surgical consultation are important in cases where pericardiocentesis is not feasible. Invasive diagnostic strategies may be critical for achieving a microbiological diagnosis and ensuring timely source control. Multidisciplinary collaboration is essential when managing complex pericardial infections to optimize diagnostic certainty and outcomes."
diabetes,"BACKGROUND: Intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (VEGFis) are a standard treatment for diabetic eye complications. However, concerns persist regarding their potential nephrotoxic effects in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), who are inherently at increased risk of renal disease due to diabetes-related microvascular damage. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating renal-related adverse events in DM adults receiving intravitreal VEGFis versus controls. The primary outcome was occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI), and the secondary outcome was the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Fixed-effects models pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: From 16 RCTs (n = 5,930 patients), pooled analyses showed no significant increase in renal risk with VEGFis. The incidence of AKI (10 trials) showed no significant difference between the VEGFis groups (2.0%) and controls (1.5%; OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.65-1.75; GRADE very low quality). Similarly, the incidence of CKD (15 trials) was comparable in VEGFis groups (2.4%) versus controls (2.1%; OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.75-1.64; GRADE very low quality). Subgroup analyses of AKI incidence stratified by VEGFis types, injection numbers, and treatment duration showed similar event rates across all subgroups, with no statistically significant differences observed. CONCLUSION: Current evidence does not indicate a clear increase in the risk of AKI or CKD with intravitreal VEGFis in adults with DM, but the certainty is very low, and high-risk subgroups remain insufficiently studied."
diabetes,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a severe, chronic and complex metabolic disease that leads to multiple dysfunctions, including micro and macrovascular complications, which are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Type 2 DM (T2D) is highly preventable, and the stages that precede it are the ideal target for therapeutic intervention. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is an established medical treatment for several clinical conditions. Because DM is one of the most prevalent comorbidities in patients under HBOT, it has allowed the observation and inference of some of its effects on DM, suggesting clinical benefit in different spectrums of the disease. Our main aim was to gather the existing evidence on the impact of HBOT on insulin resistance, as this is the best predictor for the development of T2D. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The scoping review was the methodology chosen to include all available data. Exclusion criteria consisted of articles that did not mention the effects of HBOT on insulin resistance, described only the use of normobaric oxygen, or had no available translation to English, Spanish, or Portuguese. In addition, all data discussing any effects on insulin, insulin resistance, or insulin sensitivity were included. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty studies were found, and 17 were eligible. The HBOT appears to improve fasting glycaemia and decrease insulin resistance in patients with DM, with effects appearing after 1 treatment session. Additionally, it reduces levels of proinflammatory cytokines that contribute to insulin resistance. The duration of this sensitisation effect remains unknown, as do the contributing molecular factors. CONCLUSION: HBOT seems to improve glycaemic levels and insulin sensitivity, thus presenting a potential treatment approach to treat insulin resistance and its consequences. However, translation into clinical practice remains contingent on robust, yet unavailable, randomized clinical trials."
