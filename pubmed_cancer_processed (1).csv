cancer,"BACKGROUND: Placental tissue contains a variety of tumor-associated antigens. Antigen-specific T cells generated by expanded dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with placental peptides have the potential to exert antitumor effects both in vitro and in vivo. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the immunotherapeutic potential of placental peptides as a novel source of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). We hypothesized that DCs, expanded and matured in vitro and pulsed with placental peptide extracts, can effectively prime antigen-specific T cells (ASTs) with robust cytotoxic activity against various tumor cell lines and in vivo tumor models. METHODS: Mass spectrometry was used to identify tumor-related peptides within the placental extract. In vitro assays were employed to assess the expansion of DCs, their maturation following exposure to placental peptide preparations, and the subsequent activation of T cells. RESULTS: The cytotoxic activity of ASTs was assessed and showed strong tumor cell killing across three cancer cell lines, U87MG (glioblastoma), SH-SY5Y (neuroblastoma), and MCF-7 (breast cancer). In a neuroblastoma animal model, ASTs treatment significantly reduced tumor proliferation, indicating substantial therapeutic potential in vivo. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that DCs pulsed with placental peptides can generate ASTs with potent antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Additional studies are needed to determine applicability across other tumor types, refine therapeutic parameters, and assess clinical potential.",background placent tissu contain varieti tumorassoci antigen antigenspecif cell gener expand dendrit cell dc load placent peptid potenti exert antitumor effect vitro vivo object investig immunotherapeut potenti placent peptid novel sourc tumorassoci antigen taa hypothes dc expand matur vitro puls placent peptid extract effect prime antigenspecif cell ast robust cytotox activ variou tumor cell line vivo tumor model method mass spectrometri use identifi tumorrel peptid within placent extract vitro assay employ assess expans dc matur follow exposur placent peptid prepar subsequ activ cell result cytotox activ ast assess show strong tumor cell kill across three cancer cell line u87mg glioblastoma shsy5i neuroblastoma mcf7 breast cancer neuroblastoma anim model ast treatment significantli reduc tumor prolifer indic substanti therapeut potenti vivo conclus find suggest dc puls placent peptid gener ast potent antitumor activ vitro vivo addit studi need determin applic across tumor type refin therapeut paramet assess clinic potenti
cancer,"BACKGROUND Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a pulmonary disorder that occurs in patients allergic to Aspergillus species. It is typically characterized by reversible airway obstruction, transient pulmonary infiltrates, eosinophilia, and fever. Chest radiographs and high-resolution computed tomography (CT) are essential for diagnosis and differential diagnosis. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a tumor-specific marker, is often elevated in various malignant tumors but can also be increased in nonmalignant conditions. This overlap can result in misdiagnosis and unnecessary anxiety, leading to inappropriate clinical management. We report a case of ABPA presenting with pulmonary shadows that mimicked lung cancer, as well as elevated serum CEA levels. This report aims to enhance clinicians' understanding of ABPA, improve diagnostic accuracy, and reduce the likelihood of misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis. CASE REPORT A 39-year-old woman with a history of bronchial asthma presented with a productive cough. Chest CT revealed solid lesions in the left upper pulmonary lobe with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Her serum CEA level was elevated, raising suspicion of malignancy. A positron emission tomography-CT scan demonstrated increased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the lungs. However, a CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy, combined with other relevant diagnostic tests, confirmed ABPA according to the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) criteria. After corticosteroid therapy, both the radiographic findings and serum CEA levels improved. CONCLUSIONS To avoid unnecessary invasive procedures and misdiagnosis of malignancy, ABPA should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with asthma who present with pulmonary solid lesions and elevated serum CEA levels.",background allerg bronchopulmonari aspergillosi abpa pulmonari disord occur patient allerg aspergillu speci typic character revers airway obstruct transient pulmonari infiltr eosinophilia fever chest radiograph highresolut comput tomographi ct essenti diagnosi differenti diagnosi carcinoembryon antigen cea tumorspecif marker often elev variou malign tumor also increas nonmalign condit overlap result misdiagnosi unnecessari anxieti lead inappropri clinic manag report case abpa present pulmonari shadow mimick lung cancer well elev serum cea level report aim enhanc clinician understand abpa improv diagnost accuraci reduc likelihood misdiagnosi miss diagnosi case report 39yearold woman histori bronchial asthma present product cough chest ct reveal solid lesion left upper pulmonari lobe mediastin lymphadenopathi serum cea level elev rais suspicion malign positron emiss tomographyct scan demonstr increas fluorodeoxyglucos uptak lung howev ctguid percutan lung biopsi combin relev diagnost test confirm abpa accord intern societi human anim mycolog isham criteria corticosteroid therapi radiograph find serum cea level improv conclus avoid unnecessari invas procedur misdiagnosi malign abpa consid differenti diagnosi patient asthma present pulmonari solid lesion elev serum cea level
cancer,"A new cyclic dipeptide, cyclo(phenylalanine-proline) (cFP), was isolated from the marine bacterium Exiguobacterium profundum SW22 and characterized by NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry. In silico profiling predicted favorable pharmacokinetic and drug-like properties for cFP. The compound demonstrated dose-dependent cytotoxicity against human breast (MDA MB-231), pancreatic (PAN C1), and prostate (PC 3) cancer cell lines with IC(5)(0) values of 47.24 +/- 0.42, 40.96 +/- 0.68, and 110 +/- 1.48 microM, respectively, accompanied by apoptosis-associated morphological changes. Biophysical studies demonstrated strong binding affinity between cFP and human serum albumin (HSA), confirmed through UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence quenching, and circular dichroism analyses, with validation using well-characterized reference ligand warfarin as control. Results suggest static quenching via ground-state complex formation with negligible lifetime changes, consistent with control molecule (warfarin) binding via hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions, accompanied by ligand-induced decreases in HSA alpha-helical content. Molecular docking studies of HSA with cFP and warfarin revealed strong binding affinities for both compounds. Further, the molecular dynamics simulations over a 50 ns timeframe confirmed the enhanced stability and persistent interaction of the cFP-HSA complex. Results highlight the cFP as a promising bioactive peptide with potential anticancer, pharmacokinetic and serum binding efficacies advocating further preclinical development for anticancer therapy.",new cyclic dipeptid cyclophenylalanineprolin cfp isol marin bacterium exiguobacterium profundum sw22 character nmr highresolut mass spectrometri silico profil predict favor pharmacokinet druglik properti cfp compound demonstr dosedepend cytotox human breast mda mb231 pancreat pan c1 prostat pc 3 cancer cell line ic50 valu 4724 042 4096 068 110 148 microm respect accompani apoptosisassoci morpholog chang biophys studi demonstr strong bind affin cfp human serum albumin hsa confirm uvvis absorpt spectroscopi fluoresc quench circular dichroism analys valid use wellcharacter refer ligand warfarin control result suggest static quench via groundstat complex format neglig lifetim chang consist control molecul warfarin bind via hydrogen bond van der waal interact accompani ligandinduc decreas hsa alphahel content molecular dock studi hsa cfp warfarin reveal strong bind affin compound molecular dynam simul 50 ns timefram confirm enhanc stabil persist interact cfphsa complex result highlight cfp promis bioactiv peptid potenti anticanc pharmacokinet serum bind efficaci advoc preclin develop anticanc therapi
cancer,"The therapeutic targeting of kinase signaling pathways represents a pivotal strategy in gastric cancer, yet the rational design of single agents capable of dual-kinase inhibition remains a challenge in precision oncology. Here, we develop the DuoKinaseNet, a dual-task spectral graph neural network that integrates global topological information from a heterogeneous biomedical graph to enable structure-preserving prediction of drug-kinase interactions. The core innovation of our model is the Structure-Preserving Spectral Expansion (SPSE) module, which injects global graph topology from a biomedical knowledge graph into the learning process via spectral coordinates and diffusion-distance biased attention. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset curated from DrugBank, DuoKinaseNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on the challenging ""unseen protein"" benchmark, with an AUC-ROC of 0.903 for HER2 and 0.895 for FGFR2b. It significantly outperforms a wide range of baseline models, including 3D-aware methods and single-task variants, empirically validating the synergistic benefits of the dual-task learning and SPSE frameworks.",therapeut target kinas signal pathway repres pivot strategi gastric cancer yet ration design singl agent capabl dualkinas inhibit remain challeng precis oncolog develop duokinasenet dualtask spectral graph neural network integr global topolog inform heterogen biomed graph enabl structurepreserv predict drugkinas interact core innov model structurepreserv spectral expans spse modul inject global graph topolog biomed knowledg graph learn process via spectral coordin diffusiondist bias attent evalu comprehens dataset curat drugbank duokinasenet achiev stateoftheart perform particularli challeng unseen protein benchmark aucroc 0903 her2 0895 fgfr2b significantli outperform wide rang baselin model includ 3dawar method singletask variant empir valid synergist benefit dualtask learn spse framework
cancer,"In 2022, Hanahan integrated polymorphic microbiomes to the hallmarks of cancer, resulting in 14 overarching features that are considered fundamental to initiation and progression of cancers. It is well acknowledged that genomic instability/genetic alterations together with tumor-associated inflammation are so called ""enabling hallmarks"" as they drive the acquisition of the other traits. The microbiome is a key component of the inflammatory tumor stroma. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in particular is characterized by a pronounced stromal compartment whose role in the acquisition of malignant properties is well documented. Recent studies indicate massive alterations of the microbiome in PDAC tissues compared to healthy pancreas or precursor lesions. However, the mechanistic role of the PDAC-associated microbiome, its influence on the hallmarks of cancer, and how this relates to PDAC malignancy remain poorly understood. This raises the question of whether the tumor-associated microbiome through its direct influence on PDAC cells, their precursors, and the surrounding non-neoplastic cells promotes the acquisition of other hallmarks that drive PDAC development and progression. This perspective article outlines the current knowledge of the impact of the PDAC-associated microbiome on the hallmarks of cancer in PDAC. These current findings support the altered microbiome as a third enabling hallmark of PDAC and emphasize that further mechanistic studies are urgently needed to further substantiate its fundamental importance for this tumor entity. This knowledge will provide the basis for clinical translation to develop more effective therapeutic approaches for PDAC. The intratumoral microbiome in PDAC exhibits numerous interactions with the hallmarks of cancer. Hallmarks indicated in blue have demonstrated interactions with the microbiome, while others still remain underexplored. These extensive interactions substantiate the role of the intratumoral microbiome in PDAC as an enabling hallmark, underlining its potential as a therapeutic target.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence is rising among adults under 55 years, but its causes remain unclear. Large-scale prospective studies are needed to identify risk factors for early-onset CRC (EOCRC). METHODS: We pooled three large European prospective cohort studies, examining 14 known or suspected risk factors with EOCRC (diagnosed <55 years, N = 1369) and later-onset CRCs (LOCRC) (diagnosed >/=55 years, N = 13,490). Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Higher body mass index (BMI, per 5 kg/m(2) increase), was strongly associated with EOCRC in men (HR 1.33, 95% CI: 1.18-1.51), particularly for early-onset colon cancer (HR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.32-1.82), compared to later-onset disease (HR 1.25, 95% CI: 1.19-1.31) (Phet = 0.01). Weaker associations with BMI were observed for women and rectal cancers. Similar sex and subsite specific trends were observed for waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio. Current smoking (HR 1.24, 95% CI: 1.07-1.44) and alcohol use (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06-1.25) increased EOCRC risk, and physical activity (HR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.54-0.95) was protective. DISCUSSION: Adiposity, physical inactivity, smoking, and alcohol consumption are risk factors for EOCRC. Risk factors were largely similar between EOCRC and LOCRC, except for adiposity, with stronger EOCRC association in men.",background colorect cancer crc incid rise among adult 55 year caus remain unclear largescal prospect studi need identifi risk factor earlyonset crc eocrc method pool three larg european prospect cohort studi examin 14 known suspect risk factor eocrc diagnos 55 year n 1369 lateronset crc locrc diagnos 55 year n 13490 cox proport hazard model estim hazard ratio hr 95 confid interv ci result higher bodi mass index bmi per 5 kgm2 increas strongli associ eocrc men hr 133 95 ci 118151 particularli earlyonset colon cancer hr 155 95 ci 132182 compar lateronset diseas hr 125 95 ci 119131 phet 001 weaker associ bmi observ women rectal cancer similar sex subsit specif trend observ waist circumfer waisttohip ratio current smoke hr 124 95 ci 107144 alcohol use hr 115 95 ci 106125 increas eocrc risk physic activ hr 071 95 ci 054095 protect discuss adipos physic inact smoke alcohol consumpt risk factor eocrc risk factor larg similar eocrc locrc except adipos stronger eocrc associ men
cancer,"Lactylation, a recently identified histone modification derived from lactate metabolism, has emerged as a critical regulator of epigenetic reprogramming, tumor proliferation, and immune evasion. In ovarian cancer, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and other metabolic enzymes contribute to lactate accumulation, which supports chemotherapy resistance and disease progression. Although lactylation is increasingly linked to therapy failure, its precise molecular connection with ovarian cancer, as well as its therapeutic potential are unclear. Traditional analytical approaches often fail to integrate the complexity of multi-omics, limiting the discovery of actionable lactylation-associated vulnerabilities. This research aims to develop an AI-driven multi-omics framework to identify lactylation-related genes, stratify patient drug responses, and establish prognostic signatures in ovarian cancer. Transcriptomic, epigenomic, pharmacogenomic, mutation, and clinical outcome data were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC), and independent ovarian cancer cohorts. Deep learning models, including variational autoencoders (VAEs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Multitask Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) (LSTM-MLP), were applied for molecular subtyping, survival analysis, and IC50 prediction. Findings were validated through pathway enrichment, mutation mapping, immune infiltration profiling, and structure-guided drug repurposing, the proposed method achieved precision of (0.955). Key lactylation-related genes, including LDHA and SLC16A3, were associated with immune exhaustion and cisplatin resistance. The Gln-TEx score and lactylation risk signature robustly predicted patient survival and drug response across TCGA and validation cohorts. Perturbation sensitivity and repurposing analyses revealed novel therapeutic vulnerabilities. This study establishes a precision oncology framework that integrates lactylation biology with AI-driven analytics to uncover druggable targets, enhance patient stratification, and inform the design of multi-target therapies in ovarian cancer.",lactyl recent identifi histon modif deriv lactat metabol emerg critic regul epigenet reprogram tumor prolifer immun evas ovarian cancer lactat dehydrogenas ldha metabol enzym contribut lactat accumul support chemotherapi resist diseas progress although lactyl increasingli link therapi failur precis molecular connect ovarian cancer well therapeut potenti unclear tradit analyt approach often fail integr complex multiom limit discoveri action lactylationassoci vulner research aim develop aidriven multiom framework identifi lactylationrel gene stratifi patient drug respons establish prognost signatur ovarian cancer transcriptom epigenom pharmacogenom mutat clinic outcom data collect cancer genom atla tcga genom drug sensit cancer gdsc independ ovarian cancer cohort deep learn model includ variat autoencod vae long shortterm memori lstm network multitask multilay perceptron mlp lstmmlp appli molecular subtyp surviv analysi ic50 predict find valid pathway enrich mutat map immun infiltr profil structureguid drug repurpos propos method achiev precis 0955 key lactylationrel gene includ ldha slc16a3 associ immun exhaust cisplatin resist glntex score lactyl risk signatur robustli predict patient surviv drug respons across tcga valid cohort perturb sensit repurpos analys reveal novel therapeut vulner studi establish precis oncolog framework integr lactyl biolog aidriven analyt uncov druggabl target enhanc patient stratif inform design multitarget therapi ovarian cancer
cancer,"Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is an antibody-drug conjugate successfully used to treat HER2-low and HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, but resistance consistently develops. Using multivariate Cox proportional hazards in a real-world cohort of 2,799 patients with breast cancer, we aimed to identify clinically relevant T-DXd resistance mechanisms. In patients with samples collected prior to T-DXd treatment, higher expression of ERBB2 (HER2) and lower expression of ABCC1 (an ATP-binding cassette transporter involved in drug efflux) were significantly associated with longer T-DXd-related overall survival (OS); ABCC1 predicted OS independently of HER2. Furthermore, mutations in several genes were enriched in post-T-DXd samples compared to unmatched T-DXd-naive samples, including ERBB2, NFE2L2 (a transcriptional activator of ABCC1), and KEAP1 (a negative regulator of NFE2L2), indicating plausible resistance mechanisms related to HER2 target levels and ABCC1-mediated drug efflux.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: To explore the clinical effect and practical value of perioperative composite insulation scheme in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, we will enroll 100 patients aged over 65 years, schemed for laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery under general anesthesia. They will be randomly assigned to two groups: the conventional group will adopt the traditional insulation intervention, and the intervention group will implement the composite insulation care intervention. Changes in heart rate and blood pressure between immediately 15 and 30 min after surgery and the incidence of anesthesia recovery and complications between the two groups will be recorded and analyzed. DISCUSSION: It is expected that the perioperative composite insulation intervention strategy can effectively maintain the patient's body temperature, reduce the postoperative stress response, and reduce the incidence of hypothermia and related complications. It can improve the surgical safety and the quality of postoperative recovery in elderly patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (https://www.chictr.org.cn/) ChiCTR2400088729.

cancer,"Extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs) are circular DNA molecules prevalent in human cancers that drive tumor evolution and drug resistance. Their circular topology, which disrupts topological domains and rewires regulatory circuits, has typically been studied via pairwise interactions. Here we develop ec3D, a computational method for reconstructing three-dimensional ecDNA structures from Hi-C data. Given a candidate ecDNA sequence and whole-genome Hi-C data, ec3D reconstructs spatial structures by maximizing the Poisson likelihood of observed interactions. We validate ec3D using simulated structures, previously characterized cancer cell lines, and microscopy imaging. Our reconstructions reveal that ecDNAs occupy spherical configurations and mediate unique long-range regulatory interactions involved in gene regulation. Through algorithmic innovations, ec3D can resolve complex structures with duplicated segments, identify multi-way interactions, and identify potential intermolecular (trans) interactions. Our findings provide insights into how ecDNA's spatial organization bypasses normal chromosomal constraints and contributes to increased oncogene expression.",extrachromosom dna ecdna circular dna molecul preval human cancer drive tumor evolut drug resist circular topolog disrupt topolog domain rewir regulatori circuit typic studi via pairwis interact develop ec3d comput method reconstruct threedimension ecdna structur hic data given candid ecdna sequenc wholegenom hic data ec3d reconstruct spatial structur maxim poisson likelihood observ interact valid ec3d use simul structur previous character cancer cell line microscopi imag reconstruct reveal ecdna occupi spheric configur mediat uniqu longrang regulatori interact involv gene regul algorithm innov ec3d resolv complex structur duplic segment identifi multiway interact identifi potenti intermolecular tran interact find provid insight ecdna spatial organ bypass normal chromosom constraint contribut increas oncogen express
cancer,"The human gut microbiota serves as a critical hub for host metabolic and immune regulation. Disruption of its homeostasis is closely associated with diseases such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), metabolic syndrome, and colorectal cancer. Modern dietary and environmental factors are known to exacerbate this dysbiosis, highlighting the need for innovative interventions capable of modulating the gut ecosystem. Within this context, this review explores the potential of edible fungi, focusing on culinary mushrooms (e.g., Lentinula edodes) and medicinal fungi such as Ganoderma lucidum and Phellinus linteus, which are widely studied in Asia for their health benefits. While consumed as functional foods for their nutritional properties in some countries, they are used in traditional medicine in others. This review examines the role of their bioactive components (e.g., polysaccharides, terpenoids) in remodeling the gut microbiome, thereby highlighting their application in functional foods and dietary interventions. This review systematically examines the pathological mechanisms underlying gut dysbiosis and elucidates how bioactive fungal components (e.g., beta-glucans, ganoderic acids) improve intestinal barrier function and immune homeostasis by modulating the composition of the gut microbiota, enhancing the production of SCFAs (short-chain fatty acids), and inhibiting the colonization of pathogens. Current evidence, primarily from preclinical studies, suggests that bioactive fungal components, such as beta-glucans from Ganoderma lucidum and polysaccharides from Trametes versicolor, may impart health benefits against metabolic disorders and neoplasms. These benefits are mediated through the modulation of microbiota-derived metabolites (e.g., SCFAs) and epigenetic remodeling mechanisms (e.g., HDAC (Histone Deacetylase) inhibition), suggesting their potential application in functional foods and nutritional strategies. metabolites (e.g., SCFAs) and epigenetic remodeling mechanisms (e.g., HDAC inhibition). However, critical gaps persist, particularly in translating these preclinical findings to humans. Key challenges include understanding their bioavailability, establishing human-relevant dose-response relationships, and elucidating spatiotemporal dynamics within microbiota-host interaction networks. Addressing these gaps requires integration with multi-omics technologies and well-designed clinical trials. Multi-omics and organoid models should be integrated by future research to advance precision medicine applications of fungal-derived therapies.",human gut microbiota serv critic hub host metabol immun regul disrupt homeostasi close associ diseas inflammatori bowel diseas ibd metabol syndrom colorect cancer modern dietari environment factor known exacerb dysbiosi highlight need innov intervent capabl modul gut ecosystem within context review explor potenti edibl fungi focus culinari mushroom eg lentinula edod medicin fungi ganoderma lucidum phellinu linteu wide studi asia health benefit consum function food nutrit properti countri use tradit medicin other review examin role bioactiv compon eg polysaccharid terpenoid remodel gut microbiom therebi highlight applic function food dietari intervent review systemat examin patholog mechan underli gut dysbiosi elucid bioactiv fungal compon eg betaglucan ganoder acid improv intestin barrier function immun homeostasi modul composit gut microbiota enhanc product scfa shortchain fatti acid inhibit colon pathogen current evid primarili preclin studi suggest bioactiv fungal compon betaglucan ganoderma lucidum polysaccharid tramet versicolor may impart health benefit metabol disord neoplasm benefit mediat modul microbiotaderiv metabolit eg scfa epigenet remodel mechan eg hdac histon deacetylas inhibit suggest potenti applic function food nutrit strategi metabolit eg scfa epigenet remodel mechan eg hdac inhibit howev critic gap persist particularli translat preclin find human key challeng includ understand bioavail establish humanrelev doserespons relationship elucid spatiotempor dynam within microbiotahost interact network address gap requir integr multiom technolog welldesign clinic trial multiom organoid model integr futur research advanc precis medicin applic fungalderiv therapi
cancer,"HER2, encoded by the ERBB2 gene, is a receptor tyrosine kinase frequently activated in human cancers via gene amplification, mutation, and/or protein overexpression. In an analysis of 42,415 prospectively analyzed solid tumors, we show that 14.5% of urothelial cancers (n = 295/2,035) have oncogenic or likely oncogenic ERBB2 alterations (6.7% ERBB2 mutation, 6.3% amplification of wildtype ERBB2, and 1.5% concurrent mutation and amplification). Discordance of ERBB2 mutational status between primary and metastatic disease sites is common in patients with urothelial cancer as is discordance of ERBB2 mutational status between patient-derived organoid/xenograft models and the tumors from which they were derived. In patient-derived urothelial cancer models, the HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) trastuzumab deruxtecan is significantly more effective than the HER kinase inhibitor neratinib. In a real-world cohort of patients with urothelial cancer treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan, co-mutation and amplification of ERBB2 is associated with exceptional clinical response. Our data support expanded clinical trials of HER2-targeted ADCs for urothelial cancers with low HER2 expression, the clinical testing of HER2 ADCs with alternative cytotoxic payloads, and the development of functional precision oncology platforms capable of assessing payload sensitivity pre-treatment as a guide to individualized therapy selection.",her2 encod erbb2 gene receptor tyrosin kinas frequent activ human cancer via gene amplif mutat andor protein overexpress analysi 42415 prospect analyz solid tumor show 145 urotheli cancer n 2952035 oncogen like oncogen erbb2 alter 67 erbb2 mutat 63 amplif wildtyp erbb2 15 concurr mutat amplif discord erbb2 mutat statu primari metastat diseas site common patient urotheli cancer discord erbb2 mutat statu patientderiv organoidxenograft model tumor deriv patientderiv urotheli cancer model her2target antibodydrug conjug adc trastuzumab deruxtecan significantli effect kinas inhibitor neratinib realworld cohort patient urotheli cancer treat trastuzumab deruxtecan comut amplif erbb2 associ except clinic respons data support expand clinic trial her2target adc urotheli cancer low her2 express clinic test her2 adc altern cytotox payload develop function precis oncolog platform capabl assess payload sensit pretreat guid individu therapi select
cancer,"To establish an effective radiological risk stratification feature for metachronous metastasis of colon cancer. This retrospective, single-center study enrolled patients with stage II/III colon cancer who underwent curative surgery between December 2016 and September 2020. The ecological spatial characteristics of tumor habitats at the Class-level and Landscape-level were extracted by landscape pattern analysis. Univariate and multivariate COX regression analysis were used to determine the spatial characteristics related to metachronous metastasis and included in the prediction model, and the landscape score value was constructed to stratified the risk of metachronous metastasis. The predictive performance was evaluated using the time-dependent area under the ROC curve (AUC). Metachronous metastases occurred in 31 of 93 patients (median age, 61 years, [IQR, 51-65 years]). GYRATE-MD (HR: 1.67[95%CI: 1.14, 2.45]; P < 0.05) and CIRCLE-MD (HR: 0[95%CI: 0, 0.41]; P < 0.05) were significantly associated with metachronous distant metastasis. The COX regression prediction model based on ecological spatial characteristics showed that the area under the ROC curve was 0.78 (95%CI: 0.65, 0.91) in the training set and 0.78 (95%CI: 0.58, 0.97) in the validation set in two years after surgery.

cancer,"The secreted phospholipase A(2) human group IIA (hGIIA) is overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCa), where its expression is closely aligned with malignancy. While its enzymatic activity is important in mediating innate immunity, here we highlight that hGIIA contributes to PCa pathology primarily through specific protein-protein interactions. We have developed cyclic peptides cF and c2, derived from the structure of hGIIA, that selectively inhibit these interactions and inhibit PCa growth. hGIIA interacts directly with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), resulting in increased cytosolic PLA(2)-alpha activation and prostaglandin E(2) production, which is suppressed by c2. Further, vimentin was identified to bind hGIIA in PCa cells, modulating hGIIA intracellular trafficking. c2 binds vimentin, blocking this interaction and initiating vimentin-mediated aggresome formation and apoptosis even in the absence of hGIIA. cF and c2 suppress androgen-sensitive, castrate-resistant and androgen-independent models of tumour growth in vivo at doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg, are non-toxic, orally bioavailable and cell-permeable. Critically, as with hGIIA, EGFR and vimentin are also increasingly expressed as PCa develops, cF and c2 may represent a novel therapeutic option for incurable metastatic castrate resistant PCa. Our findings identify hGIIA as an innate immune effector that regulates both inflammation and PCa progression and describe a novel class of hGIIA protein-protein interaction inhibitor with therapeutic potential in PCa.",secret phospholipas a2 human group iia hgiia overexpress prostat cancer pca express close align malign enzymat activ import mediat innat immun highlight hgiia contribut pca patholog primarili specif proteinprotein interact develop cyclic peptid cf c2 deriv structur hgiia select inhibit interact inhibit pca growth hgiia interact directli epiderm growth factor receptor egfr result increas cytosol pla2alpha activ prostaglandin e2 product suppress c2 vimentin identifi bind hgiia pca cell modul hgiia intracellular traffick c2 bind vimentin block interact initi vimentinmedi aggresom format apoptosi even absenc hgiia cf c2 suppress androgensensit castrateresist androgenindepend model tumour growth vivo dose low 01 mgkg nontox oral bioavail cellperm critic hgiia egfr vimentin also increasingli express pca develop cf c2 may repres novel therapeut option incur metastat castrat resist pca find identifi hgiia innat immun effector regul inflamm pca progress describ novel class hgiia proteinprotein interact inhibitor therapeut potenti pca
cancer,"Carbon quantum dot (CQD)-based nanozymes have attracted growing interest for advanced biomedical applications owing to their superior catalytic activity, photostability, and biocompatibility. However, the rational design of a multifunctional nanoplatform that integrates active targeting, multimodal imaging, and synergistic therapy through a green and sustainable approach remains highly challenging. Herein, we report a facile and environmentally benign solvothermal strategy for the synthesis of ruthenium-doped CQD nanozymes (Ru-CQDs) functionalized with AS1411 aptamers and polyethylene glycol (PEG), denoted as Ru-CQDs-AS1411@PEG. This eco-friendly synthesis avoids toxic reagents and harsh conditions while yielding highly uniform and biocompatible nanozymes. The obtained Ru-CQDs-AS1411@PEG exhibit strong NIR-II absorption, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and pronounced peroxidase-mimicking catalytic activity. The AS1411 aptamer confers active tumor-targeting capability, while PEGylation enhances aqueous dispersibility and physiological stability. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that Ru-CQDs-AS1411@PEG enable precise photoacoustic tumor imaging and potent tumor ablation under NIR-II laser irradiation via synergistic photothermal and catalytic reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This work provides a green-engineered, aptamer-guided CQD nanozyme platform with integrated targeting, imaging, and therapeutic functionalities, offering a promising and sustainable approach for precision cancer theranostics.",carbon quantum dot cqdbase nanozym attract grow interest advanc biomed applic owe superior catalyt activ photost biocompat howev ration design multifunct nanoplatform integr activ target multimod imag synergist therapi green sustain approach remain highli challeng herein report facil environment benign solvotherm strategi synthesi rutheniumdop cqd nanozym rucqd function as1411 aptam polyethylen glycol peg denot rucqdsas1411peg ecofriendli synthesi avoid toxic reagent harsh condit yield highli uniform biocompat nanozym obtain rucqdsas1411peg exhibit strong nirii absorpt high phototherm convers effici pronounc peroxidasemimick catalyt activ as1411 aptam confer activ tumortarget capabl pegyl enhanc aqueou dispers physiolog stabil vitro vivo studi demonstr rucqdsas1411peg enabl precis photoacoust tumor imag potent tumor ablat nirii laser irradi via synergist phototherm catalyt reactiv oxygen speci ro gener work provid greenengin aptamerguid cqd nanozym platform integr target imag therapeut function offer promis sustain approach precis cancer theranost
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Processed meat (PM) consumption is an established risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC). It has been hypothesized that nitrosyl-heme, formed by the addition of nitrites during meat processing, may enhance the carcinogenic effects of PMs. This study aims to investigate the association between nitrosyl-heme intake and CRC risk within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition(EPIC) study. METHODS: This prospective study included 367,463 participants(70.3% women) from seven countries from the EPIC-study. Dietary data were collected via baseline questionnaires, and nitrosyl-heme exposure was estimated using biochemical data from 52 Spanish PMs, extrapolated to country-specific items. Sex-specific multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios(HRs) and 95% confidence intervals(CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Over a 15-year median follow-up, 5,115 incident CRC cases were identified. Comparing the highest vs. the lowest sex-specific tertile of nitrosyl-heme intake we found no significant association with CRC risk (HR(T3vsT1):1.01;95%CI:0.93-1.09). Subgroup analyses by tumor subtype and interactions with lifestyle factors also showed no associations. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers insights into nitrosyl-heme exposure in European populations but found no link to CRC risk.

cancer,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), often arising from liver fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), remains a leading cause of cancer-related death. Targeting the gut-liver axis offers new therapeutic opportunities to prevent this progression. In this study, colon-targeted chitosan/pectin-based nanoparticles loaded with Astragalus polysaccharide (APs-CS/PT-NPs) were developed to modulate gut microbiota and inhibit liver tumorigenesis. The nanoparticles exhibited robust physicochemical stability and pH-responsive release. In vivo, oral administration of APs-CS/PT-NPs attenuated hepatic steatosis, reduced inflammatory cytokines, and suppressed NAFLD-induced HCC development. 16 S rRNA sequencing revealed restoration of microbial diversity and enhanced production of short-chain fatty acids, especially acetate. Mechanistically, transcriptomic profiling and functional analysis identified acetate as a key mediator, acting via G-protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) to inhibit the NF-kappaB pathway. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of APs-CS/PT-NPs in modulating the gut-liver axis, rebalancing intestinal microbiota, and suppressing pro-inflammatory signaling. This nanoparticle-based strategy offers a promising food-derived preventive intervention for liver fibrosis-HCC transition.",hepatocellular carcinoma hcc often aris liver fibrosi nonalcohol fatti liver diseas nafld remain lead caus cancerrel death target gutliv axi offer new therapeut opportun prevent progress studi colontarget chitosanpectinbas nanoparticl load astragalu polysaccharid apscsptnp develop modul gut microbiota inhibit liver tumorigenesi nanoparticl exhibit robust physicochem stabil phrespons releas vivo oral administr apscsptnp attenu hepat steatosi reduc inflammatori cytokin suppress nafldinduc hcc develop 16 rrna sequenc reveal restor microbi divers enhanc product shortchain fatti acid especi acet mechanist transcriptom profil function analysi identifi acet key mediat act via gproteincoupl receptor 43 gpr43 inhibit nfkappab pathway result highlight therapeut potenti apscsptnp modul gutliv axi rebalanc intestin microbiota suppress proinflammatori signal nanoparticlebas strategi offer promis foodderiv prevent intervent liver fibrosishcc transit
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Three-dimensional (3D) multicellular spheroids mimic tumor architecture, diffusion limits, and drug resistance more effectively than two-dimensional (2D) monolayers. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains highly aggressive, with limited benefits from anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. We investigated the synergistic effects of a novel two-domain soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (2d-sFlt-1), in enhancing paclitaxel efficacy compared with bevacizumab using 3D breast cancer models. METHODS: 3D spheroids derived from triple-negative (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) and luminal (MCF-7) breast cancer cell lines, as well as tumor-endothelial co-culture spheroids, were treated with paclitaxel alone or in combination with 2d-sFlt-1 or bevacizumab. Treatment efficacy was evaluated through drug-sensitivity, proliferation, viability, migration, and morphometric analyses, along with assessments of angiogenesis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling. Statistical significance was determined using non-parametric tests or one- and two-way ANOVA with appropriate multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Transition from 2D monolayer to 3D spheroid culture markedly increased paclitaxel resistance, with IC(5)(0) values elevated by roughly 25-fold. Co-treatment with 2d-sFlt-1 markedly enhanced paclitaxel efficacy, reducing the IC(5)(0) values by approximately tenfold in MDA-MB-231 spheroids and sixfold in MDA-MB-468 spheroids, whereas bevacizumab produced only modest effects. Paclitaxel and 2d-sFlt-1 combination further suppressed spheroid growth and proliferation in both TNBC and luminal breast cancer models. In MDA-MB-231 spheroids, combination therapy reversed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by increasing E-cadherin while downregulating N-cadherin, SNAIL, and TWIST, and further reduced VEGF secretion and angiogenic tube formation. In tumor-endothelial co-cultures, FAK signaling was markedly reduced after combination treatment. Across all models and assays, paclitaxel and 2d-sFlt-1 combination consistently outperformed monotherapy and paclitaxel plus bevacizumab, underscoring its potential as a mechanistically synergistic strategy for overcoming chemoresistance in triple-negative breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: 2d-sFlt-1 enhanced paclitaxel efficacy in physiologically relevant 3D breast cancer models. In MDA-MB-231 spheroids, the combination reduced chemoresistance and invasive growth through coordinated modulation of angiogenesis, EMT, and FAK signaling. In MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 spheroids, it primarily increased cytotoxicity and growth inhibition, indicating a conserved functional benefit across subtypes. These findings provide a rationale for further mechanistic validation and preclinical evaluation of 2d-sFlt-1 plus paclitaxel to define dosing, safety, and translational feasibility in aggressive breast cancers.",background threedimension 3d multicellular spheroid mimic tumor architectur diffus limit drug resist effect twodimension 2d monolay tripleneg breast cancer tnbc remain highli aggress limit benefit antivascular endotheli growth factor vegf therapi investig synergist effect novel twodomain solubl fmslike tyrosin kinase1 2dsflt1 enhanc paclitaxel efficaci compar bevacizumab use 3d breast cancer model method 3d spheroid deriv tripleneg mdamb231 mdamb468 lumin mcf7 breast cancer cell line well tumorendotheli cocultur spheroid treat paclitaxel alon combin 2dsflt1 bevacizumab treatment efficaci evalu drugsensit prolifer viabil migrat morphometr analys along assess angiogenesi epithelialtomesenchym transit emt focal adhes kinas fak signal statist signific determin use nonparametr test one twoway anova appropri multipl comparison result transit 2d monolay 3d spheroid cultur markedli increas paclitaxel resist ic50 valu elev roughli 25fold cotreat 2dsflt1 markedli enhanc paclitaxel efficaci reduc ic50 valu approxim tenfold mdamb231 spheroid sixfold mdamb468 spheroid wherea bevacizumab produc modest effect paclitaxel 2dsflt1 combin suppress spheroid growth prolifer tnbc lumin breast cancer model mdamb231 spheroid combin therapi revers epithelialtomesenchym transit increas ecadherin downregul ncadherin snail twist reduc vegf secret angiogen tube format tumorendotheli cocultur fak signal markedli reduc combin treatment across model assay paclitaxel 2dsflt1 combin consist outperform monotherapi paclitaxel plu bevacizumab underscor potenti mechanist synergist strategi overcom chemoresist tripleneg breast cancer conclus 2dsflt1 enhanc paclitaxel efficaci physiolog relev 3d breast cancer model mdamb231 spheroid combin reduc chemoresist invas growth coordin modul angiogenesi emt fak signal mdamb468 mcf7 spheroid primarili increas cytotox growth inhibit indic conserv function benefit across subtyp find provid rational mechanist valid preclin evalu 2dsflt1 plu paclitaxel defin dose safeti translat feasibl aggress breast cancer
cancer,"PURPOSE: Vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (VABB), widely used for diagnosing breast cancer, is prone to sampling errors that may necessitate repeat procedures and delay treatment. Optically guided VABB using Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) may help address this limitation. METHODS: To this end, an optical introducer (a cut-out 9-gauge hollow tube) was developed and equipped with optical fibers. The tube slides over a standard VABB needle, enabling tis- sue measurements near the biopsy aperture. Ex vivo DRS measurements were performed on lumpectomy specimens from 90 patients using this tube, yielding over 500 measurement loca- tions. Tissue labels were derived through deformable image registration of measurement sites with annotated histology, and label extraction was optimized for larger fiber distances. Machine learning classifiers were trained on the spectral data. RESULTS: Ensemble models achieved up to 94% sensitivity at a 20% tumor threshold and maintained high performance at lower thresholds. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that DRS enables real-time tissue characterization at large fiber distances and may improve biopsy precision. In vivo studies are needed to validate performance and support the integration of DRS into routine VABB diagnostic workflows.",purpos vacuumassist breast biopsi vabb wide use diagnos breast cancer prone sampl error may necessit repeat procedur delay treatment optic guid vabb use diffus reflect spectroscopi dr may help address limit method end optic introduc cutout 9gaug hollow tube develop equip optic fiber tube slide standard vabb needl enabl ti sue measur near biopsi apertur ex vivo dr measur perform lumpectomi specimen 90 patient use tube yield 500 measur loca tion tissu label deriv deform imag registr measur site annot histolog label extract optim larger fiber distanc machin learn classifi train spectral data result ensembl model achiev 94 sensit 20 tumor threshold maintain high perform lower threshold conclus find demonstr dr enabl realtim tissu character larg fiber distanc may improv biopsi precis vivo studi need valid perform support integr dr routin vabb diagnost workflow
cancer,"BACKGROUND: The pancreatic cancer-associated fibroblasts (pCAFs) are among the most active components of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The pCAFs being of mesenchymal stem/stromal cell origin, interact directly with tumor stromal elements, modulate tumor development, and are involved in the formation of pre-metastatic niches that result in unsatisfactory PDAC treatment outcomes. This study aimed to develop an innovative approach for the treatment of desmoplastic pancreatic carcinoma via intracellularly targeted exosomes derived from pCAFs and from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transduced with the suicide gene - yeast cytosine deaminase::uracil phosphoribosyl transferase (yCD::UPRT). METHODS: pCAFs were isolated from four PDAC tumor specimens and MSCs from various tissues. Their transduction with yCD::UPRT gene produce homogenous gene transduced cell populations capable of secreting suicide gene exosomes. Both gene- transduced and naive cells and their exosomes underwent characterization by biophysical, biochemical, microscopic, and LC-MS/MS proteomic methods. Tumor cell-killing functionality was assessed using three pancreatic cancer cell lines. The killing efficacy of combined suicide gene exosomes of MSCs and pCAFs was measured in a mixture of pCAFs and MIA PaCa-2 cells as a simulated desmoplastic pancreatic tumor in vitro. RESULTS: MSCs and pCAFs suicide gene exosomes act as cancer cell-targeted drugs, effectively killing pancreatic carcinoma cells. Exosomes intracellular convert the non-toxic prodrug 5-fluorocytosine into cytotoxic 5-fluorouracil and its metabolites in a dose-dependent manner. In experiments simulating the desmoplastic microenvironment of PDAC, we have found that the suicide gene exosomes from both cells conjugated with prodrug effectively target and inhibit the growth of simulated PDAC. CONCLUSION: Exosomes containing the yCD::UPRT gene from pCAFs and MSCs function as ""Trojan horse"" therapies, efficiently and dose-dependently eliminating pancreatic cancer cells. PDAC environment-targeted yCD::UPRT-gene exosomes from MSCs and pCAFs show promise for a novel PDAC treatment.",background pancreat cancerassoci fibroblast pcaf among activ compon pancreat ductal adenocarcinoma pdac pcaf mesenchym stemstrom cell origin interact directli tumor stromal element modul tumor develop involv format premetastat nich result unsatisfactori pdac treatment outcom studi aim develop innov approach treatment desmoplast pancreat carcinoma via intracellularli target exosom deriv pcaf mesenchym stem cell msc transduc suicid gene yeast cytosin deaminaseuracil phosphoribosyl transferas ycduprt method pcaf isol four pdac tumor specimen msc variou tissu transduct ycduprt gene produc homogen gene transduc cell popul capabl secret suicid gene exosom gene transduc naiv cell exosom underw character biophys biochem microscop lcmsm proteom method tumor cellkil function assess use three pancreat cancer cell line kill efficaci combin suicid gene exosom msc pcaf measur mixtur pcaf mia paca2 cell simul desmoplast pancreat tumor vitro result msc pcaf suicid gene exosom act cancer celltarget drug effect kill pancreat carcinoma cell exosom intracellular convert nontox prodrug 5fluorocytosin cytotox 5fluorouracil metabolit dosedepend manner experi simul desmoplast microenviron pdac found suicid gene exosom cell conjug prodrug effect target inhibit growth simul pdac conclus exosom contain ycduprt gene pcaf msc function trojan hors therapi effici dosedepend elimin pancreat cancer cell pdac environmenttarget ycduprtgen exosom msc pcaf show promis novel pdac treatment
cancer,"KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), due to its evolution of more complex antioxidant metabolic mechanisms, exhibits poorer sensitivity to conventional platinum-based drugs compared to other types of LUAD. Ferroptosis, as a means of inducing cell death in cancer therapy, shows unique features and potential therapeutic effects compared to the conventional form of apoptosis, which is frequently obstructed by drug resistance. In human KRAS-mutant LUAD cell lines and mouse models, we found that the deubiquitinase OTU deubiquitinase 7A (OTUD7A) precisely regulates the lysine demethylase 5B (KDM5B). Inhibition of KDM5B expression increases the H4K20me3 level, which in turn downregulates the expression of transcription factor GABPA associated with mitochondrial function, ultimately promoting the production of more Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) by mitochondria and inducing ferroptosis. Additionally, in in vivo organoid models, cisplatin (CDDP) induced ferroptosis combined with GABPA inhibition demonstrated superior anticancer effects compared to conventional platinum-based drugs. This research identifies new targets and regulatory networks that hold promise for developing ferroptosis-based therapies for KRAS-mutant LUAD.",krasmut lung adenocarcinoma luad due evolut complex antioxid metabol mechan exhibit poorer sensit convent platinumbas drug compar type luad ferroptosi mean induc cell death cancer therapi show uniqu featur potenti therapeut effect compar convent form apoptosi frequent obstruct drug resist human krasmut luad cell line mous model found deubiquitinas otu deubiquitinas 7a otud7a precis regul lysin demethylas 5b kdm5b inhibit kdm5b express increas h4k20me3 level turn downregul express transcript factor gabpa associ mitochondri function ultim promot product reactiv oxygen speci ro mitochondria induc ferroptosi addit vivo organoid model cisplatin cddp induc ferroptosi combin gabpa inhibit demonstr superior anticanc effect compar convent platinumbas drug research identifi new target regulatori network hold promis develop ferroptosisbas therapi krasmut luad
cancer,"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and nanotechnology is reshaping cancer diagnosis and treatment. In this context, intelligent nanoplatforms are multifunctional nanoscale systems designed or optimized with the help of AI, capable of combining tumor sensing, targeted delivery, controlled release, and adaptive response within a single platform. AI can analyze large-scale multi-omics and clinical datasets to support early cancer detection, accurate diagnosis, prognosis assessment, and refinement of personalized treatment strategies, while nanotechnology enables precise tumor targeting and site-specific drug delivery through diverse nanocarriers, thereby reducing systemic toxicity and improving therapeutic efficacy. Their interaction allows more rational nanomedicine design by optimizing key properties such as targeting capability, stability, and responsiveness, and nano-enabled imaging and sensing provide high-resolution data that further enhance model performance.

Although there are numerous analysis methods and graphical approaches used for PRO-CTCAE data, the current PRO literature is limited in unified reporting and graphical approaches as well as public-facing analysis tools. RESULTS: Collaborative efforts from the Standardization Working Group of the National Cancer Institute Cancer Treatment Tolerability Consortium worked to develop the R package, ProAE. Testing and validation of widely used methods were implemented in the R package and deployed to various open-source outlets including the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). CONCLUSION: ProAE is a free and publicly available collection of standardized statistical analysis tools for PRO-CTCAE and other PRO data used in patient care and research. The ProAE package provides oncology researchers with an efficient and modern means to apply the published analysis approaches, including hypothesis testing, descriptive and inferential tables, and longitudinal graphics, without the need for costly software or licensing.",background patientreport symptomat advers event ae increasingli collect oncolog clinic trial character treatment toler inform clinic decis make use patientreport outcom pro version common terminolog criteria advers event proctcaer although numer analysi method graphic approach use proctca data current pro literatur limit unifi report graphic approach well publicfac analysi tool result collabor effort standard work group nation cancer institut cancer treatment toler consortium work develop r packag proae test valid wide use method implement r packag deploy variou opensourc outlet includ comprehens r archiv network cran conclus proae free publicli avail collect standard statist analysi tool proctca pro data use patient care research proae packag provid oncolog research effici modern mean appli publish analysi approach includ hypothesi test descript inferenti tabl longitudin graphic without need costli softwar licens
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and submucosal tunneling endoscopic resection (STER) have become the safe and effective techniques for early-stage esophageal cancer and small-diameter submucosal tumors of the esophagus. Yet, there remains insufficient research on the appropriate fasting period following ESD or STER in patients with early esophageal neoplasms. This study aims to assess the impact of different fasting durations-long versus short-on postoperative complication rates and hospital stay durations. METHODS: Patients with esophageal tumors less than 2 cm in diameter who underwent ESD or STER between 2014 and 2020 in the Department of Gastroenterology at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University were analyzed. RESULTS: In intention to treat (ITT) analysis, 266 patients were part of the long fasting group, and 93 patients were part of the short fasting group. After matching, propensity score matching analysis (PSMA) resulted in 88 matched pairs between short and long fasting group, covariates were well balanced across both groups. Stratified analysis of esophageal ESD or STER indicate that the incidence of Postoperative discomfort and complications did not differ significantly between the two groups(all P > 0.05). And the length of hospital stay remained significantly longer in the long fasting group compared to the short fasting group with esophageal ESD (7.63 +/- 2.56 days vs. 6.52 +/- 2.17 days, P = 0.01) or esophageal STER (7.86 +/- 2.07 days vs. 6.67 +/- 1.90 days, P = 0.037). Supplementary per protocol (PP) analysis also showed similar trends in the incidence of Postoperative adverse events or complications and the hospitalization duration. CONCLUSIONS: For small esophageal tumors (< 2 cm), short fasting after ESD or STER shows similar complication rates to long fasting but significantly shortens hospitalization, Improving its efficiency in postoperative care.",background endoscop submucos dissect esd submucos tunnel endoscop resect ster becom safe effect techniqu earlystag esophag cancer smalldiamet submucos tumor esophagu yet remain insuffici research appropri fast period follow esd ster patient earli esophag neoplasm studi aim assess impact differ fast durationslong versu shorton postop complic rate hospit stay durat method patient esophag tumor less 2 cm diamet underw esd ster 2014 2020 depart gastroenterolog first affili hospit nanchang univers analyz result intent treat itt analysi 266 patient part long fast group 93 patient part short fast group match propens score match analysi psma result 88 match pair short long fast group covari well balanc across group stratifi analysi esophag esd ster indic incid postop discomfort complic differ significantli two groupsal p 005 length hospit stay remain significantli longer long fast group compar short fast group esophag esd 763 256 day vs 652 217 day p 001 esophag ster 786 207 day vs 667 190 day p 0037 supplementari per protocol pp analysi also show similar trend incid postop advers event complic hospit durat conclus small esophag tumor 2 cm short fast esd ster show similar complic rate long fast significantli shorten hospit improv effici postop care
cancer,"PURPOSE: Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) is essential for carcinogenesis and the advancement of cancer, making it a promising therapeutic target in oncology. Nevertheless, comprehensive bioinformatic analyses of TRAP1 across diverse cancer types are limited. Herein, we analyzed TRAP1 across all cancer types, focusing on its expression in relation to prognosis, immune infiltration, and the mammalian target of rapamycin and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. METHODS: We evaluated TRAP1's clinical relevance for prognostic predictions and its association with tumor immunity and metabolism. TRAP1's function in hepatocellular carcinoma cell invasion, migration, and proliferation was examined in vitro using wound healing assays and the cell counting kit-8; apoptosis was examined through reactive oxygen species detection. RESULTS: We found that TRAP1 significantly predicts cancer prognosis and is closely linked to immune and metabolic tumor characteristics. In liver cancer cells, TRAP1 knockdown prevented invasion, migration, and proliferation; increased reactive oxygen species; and promoted apoptosis. CONCLUSION: In summary, this study reveals the critical clinical significance of TRAP1 across multiple cancer types through a pan-cancer analysis. Further in vitro experiments demonstrate that knocking down TRAP1 significantly suppresses malignant phenotypes of tumor cells in hepatocellular carcinoma by inducing oxidative stress and apoptosis. Thus, TRAP1, particularly in liver cancer, represents a highly promising prognostic biomarker and a novel metabolic therapeutic target. These findings provide direction for subsequent research on TRAP1 and strongly support its potential for translational exploration in hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.",purpos tumor necrosi factor receptorassoci protein 1 trap1 essenti carcinogenesi advanc cancer make promis therapeut target oncolog nevertheless comprehens bioinformat analys trap1 across divers cancer type limit herein analyz trap1 across cancer type focus express relat prognosi immun infiltr mammalian target rapamycin receptor tyrosin kinas signal pathway method evalu trap1 clinic relev prognost predict associ tumor immun metabol trap1 function hepatocellular carcinoma cell invas migrat prolifer examin vitro use wound heal assay cell count kit8 apoptosi examin reactiv oxygen speci detect result found trap1 significantli predict cancer prognosi close link immun metabol tumor characterist liver cancer cell trap1 knockdown prevent invas migrat prolifer increas reactiv oxygen speci promot apoptosi conclus summari studi reveal critic clinic signific trap1 across multipl cancer type pancanc analysi vitro experi demonstr knock trap1 significantli suppress malign phenotyp tumor cell hepatocellular carcinoma induc oxid stress apoptosi thu trap1 particularli liver cancer repres highli promis prognost biomark novel metabol therapeut target find provid direct subsequ research trap1 strongli support potenti translat explor hepatocellular carcinoma treatment

In this study, we examined the application of PurIST, a molecular subtyping algorithm for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), across different platforms. We compared PurIST calls between matched samples processed by whole transcriptome and commercial exome capture RNA-seq. In parallel, we compared subtypes between matched samples processed by NanoString and whole transcriptome RNA-seq from the PANCREAS trial (NCT04683315). Between whole transcriptome and exome capture, subtype agreement was 81% with significant increase in basal-like subtype with exome capture. Differences in overall survival in patients with basal-like tumors compared to classical tumors did not reach statistical significance using exome capture (log-rank P = 0.061), whereas with whole transcriptome it was significantly shorter (log-rank P < 0.0001). Subtype agreement between whole transcriptome RNA-seq and NanoString was higher at 95%.

cancer,"Preoperative T staging of gastric cancer is critical for therapeutic stratification, yet conventional contrast-enhanced CT interpretation shows subjectivity and inconsistent reliability. We developed GTRNet, an interpretable end-to-end deep-learning framework that classifies T1-T4 from routine CT without manual segmentation or annotation. In a retrospective multicenter study of 1792 patients, CT images underwent standardized preprocessing and the largest axial tumor slice was used for training; performance was then tested in two independent external cohorts. GTRNet achieved high discrimination (AUC 0.86-0.95) and accuracy (81-85%) in internal and external tests, surpassing radiologists. Grad-CAM heatmaps localized attention to the gastric wall and serosa. Combining a deep-learning rad-score with tumor size, differentiation and Lauren subtype, we constructed a nomogram with good calibration and higher net clinical benefit than conventional approaches.

cancer,"Inverted sinonasal papilloma (ISP) is a benign epithelial neoplasm with potential for malignant transformation into squamous cell carcinoma (ISP-SCC). While high-risk HPV infection has been studied as a possible driver, other factors, including occupational exposures, may play a role. Thirty-two cases (n = 32) of ISP and ISP SCC were retrospectively analysed. These cases had been diagnosed between 2010 and 2022. We assessed their occupational history through the Italian Sino-Nasal Cancer Registry questionnaire and performed p16/p53 immunohistochemistry, HPV DNA and RNA testing. Overall, 41% of ISP and 40% of ISP-SCC cases reported exposure to IARC Group 1-2 A carcinogens, and 69% had a history of smoking. Transcriptionally active HPV was detected in only one case (3.1%). Conventional bivariate analyses did not reveal significant associations between occupational exposure and malignant transformation. However, hierarchical cluster analysis identified three distinct phenotypes. Cluster 1 included predominantly male smokers with high cumulative occupational and non-occupational exposure, with ISP-SCC in 17%. Cluster 2, characterized by the highest occupational exposure and lowest smoking prevalence, consisted exclusively of ISP-SCC cases (100%), suggesting occupational carcinogens as a possible independent driver. Cluster 3 had minimal exposure, inflammatory features, and no malignant transformation. These findings highlight the potential of multidimensional analytical approaches to identify high-risk subgroups and inform targeted preventive and surveillance strategies in exposed populations.",invert sinonas papilloma isp benign epitheli neoplasm potenti malign transform squamou cell carcinoma ispscc highrisk hpv infect studi possibl driver factor includ occup exposur may play role thirtytwo case n 32 isp isp scc retrospect analys case diagnos 2010 2022 assess occup histori italian sinonas cancer registri questionnair perform p16p53 immunohistochemistri hpv dna rna test overal 41 isp 40 ispscc case report exposur iarc group 12 carcinogen 69 histori smoke transcript activ hpv detect one case 31 convent bivari analys reveal signific associ occup exposur malign transform howev hierarch cluster analysi identifi three distinct phenotyp cluster 1 includ predominantli male smoker high cumul occup nonoccup exposur ispscc 17 cluster 2 character highest occup exposur lowest smoke preval consist exclus ispscc case 100 suggest occup carcinogen possibl independ driver cluster 3 minim exposur inflammatori featur malign transform find highlight potenti multidimension analyt approach identifi highrisk subgroup inform target prevent surveil strategi expos popul
cancer,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER-2 amplification, rendering it unresponsive to endocrine and HER2-targeted therapies. GRP78 (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein), a key endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident chaperone involved in protein folding and stress response, has been observed atypically localized on the cell surface of various cancer and stressed cell types, where it engages in non-canonical signaling and cellular functions. Cell surface GRP78 (csGRP78) is preferentially expressed in malignant cells relative to normal tissue, making it an attractive therapeutic target. In this study, we report that over 70% of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells express csGRP78. Interestingly, MDA-MB-231 cells predominantly exhibit a distinct unipolar morphology, with csGRP78 prominently co-localizing with the variant isoform of CD44 (CD44v, containing variable exon 3) at the anterior region of the cell. Co-localizations of csGRP78 and CD44v were also observed in MDA-MB-231 tumor xenografts, supporting its relevance in vivo. Importantly, targeting csGRP78 with the monoclonal antibody 76-E6 downregulated CD44v expression, inhibited Src kinase signaling, disrupted cell morphology, and suppressed cell motility. We further mapped the epitope of GRP78 targeted by 76-E6. Together, our findings identify csGRP78 as a functional regulator of cell morphology and migration at least in part via a csGRP78-CD44v axis and underscore its potential as a therapeutic target in TNBC.",tripleneg breast cancer tnbc character absenc estrogen receptor er progesteron receptor pr her2 amplif render unrespons endocrin her2target therapi grp78 78 kda glucoseregul protein key endoplasm reticulum erresid chaperon involv protein fold stress respons observ atyp local cell surfac variou cancer stress cell type engag noncanon signal cellular function cell surfac grp78 csgrp78 preferenti express malign cell rel normal tissu make attract therapeut target studi report 70 mdamb231 tnbc cell express csgrp78 interestingli mdamb231 cell predominantli exhibit distinct unipolar morpholog csgrp78 promin coloc variant isoform cd44 cd44v contain variabl exon 3 anterior region cell coloc csgrp78 cd44v also observ mdamb231 tumor xenograft support relev vivo importantli target csgrp78 monoclon antibodi 76e6 downregul cd44v express inhibit src kinas signal disrupt cell morpholog suppress cell motil map epitop grp78 target 76e6 togeth find identifi csgrp78 function regul cell morpholog migrat least part via csgrp78cd44v axi underscor potenti therapeut target tnbc
cancer,"Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is generally an incurable neoplasm. A small cohort of patients with HER2-positive MBC, however, achieve such prolonged remission without relapse following anti-HER2 therapy and chemotherapy, that it is speculated they might be cured. The genomes of these patients might provide insights into the underlying mechanisms for their successful treatment. Here, a total of 243 HER2-positive patients diagnosed with MBC between 2000 and 2015 were studied. Of these, 29 patients were identified as exceptional responders (ExR) with an overall survival (OS) > 60 months and no evidence of relapse, 54 patients with an OS > 60 months but who relapsed or developed progressive disease were defined as exceptional survivors (ExS), and 160 patients with an OS < 60 months were identified as short-term responders (STR). Whole-Genome Sequencing and centromere copy number (CCN) analysis was performed on 27 patients (12 ExR; 4 ExS; 11 STR). A significant amplification was observed in the centromeric regions of ExR, exhibiting higher CCN compared to the ExS and STR. Digital PCR validation of chromosome 4 centromere region D4Z1 copy number was not associated with ExR OS. Our results suggest that the amplification of centromere regions are associated with very prolonged remission and survival in patients with HER2-positive MBC.",metastat breast cancer mbc gener incur neoplasm small cohort patient her2posit mbc howev achiev prolong remiss without relaps follow antiher2 therapi chemotherapi specul might cure genom patient might provid insight underli mechan success treatment total 243 her2posit patient diagnos mbc 2000 2015 studi 29 patient identifi except respond exr overal surviv os 60 month evid relaps 54 patient os 60 month relaps develop progress diseas defin except survivor ex 160 patient os 60 month identifi shortterm respond str wholegenom sequenc centromer copi number ccn analysi perform 27 patient 12 exr 4 ex 11 str signific amplif observ centromer region exr exhibit higher ccn compar ex str digit pcr valid chromosom 4 centromer region d4z1 copi number associ exr os result suggest amplif centromer region associ prolong remiss surviv patient her2posit mbc

cancer,"DNA base editors are transformative genome editing tools that enable nucleotide conversions without inducing double-stranded DNA breaks, making them promising for correcting genetic mutations. Current base editors, however, are limited by fixed editing windows and constrained location of deaminases. To address these constraints, we develop a modular system termed Plug-in Base Editor (Plug-in BE), which dynamically programs deaminase positioning via integrating various epitopes and antibody-fused deaminases. This system expands the editing capabilities of base editors by optimizing deaminase's spatial interaction with DNA, leading to improvements in efficiencies, window restrictions, and safety profiles. We validate Plug-in BE's versatility and high fidelity in cancer gene therapy and zebrafish embryo editing, demonstrating its potential as a powerful and adaptable tool for basic research and therapeutic applications. This innovation can generate a series of base editors without extensive protein evolution, positioning Plug-in BE as a significant advancement in the field of genome editing.",dna base editor transform genom edit tool enabl nucleotid convers without induc doublestrand dna break make promis correct genet mutat current base editor howev limit fix edit window constrain locat deaminas address constraint develop modular system term plugin base editor plugin dynam program deaminas posit via integr variou epitop antibodyfus deaminas system expand edit capabl base editor optim deaminas spatial interact dna lead improv effici window restrict safeti profil valid plugin be versatil high fidel cancer gene therapi zebrafish embryo edit demonstr potenti power adapt tool basic research therapeut applic innov gener seri base editor without extens protein evolut posit plugin signific advanc field genom edit
cancer,"This study investigated the role of the mitochondrial protein MRPL17 (mitochondrial ribosomal protein L17) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), exploring its expression profile, clinical significance, and therapeutic potential. Transcriptomic analyses of TCGA and single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed significant upregulation of MRPL17 in LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma) and LUSC (lung squamous cell carcinoma) tumor tissues, particularly within malignant epithelial and proliferating cancer cells. Elevated MRPL17 expression correlated with advanced stages, positive lymph node metastasis, and poorer overall survival. In vitro investigations demonstrated that silencing or knockout of MRPL17 attenuated cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion in NSCLC cells, while promoting apoptosis. Mechanistically, MRPL17 silencing impaired mitochondrial respiratory function, causing reduced oxygen consumption, diminished Complex I activity, and decreased ATP. These impairments were partially reversible by antioxidant treatment or glucose supplementation. Conversely, MRPL17 overexpression enhanced aggressive cellular phenotypes and mitochondrial energetic output. Bioinformatic analysis and subsequent experiments confirmed COX8A as a direct downstream target of MRPL17, mediating its pro-cancerous effects. In vivo, MRPL17 silencing suppressed NSCLC xenograft growth in nude mice, a phenomenon associated with reduced COX8A levels, mitochondrial dysfunction, heightened oxidative stress, and increased apoptosis. Thus, MRPL17 is an important pro-cancerous target in NSCLC, driving malignant progression through the regulation of mitochondrial function and cellular redox balance, with COX8A identified as a key mediator.",studi investig role mitochondri protein mrpl17 mitochondri ribosom protein l17 nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc explor express profil clinic signific therapeut potenti transcriptom analys tcga singlecel rna sequenc data reveal signific upregul mrpl17 luad lung adenocarcinoma lusc lung squamou cell carcinoma tumor tissu particularli within malign epitheli prolifer cancer cell elev mrpl17 express correl advanc stage posit lymph node metastasi poorer overal surviv vitro investig demonstr silenc knockout mrpl17 attenu cell viabil prolifer migrat invas nsclc cell promot apoptosi mechanist mrpl17 silenc impair mitochondri respiratori function caus reduc oxygen consumpt diminish complex activ decreas atp impair partial revers antioxid treatment glucos supplement convers mrpl17 overexpress enhanc aggress cellular phenotyp mitochondri energet output bioinformat analysi subsequ experi confirm cox8a direct downstream target mrpl17 mediat procancer effect vivo mrpl17 silenc suppress nsclc xenograft growth nude mice phenomenon associ reduc cox8a level mitochondri dysfunct heighten oxid stress increas apoptosi thu mrpl17 import procancer target nsclc drive malign progress regul mitochondri function cellular redox balanc cox8a identifi key mediat
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Caregivers' health is a crucial public health concern. Although breast cancer's psychosocial burden extends to offspring caregivers, their trauma narratives and seeking of social support remain understudied, particularly in China. This study aimed to explore how adult offspring caregivers share trauma stories in online support groups (OSGs) and identify how narrative practices may facilitate self-healing. METHODS: We employed a mixed qualitative study approach - using large language models and thematic analysis to examine offspring caregivers' sentiment patterns and narrative characteristics at different treatment stages for the parent for whom they were caring. The sample comprised 705 posts and comments from offspring of breast cancer patients, collected from the Douban OSG ""Having a Breast Cancer Patient in My Family."" RESULTS: At the early stage of treatment, most offspring caregivers of breast cancer patients exhibited negative sentiments. A combination of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments was observed in the middle stage. In the late stage, positive sentiments predominated. Furthermore, we identified three narrative themes aligning with sentiment trajectories among offspring caregivers: collapse, interactive, and constructive narratives. These findings suggest the self-healing function of media-based narratives. We argue that the deeper exploration of online trauma narratives related to breast cancer is necessary for more effectively conceptualizing the role of OSGs in providing health-related support. CONCLUSIONS: Trauma narration of offspring caregivers, particularly in online spaces, is an underexplored, but potentially crucial area. Our study revealed the role of the OSG impact on individual emotional and behavioral experiences that could be integrated into interventions to enhance psychological treatments.",background caregiv health crucial public health concern although breast cancer psychosoci burden extend offspr caregiv trauma narr seek social support remain understudi particularli china studi aim explor adult offspr caregiv share trauma stori onlin support group osg identifi narr practic may facilit selfheal method employ mix qualit studi approach use larg languag model themat analysi examin offspr caregiv sentiment pattern narr characterist differ treatment stage parent care sampl compris 705 post comment offspr breast cancer patient collect douban osg breast cancer patient famili result earli stage treatment offspr caregiv breast cancer patient exhibit neg sentiment combin posit neg neutral sentiment observ middl stage late stage posit sentiment predomin furthermor identifi three narr theme align sentiment trajectori among offspr caregiv collaps interact construct narr find suggest selfheal function mediabas narr argu deeper explor onlin trauma narr relat breast cancer necessari effect conceptu role osg provid healthrel support conclus trauma narrat offspr caregiv particularli onlin space underexplor potenti crucial area studi reveal role osg impact individu emot behavior experi could integr intervent enhanc psycholog treatment

This phase 1b/2 study aimed to evaluate SHR-1701 (an anti-PD-L1/TGF-betaRII fusion protein) plus AG in this population (NCT04624217). In phase 1b part, the recommended dose of SHR-1701 was identified as 30 mg/kg every 3 weeks, when combined with AG. In phase 2 part, the primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). As of Mar 31, 2023, 56 patients were enrolled. Median follow-up was 10.3 months (range, 0.2-24.7). ORR was 32.1% (95% CI, 20.3-46.0). Median progressive-free survival (PFS) was 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.3-6.6), and median overall survival (OS) was 10.3 months (95% CI, 8.8-12.3). Treatment-related adverse events of grade >/=3 were reported in 27 (48.2%) patients, with the most common being decreased neutrophil count. Patients with PD-L1 TPS >/= 1% showed a higher ORR (66.7% vs. 25.0%), as well as extended median PFS (6.3 vs. 5.3 months) and median OS (18.8 vs. 9.9 months). Additionally, reduction of CA19-9 by at least 80% during treatment and pSMAD2/3 staining intensity of 1+ at baseline were potential monitoring tools and predictive biomarkers for better clinical outcomes, respectively. Tumor-specific T-cell infiltration and pancreatic cancer tumor subtypes were associated with anti-tumor response. The interactions within tumor microenvironment were involved disease progression.

cancer,"A central challenge in cancer research is to identify the secreted factors that sustain tumor cell survival. This is best exemplified in Hodgkin lymphoma, where malignant cells constitute a minor fraction of the tumor and rely on signals from the microenvironment for survival. Using genome-wide transcriptional profiling with spatial and single-cell resolution, we show that the neighborhood around malignant cells forms a distinct niche of 31 non-malignant cell types, enriched in helper T cells and myeloid cells, but depleted of plasma cells. Moreover, our spatial analysis nominates IL13 as a candidate survival factor. Recombinant IL13 augments malignant cell growth in vitro, and genome-wide loss-of-function screens across >1000 human cancer cell lines identify IL4R and IL13RA1, heterodimeric components of the IL13 receptor, as uniquely essential in Hodgkin lymphoma. Importantly, blocking antibodies phenocopy genetic inactivation.

cancer,"High salt diet (HSD) is known to reduce cancer growth in some tumor models, which has been attributed to tissue accumulation of sodium that enhances local anti-tumor immunity. Here, we show that a HSD inhibits melanoma growth independent of sodium accumulation and immune cells in skin and lung. Melanoma cells from mice on a HSD upregulated the metabolic inhibitor Tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), causing metabolic shutdown despite nutrient availability. Furthermore, Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), a crucial regulator of melanoma metabolism and differentiation, was upregulated, resulting in enhanced melanogenesis and cell cycle arrest. Thus, a HSD reversed the de-differentiation of melanoma cells and promoted their re-differentiation into a ""normal"" melanocytic state. These findings suggest that the anti-tumor effect of HSD may be tumor-specific and in some cases immune cell-independent.",high salt diet hsd known reduc cancer growth tumor model attribut tissu accumul sodium enhanc local antitumor immun show hsd inhibit melanoma growth independ sodium accumul immun cell skin lung melanoma cell mice hsd upregul metabol inhibitor tuber sclerosi complex 2 tsc2 caus metabol shutdown despit nutrient avail furthermor microphthalmiaassoci transcript factor mitf crucial regul melanoma metabol differenti upregul result enhanc melanogenesi cell cycl arrest thu hsd revers dedifferenti melanoma cell promot redifferenti normal melanocyt state find suggest antitumor effect hsd may tumorspecif case immun cellindepend
cancer,"BACKGROUND: For early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly tumors less than 2 cm in diameter, sublobar resection-including wedge resection and segmentectomy-is often the preferred surgical approach. The difficulty of pulmonary segmentectomy lies in identifying the intersegmental planes. Among all segmental resections, S9 resection is considered one of the most challenging due to the cone-like structure of the S9 segment and its deeply hidden segmental portal. To address this, we designed a modified technique that identifies the S9 segmental plane by temporarily and sequentially occluding A9 + 10 and V10 intraoperatively, thereby avoiding dissection of the S9 segmental hilum. This method, which differs from traditional intersegmental plane identification based on occluding individual segmental arteries or veins, is termed the reverse watershed method. We compared it with the modified inflation-collapse method to explore its advantages and disadvantages in S9 resection. METHODS: We retrospectively collected 87 cases of thoracoscopic S9 resection. Patients were categorized into two groups based on the method used for intersegmental plane identification: the modified inflation-collapse method group and the reverse watershed method group. Various preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative indicators were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients with surgical data were included: 49 operated using the modified inflation-collapse technique and 34 using the reverse watershed method. Preoperative baseline characteristics showed no significant intergroup differences. Intraoperatively, the reverse watershed method group exhibited a reduced mean operative duration (p < 0.01) and diminished intraoperative blood loss (p < 0.01). Postoperatively, this group showed a lower incidence of air leaks, decreased chest tube drainage volume, and reduced pain severity compared to the modified inflation-collapse group. No significant differences were observed in the duration of chest tube retention, length of postoperative hospitalization, or loss of lung function at the 3-month postoperative review. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the modified inflation-collapse technique, the reverse watershed method reduces operative time and intraoperative bleeding in S9 resection, decreases the incidence of postoperative air leaks, and results in comparable preservation of lung function.",background earlystag nonsmallcel lung cancer nsclc particularli tumor less 2 cm diamet sublobar resectioninclud wedg resect segmentectomyi often prefer surgic approach difficulti pulmonari segmentectomi lie identifi intersegment plane among segment resect s9 resect consid one challeng due conelik structur s9 segment deepli hidden segment portal address design modifi techniqu identifi s9 segment plane temporarili sequenti occlud a9 10 v10 intraop therebi avoid dissect s9 segment hilum method differ tradit intersegment plane identif base occlud individu segment arteri vein term revers watersh method compar modifi inflationcollaps method explor advantag disadvantag s9 resect method retrospect collect 87 case thoracoscop s9 resect patient categor two group base method use intersegment plane identif modifi inflationcollaps method group revers watersh method group variou preoper intraop postop indic compar two group result eightyseven patient surgic data includ 49 oper use modifi inflationcollaps techniqu 34 use revers watersh method preoper baselin characterist show signific intergroup differ intraop revers watersh method group exhibit reduc mean oper durat p 001 diminish intraop blood loss p 001 postop group show lower incid air leak decreas chest tube drainag volum reduc pain sever compar modifi inflationcollaps group signific differ observ durat chest tube retent length postop hospit loss lung function 3month postop review conclus compar modifi inflationcollaps techniqu revers watersh method reduc oper time intraop bleed s9 resect decreas incid postop air leak result compar preserv lung function
cancer,"Regulatory factor X6 (RFX6) is defined as the sixth member of the RFX family based on its highly conserved and specific wing-helix DNA-binding domain. Its expression in adults is predominantly localized to pancreatic islets, small intestine, and colon. Extensive research has demonstrated that RFX6 regulates cellular processes, such as pancreatic development, differentiation of islet progenitor cells, and insulin secretion, through the modulation of specific miRNAs (such as miR145 and miR195) and mRNAs (such as Pdx1, Neurod1, GCK, and Abcc8). Hence, mutations and deletions in RFX6 have been linked to the onset of various types of diabetes, including type 2 diabetes, Maturity-onset diabetes of the young, neonatal diabetes mellitus, especially Mitchell-Riley Syndrome (MRS). Specifically, homozygous mutations in RFX6 impede the proper differentiation of pancreatic progenitor cells, leading to inhibition of pancreatic head-tail development and endocrine cell formation, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of MRS. Furthermore, examination of RFX6 target genes reveals a potential association with tumor development, indicating that RFX6 may play a role in cancer progression. Dysregulated expression or mutations of the RFX6 gene in prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, melanoma, and other tumors have garnered significant interest, with studies showing that such alterations affect tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and are correlated with an unfavorable clinical prognosis in patients carrying RFX6 mutations. This review delves into the various functions of RFX6, emphasizing its crucial regulatory roles in pancreatic development, tumorigenesis, and progression. In addition, recent advancements in MRS therapy are outlined, underscoring the importance of RFX6-targeted therapy in MRS and cancer.",regulatori factor x6 rfx6 defin sixth member rfx famili base highli conserv specif winghelix dnabind domain express adult predominantli local pancreat islet small intestin colon extens research demonstr rfx6 regul cellular process pancreat develop differenti islet progenitor cell insulin secret modul specif mirna mir145 mir195 mrna pdx1 neurod1 gck abcc8 henc mutat delet rfx6 link onset variou type diabet includ type 2 diabet maturityonset diabet young neonat diabet mellitu especi mitchellriley syndrom mr specif homozyg mutat rfx6 imped proper differenti pancreat progenitor cell lead inhibit pancreat headtail develop endocrin cell format therebi contribut pathogenesi mr furthermor examin rfx6 target gene reveal potenti associ tumor develop indic rfx6 may play role cancer progress dysregul express mutat rfx6 gene prostat cancer hepatocellular carcinoma gastric cancer melanoma tumor garner signific interest studi show alter affect tumor cell prolifer migrat invas correl unfavor clinic prognosi patient carri rfx6 mutat review delv variou function rfx6 emphas crucial regulatori role pancreat develop tumorigenesi progress addit recent advanc mr therapi outlin underscor import rfx6target therapi mr cancer
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Early and accurate triage of adnexal masses remains challenging due to the heterogeneous presentation of ovarian cancer and the fragmented nature of existing diagnostic tools. While several validated algorithms exist-such as NICE NG12, HSE, IOTA Simple Rules, O-RADS v2022, RMI2, and ROMA-each evaluates different aspects of risk, and none provide an integrated, clinically actionable output. We developed MOCRA (Multivariate Ovarian Cancer Risk Assessment), a deterministic, rule-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) designed to harmonize these tools into a unified risk stratification. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center diagnostic accuracy study included 68 analyzable patients with adnexal masses. MOCRA encoded six validated diagnostic algorithms using object-oriented architecture and combined their outputs through transparent precedence rules to produce a four-level risk classification (low, intermediate, high, indeterminate). Diagnostic performance was evaluated against physician-confirmed outcomes (histopathology or >/= 6-month follow-up). Functional reliability was assessed using predefined test cases, and usability was evaluated by 15 gynecologic oncologists using the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ). RESULTS: Among 68 patients (7 malignant, 61 benign), MOCRA achieved an accuracy of 97.1%, sensitivity 100.0%, specificity 96.7%, F1-score 87.5%, and AUC 0.984. No malignancies occurred in the MOCRA low-risk category. Compared with single algorithms, MOCRA reduced false negatives while maintaining high specificity by cross-validating symptom, biomarker, and ultrasound signals. Functional testing confirmed deterministic and stable performance (mean reliability 4.8/5). Usability ratings were uniformly positive (overall PSSUQ score 4.6/5), with clinicians highlighting the interpretability of the four-tier risk level and the clarity provided by side-by-side algorithm outputs. CONCLUSIONS: MOCRA demonstrates strong diagnostic performance and high clinician usability in this pilot evaluation, suggesting that deterministic integration of multiple validated algorithms can improve consistency and reduce missed high-risk cases. However, the small, single-center dataset-particularly the limited number of malignant cases-warrants cautious interpretation. Larger multicenter and prospective studies with extended follow-up are needed to confirm generalizability and real-world clinical impact.",background earli accur triag adnex mass remain challeng due heterogen present ovarian cancer fragment natur exist diagnost tool sever valid algorithm existsuch nice ng12 hse iota simpl rule orad v2022 rmi2 romaeach evalu differ aspect risk none provid integr clinic action output develop mocra multivari ovarian cancer risk assess determinist rulebas clinic decis support system cdss design harmon tool unifi risk stratif method retrospect singlecent diagnost accuraci studi includ 68 analyz patient adnex mass mocra encod six valid diagnost algorithm use objectori architectur combin output transpar preced rule produc fourlevel risk classif low intermedi high indetermin diagnost perform evalu physicianconfirm outcom histopatholog 6month followup function reliabl assess use predefin test case usabl evalu 15 gynecolog oncologist use poststudi system usabl questionnair pssuq result among 68 patient 7 malign 61 benign mocra achiev accuraci 971 sensit 1000 specif 967 f1score 875 auc 0984 malign occur mocra lowrisk categori compar singl algorithm mocra reduc fals neg maintain high specif crossvalid symptom biomark ultrasound signal function test confirm determinist stabl perform mean reliabl 485 usabl rate uniformli posit overal pssuq score 465 clinician highlight interpret fourtier risk level clariti provid sidebysid algorithm output conclus mocra demonstr strong diagnost perform high clinician usabl pilot evalu suggest determinist integr multipl valid algorithm improv consist reduc miss highrisk case howev small singlecent datasetparticularli limit number malign caseswarr cautiou interpret larger multicent prospect studi extend followup need confirm generaliz realworld clinic impact
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Cancer resistance is one of the major challenges in oncology, often resulting in disease relapse and poor patient outcomes. Within the RNA family, microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate core biological processes and have been recognized also as critical contributors of tumor resistance and therapy failure. Being pivotal, they are increasingly exploited as biomarkers in various settings. Although in silico analyses facilitate miRNAs identification, PCR-based approaches remain essential to validate their expression. Currently, a plethora of well-established, single-target methods exist but multiplex detection from the same input have been only rarely explored. METHODS: We present miRquad, the first-in-class digital PCR (dPCR) TaqMan multiplex clinical research assay for miRNA detection in head and neck (HNC) cancers. Based on a patented prognostic signature including miR-21-5p, miR-96-5p, miR-21-3p and miR-429, the assay would enable simultaneous miRNA analysis via qPCR and dPCR on multiple clinically relevant sample types. RESULTS: We designed and optimized miRquad using both synthetic controls and retrospective patient-derived tissues, sera and saliva. A multicentre ring study was conducted to evaluate assay reliability across different platforms, demonstrating strong correlation with commercial singleplexes, broad applicability, reduced turnaround time (TAT) and cost-effectiveness. Finally, we provide evidence for its potential clinical application to predict disease outcome in HNC, testing miRquad on tumoral and peritumoral tissues, sera and saliva samples collected throughout patient follow up. CONCLUSIONS: The assay overcomes common challenges associated with multiple miRNAs detection, particularly in liquid biopsy samples (e.g., multiple pipetting issues, increased consumption of sample for multiple assessment, extended TAT for complete profiling) and provides robust and accurate detection, demonstrating potential for real-time patient monitoring and prognostication in HNC.",background cancer resist one major challeng oncolog often result diseas relaps poor patient outcom within rna famili microrna mirna regul core biolog process recogn also critic contributor tumor resist therapi failur pivot increasingli exploit biomark variou set although silico analys facilit mirna identif pcrbase approach remain essenti valid express current plethora wellestablish singletarget method exist multiplex detect input rare explor method present mirquad firstinclass digit pcr dpcr taqman multiplex clinic research assay mirna detect head neck hnc cancer base patent prognost signatur includ mir215p mir965p mir213p mir429 assay would enabl simultan mirna analysi via qpcr dpcr multipl clinic relev sampl type result design optim mirquad use synthet control retrospect patientderiv tissu sera saliva multicentr ring studi conduct evalu assay reliabl across differ platform demonstr strong correl commerci singleplex broad applic reduc turnaround time tat costeffect final provid evid potenti clinic applic predict diseas outcom hnc test mirquad tumor peritumor tissu sera saliva sampl collect throughout patient follow conclus assay overcom common challeng associ multipl mirna detect particularli liquid biopsi sampl eg multipl pipet issu increas consumpt sampl multipl assess extend tat complet profil provid robust accur detect demonstr potenti realtim patient monitor prognost hnc

This study aimed to develop an engineered LM strain that induces metabolic reprogramming while enhancing antitumor efficacy through multimodal immune activation. RESULTS: We encapsulated cepharanthine nanoparticles (CEP NPs) into a double-gene attenuated LM strain via electroporation, resulting in the induction of metabolic reprogramming and the emergence of a 'zombie-like' phenotypic state (LM(e)@CEP). This modification disrupted folate metabolism to induce bacterial metabolic dormancy, while triggering a cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) surge that amplified STING-mediated immunogenicity. The CEP payload localized to tumors and exerted dual cytotoxic effects by simultaneously inducing ferroptosis and apoptosis in situ. These direct tumoricidal effects synergize with the immunostimulatory capacity of LM(e)@CEP, effectively modulating the tumor immune microenvironment and exerting robust antitumor effects. Preclinical validation across multiple murine tumor models and ex vivo human tumor specimens confirmed the therapeutic versatility of the platform. Furthermore, results in STING(-/-) mice corroborated that LM(e)@CEP's antitumor effectiveness partly depends on STING pathway activation, and its therapeutic potential may be further enhanced by PD-L1 blockade, thereby mitigating STING-driven immune suppression. CONCLUSIONS: These findings establish metabolic hijacking of bacterial vectors as a paradigm-shifting strategy that integrates direct tumor killing with multimodal immune activation, overcoming key barriers in microbial immunotherapy.",background listeria monocytogen lm hold promis microbi vector cancer immunotherapi yet clinic translat requir precis engin achiev optim balanc attenu immunogen studi aim develop engin lm strain induc metabol reprogram enhanc antitumor efficaci multimod immun activ result encapsul cepharanthin nanoparticl cep np doublegen attenu lm strain via electropor result induct metabol reprogram emerg zombielik phenotyp state lmecep modif disrupt folat metabol induc bacteri metabol dormanc trigger cyclic dinucleotid cdn surg amplifi stingmedi immunogen cep payload local tumor exert dual cytotox effect simultan induc ferroptosi apoptosi situ direct tumoricid effect synerg immunostimulatori capac lmecep effect modul tumor immun microenviron exert robust antitumor effect preclin valid across multipl murin tumor model ex vivo human tumor specimen confirm therapeut versatil platform furthermor result sting mice corrobor lmecep antitumor effect partli depend sting pathway activ therapeut potenti may enhanc pdl1 blockad therebi mitig stingdriven immun suppress conclus find establish metabol hijack bacteri vector paradigmshift strategi integr direct tumor kill multimod immun activ overcom key barrier microbi immunotherapi
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Maintaining quality of life (QoL) for older cancer patients (>/= 70 years) undergoing systemic treatment is challenging. Melatonin supplementation could be a potential strategy. AIMS: The MEQAPAG trial investigated the effects of melatonin supplementation on this specific population's quality of life. METHODS: A multi-centre, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial was implemented. Patients in the interventional arm received a daily dose of melatonin (2 mg/j for 90 days, 1-2 h before bedtime and after a meal) for the first three months of a new systemic treatment line. The primary endpoint was QoL assessment using the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) before and after supplementation. Among the secondary objectives, we evaluated the impact of supplementation on sleep and on urinary melatonin concentrations. We also studied safety and survival. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-three patients were included in the study between July 2015 and January 2021. The trial was prematurely terminated due to futility. Only 61% (n = 59) of the patients were assessable and considered as compliant (i.e., at least two months of supplementation), 30 and 29 were allocated to the experimental and control groups respectively. Median age was 76 years (range [70, 88]). No difference in the QLQ-C30 questionnaire global score was shown. After the supplementation, the aMT6s concentration is 8,4 ng/mg creatinine (range [0.15, 201], IQI [0.99, 105]) in the experimental group. CONCLUSION: In an older cancer population, supplementation with 2 mg melatonin was safe but did not lead to any significant improvement in the global quality of life score on the QLQ-C30 for compliant patients. MEQAPAG trial provides novelty data on urinary aMT6s concentration for older cancer patients.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains one of the deadliest human malignancies, and reliable biomarkers for prognosis and therapeutic stratification are still lacking. PLAAT2 (phospholipase A and acyltransferase 2), an enzyme linked to lipid metabolism, has been implicated in metabolic regulation, but its role in PC is not fully defined. METHODS: Transcriptomic profiles from TCGA-PAAD and independent GEO datasets, together with the corresponding clinical annotations, were analysed to clarify the prognostic relevance and biological roles of PLAAT2. Functional enrichment, immune-cell infiltration, mutational profiles and predicted drug responses were analyzed, and a PLAAT2-related prognostic signature was generated by LASSO-Cox analysis and validated in external GEO datasets. In parallel, PLAAT2 expression was examined in paired PC tissues and matched non-cancerous counterparts by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative RT-PCR. The effects of PLAAT2 silencing on proliferation, migration, invasion and oxaliplatin sensitivity were evaluated in MiaPaCa-2 and CFPAC-1 cells. RESULTS: PLAAT2 levels were substantially higher in PC specimens, and tumours with high PLAAT2 expression tended to exhibit more advanced grade and stage together with poorer survival. High PLAAT2 expression was enriched in lipid-metabolic pathways and linked to an immune-dysregulated microenvironment characterized by reduced CD8(+) T-cell infiltration and increased macrophages. The PLAAT2-high cohort also exhibited a higher frequency of somatic mutations, particularly in KRAS and TP53. An 11-gene PLAAT2-related signature stratified patients into distinct risk groups; high-risk patients showed significantly worse survival and lower predicted sensitivity to irinotecan, olaparib and oxaliplatin, and these findings were consistently validated in independent GEO cohorts. In an institutional cohort of 15 paired clinical samples, IHC and qRT-PCR confirmed higher PLAAT2 expression in tumor tissues than in adjacent non-tumor tissues. Functionally, PLAAT2 knockdown in MiaPaCa-2 and CFPAC-1 cells suppressed cell growth, migration and invasion and significantly enhanced the growth-inhibitory effect of oxaliplatin, accompanied by reduced IC(5)(0) values. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these data support an oncogenic role of PLAAT2 in PC and indicate that PLAAT2 and its associated transcriptional signature may serve as potential biomarkers of prognosis and chemotherapeutic response, as well as candidate targets for precision therapy in PC.",background pancreat cancer pc remain one deadliest human malign reliabl biomark prognosi therapeut stratif still lack plaat2 phospholipas acyltransferas 2 enzym link lipid metabol implic metabol regul role pc fulli defin method transcriptom profil tcgapaad independ geo dataset togeth correspond clinic annot analys clarifi prognost relev biolog role plaat2 function enrich immunecel infiltr mutat profil predict drug respons analyz plaat2rel prognost signatur gener lassocox analysi valid extern geo dataset parallel plaat2 express examin pair pc tissu match noncancer counterpart immunohistochemistri ihc quantit rtpcr effect plaat2 silenc prolifer migrat invas oxaliplatin sensit evalu miapaca2 cfpac1 cell result plaat2 level substanti higher pc specimen tumour high plaat2 express tend exhibit advanc grade stage togeth poorer surviv high plaat2 express enrich lipidmetabol pathway link immunedysregul microenviron character reduc cd8 tcell infiltr increas macrophag plaat2high cohort also exhibit higher frequenc somat mutat particularli kra tp53 11gene plaat2rel signatur stratifi patient distinct risk group highrisk patient show significantli wors surviv lower predict sensit irinotecan olaparib oxaliplatin find consist valid independ geo cohort institut cohort 15 pair clinic sampl ihc qrtpcr confirm higher plaat2 express tumor tissu adjac nontumor tissu function plaat2 knockdown miapaca2 cfpac1 cell suppress cell growth migrat invas significantli enhanc growthinhibitori effect oxaliplatin accompani reduc ic50 valu conclus collect data support oncogen role plaat2 pc indic plaat2 associ transcript signatur may serv potenti biomark prognosi chemotherapeut respons well candid target precis therapi pc
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) represents a novel noninvasive cancer treatment method which uses ultrasound (US) to activate sonosensitizers that produce cytotoxic effects in deep tissues by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). The clinical application of this therapy faces obstacles related to tumor localization and complications in real-time monitoring. METHODS: This systematic review evaluates recent preclinical advances in computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) -guided SDT using nano contrast agents (NCAs). A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from January 2015 to March 2025 identified 26 eligible studies. Data on nanoconstruct design, imaging mechanisms, therapeutic outcomes, and translational potential were extracted and assessed. RESULTS: The majority of studies utilized MRI-guided SDT systems that applied gadolinium or manganese-based NCAs to enhance soft tissue contrast and provide real-time monitoring capabilities. High-atomic-number nanoparticles were used in CT-guided SDT to achieve improved anatomical resolution. The dual-modal platforms showed better tumor visualization along with stronger ROS production and tumor regression while keeping systemic toxicity to a minimum. CONCLUSION: The CT/MRI-guided SDT provides a promising theranostic method to achieve precise and effective cancer treatment. Clinical translation demands standardized protocols alongside clinically relevant models and thorough safety evaluations.",introduct sonodynam therapi sdt repres novel noninvas cancer treatment method use ultrasound us activ sonosensit produc cytotox effect deep tissu gener reactiv oxygen speci ro clinic applic therapi face obstacl relat tumor local complic realtim monitor method systemat review evalu recent preclin advanc comput tomographi ctmagnet reson imag mri guid sdt use nano contrast agent nca comprehens search pubm scopu web scienc googl scholar januari 2015 march 2025 identifi 26 elig studi data nanoconstruct design imag mechan therapeut outcom translat potenti extract assess result major studi util mriguid sdt system appli gadolinium manganesebas nca enhanc soft tissu contrast provid realtim monitor capabl highatomicnumb nanoparticl use ctguid sdt achiev improv anatom resolut dualmod platform show better tumor visual along stronger ro product tumor regress keep system toxic minimum conclus ctmriguid sdt provid promis theranost method achiev precis effect cancer treatment clinic translat demand standard protocol alongsid clinic relev model thorough safeti evalu
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Identifying biomarkers associated with pancreatic cancer (PC) development could facilitate early intervention and improve outcomes. METHODS: This study enrolled 206,363 participants, with 854 incident cases of PC were identified during follow-up. 168 metabolic biomarkers were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and the polygenic risk score (PRS) for PC constructed by 44 single nucleotide polymorphisms was calculated. Multivariate Cox regression analysis and multiple hypothesis testing were employed to evaluate the association between metabolites and PC risk. Stratified analyses and interaction tests were conducted to explore the effects of metabolites under different genetic backgrounds and lifestyle factors. RESULTS: After correction for multiple hypothesis testing, only plasma glycine levels showed a significant inverse correlation with PC risk (FDR-corrected P-value <0.05). High glycine levels were associated with a 21.4 % reduction in PC risk compared to low levels (HR: 0.786, 95 % CI: 0.657-0.940). PRS was positively associated with PC risk, with high PRS participants showing a 2.871-fold increased risk (95 % CI: 2.382-3.460). Glycine's protective effects were more pronounced in low PRS participants and never smokers. High glycine and low PRS participants demonstrated a 72.3 % reduction in PC risk compared to low glycine and high PRS participants (HR: 0.277, 95 % CI: 0.197-0.389). Notably, even among participants with the highest PRS, baseline plasma glycine levels were still significantly inversely associated with future PC risk. CONCLUSION: Higher circulating glycine levels are associated with a reduced risk of PC, even in individuals with the highest genetic susceptibility. These findings suggest that higher circulating glycine levels may hold potential for PC prevention strategies, warranting further experimental validation of glycine supplementation in prospective trials.",background identifi biomark associ pancreat cancer pc develop could facilit earli intervent improv outcom method studi enrol 206363 particip 854 incid case pc identifi followup 168 metabol biomark measur nuclear magnet reson spectroscopi polygen risk score pr pc construct 44 singl nucleotid polymorph calcul multivari cox regress analysi multipl hypothesi test employ evalu associ metabolit pc risk stratifi analys interact test conduct explor effect metabolit differ genet background lifestyl factor result correct multipl hypothesi test plasma glycin level show signific invers correl pc risk fdrcorrect pvalu 005 high glycin level associ 214 reduct pc risk compar low level hr 0786 95 ci 06570940 pr posit associ pc risk high pr particip show 2871fold increas risk 95 ci 23823460 glycin protect effect pronounc low pr particip never smoker high glycin low pr particip demonstr 723 reduct pc risk compar low glycin high pr particip hr 0277 95 ci 01970389 notabl even among particip highest pr baselin plasma glycin level still significantli invers associ futur pc risk conclus higher circul glycin level associ reduc risk pc even individu highest genet suscept find suggest higher circul glycin level may hold potenti pc prevent strategi warrant experiment valid glycin supplement prospect trial
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Staging laparoscopy (SL) is performed to detect occult metastases in patients with localized pancreatic cancer. However, current guideline recommendations vary widely on routinely performing SL. This global survey investigated use and indications of SL. METHODS: An online survey was sent to members of nine international societies and working groups. Information was obtained about SL use, indications SL and adjunct diagnostic modalities across four clinical scenarios. RESULTS: Among 617 responding surgeons (76 countries, six continents), 82% used SL which varied between regions (Americas 90%, Asia 85%, Oceania 81%, Europe 76%, Africa 59%; P < 0.050). Most perform SL during the same session as the scheduled laparotomy (63-79%). A SL was mainly performed at the time of upfront surgery (71%), after (60%) or before (37%) neoadjuvant/induction therapy, and before radiotherapy (31%). SL was mainly performed in selected patients, either based on indeterminate/suspicious lesions on cross-sectional imaging (78-87%), resectability status (54-64%), and/or elevated CA19-9 level (60-69%). Most common used adjuncts were cytological lavage (37-55%) and intra-abdominal liver ultrasonography (36-50%). CONCLUSION: Despite considerable global variability, SL is widely used to detect occult metastases in pancreatic cancer, mainly in high-risk patients and often during the scheduled laparotomy. The observed variability highlights the need for more evidence leading to stronger guideline recommendations.",background stage laparoscopi sl perform detect occult metastas patient local pancreat cancer howev current guidelin recommend vari wide routin perform sl global survey investig use indic sl method onlin survey sent member nine intern societi work group inform obtain sl use indic sl adjunct diagnost modal across four clinic scenario result among 617 respond surgeon 76 countri six contin 82 use sl vari region america 90 asia 85 oceania 81 europ 76 africa 59 p 0050 perform sl session schedul laparotomi 6379 sl mainli perform time upfront surgeri 71 60 37 neoadjuvantinduct therapi radiotherapi 31 sl mainli perform select patient either base indeterminatesuspici lesion crosssect imag 7887 resect statu 5464 andor elev ca199 level 6069 common use adjunct cytolog lavag 3755 intraabdomin liver ultrasonographi 3650 conclus despit consider global variabl sl wide use detect occult metastas pancreat cancer mainli highrisk patient often schedul laparotomi observ variabl highlight need evid lead stronger guidelin recommend
cancer,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Intravesical recurrence after induction bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy is common in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), but longitudinal, real-world data using contemporary definitions of the BCG-exposed (BCG-E) phenotype remain limited, which constrains trial design. We assessed long-term clinical outcomes and clinical trajectories for a large BCG-exposed cohort treated at a single tertiary care center to establish pragmatic benchmarks to inform patient counseling, surveillance strategies, and the design and interpretation of bladder-sparing studies. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study for adults with histologically confirmed high-grade NMIBC treated with intravesical BCG at Moffitt Cancer Center between 1988 and 2024. Relevant clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records into a prespecified database, including detailed BCG doses and timing and features of each recurrence episode. Initial management followed contemporary standards, with subsequent intravesical therapy or radical cystectomy (RC) after shared decision-making. Patients were classified as BCG-unresponsive (BCG-UR) or BCG-E, with BCG adequacy defined as previously published. Time-to-event endpoints were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models; baseline characteristics were compared using Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Of 1076 NMIBC patients treated with BCG, 470 were classifiable: 245 (52.1%) were BCG-E, of whom 173 (70.6%) were resistant and 72 (29.4%) experienced delayed relapse, and 225 (47.9%) were BCG-UR. In the BCG-E group, 50.2% experienced recurrence and 15.5% experienced progression; median recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 27.2 mo. The 5-yr survival rate estimates were 32.25% for RFS, 79.3% for progression-free survival (PFS), 84.5% for metastasis-free survival (MFS), and 65.0% for overall survival (OS). Recurrence was associated with worse PFS (p < 0.001) and MFS (p = 0.03), but not OS (p = 0.2). RC was performed in 45 patients (18.4%). No consistent survival differences were observed across salvage therapies (62.0% BCG, 18.4% gemcitabine + docetaxel, 5.3% single-agent chemotherapy, 1.2% trials, 13% surveillance),. Multivariable OS estimates were computed. Addition of recurrence to the model did not improve discrimination; age and performance status were the strongest predictors of OS. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: We present comprehensive outcomes for and an in-depth characterization of clinical trajectories in BCG-E NMIBC, for which salvage intravesical BCG is predominant and oncologic results are durable. These data provide pragmatic benchmarks for the interpretation and design of bladder-sparing trials in this setting.",background object intraves recurr induct bacillu calmetteguerin bcg therapi common nonmuscleinvas bladder cancer nmibc longitudin realworld data use contemporari definit bcgexpos bcge phenotyp remain limit constrain trial design assess longterm clinic outcom clinic trajectori larg bcgexpos cohort treat singl tertiari care center establish pragmat benchmark inform patient counsel surveil strategi design interpret bladderspar studi method conduct retrospect cohort studi adult histolog confirm highgrad nmibc treat intraves bcg moffitt cancer center 1988 2024 relev clinic data extract electron medic record prespecifi databas includ detail bcg dose time featur recurr episod initi manag follow contemporari standard subsequ intraves therapi radic cystectomi rc share decisionmak patient classifi bcgunrespons bcgur bcge bcg adequaci defin previous publish timetoev endpoint analyz use kaplanmei estim multivari cox proportionalhazard model baselin characterist compar use fisher exact wilcoxon ranksum test key find limit 1076 nmibc patient treat bcg 470 classifi 245 521 bcge 173 706 resist 72 294 experienc delay relaps 225 479 bcgur bcge group 502 experienc recurr 155 experienc progress median recurrencefre surviv rf 272 mo 5yr surviv rate estim 3225 rf 793 progressionfre surviv pf 845 metastasisfre surviv mf 650 overal surviv os recurr associ wors pf p 0001 mf p 003 os p 02 rc perform 45 patient 184 consist surviv differ observ across salvag therapi 620 bcg 184 gemcitabin docetaxel 53 singleag chemotherapi 12 trial 13 surveil multivari os estim comput addit recurr model improv discrimin age perform statu strongest predictor os conclus clinic implic present comprehens outcom indepth character clinic trajectori bcge nmibc salvag intraves bcg predomin oncolog result durabl data provid pragmat benchmark interpret design bladderspar trial set
cancer,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is widely used for localised prostate cancer (PC). As surgical techniques and oncological outcomes have matured, attention has increasingly turned to patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and experience measures (PREMs), driven not only by interest in functional recovery but also by broader health care trends, including shared decision-making, patient empowerment, and value-based care models. Digital health platforms may facilitate this evolution, yet real-world evidence on their feasibility and impact is limited. Our objective was to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and clinical relevance of digital telemonitoring using a certified mobile health application after RARP. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multicentre cohort study involving 465 patients undergoing RARP across 32 French centres. All used the Betty digital health platform for perioperative monitoring. The primary outcome was patient-reported satisfaction with perioperative care. Secondary outcomes were pain trajectories, analgesic use, urinary continence, erectile function, and correlations between satisfaction and recovery endpoints. PROM data were collected preoperatively and up to 6 mo postoperatively. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: The questionnaire completion rate at 6 wk was 86%. Satisfaction was high (median score 9-10), and pain and analgesic use declined steadily over 30 d. The pad-free rate was 59% at 6 wk and 78% at 6 mo. International Index of Erectile Function-5 scores remained low (median 3, interquartile range 1-5 at 6 mo). Satisfaction was correlated with lower pain at postoperative day 7 (r = -0.391, p = 0.001), lower incontinence scores (r = -0.324, p = 0.009), and less impact of incontinence (r = -0.420, p = 0.002). The main limitations are the inclusion of only app users and the absence of nerve-sparing data. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Certified digital telemonitoring after RARP is feasible, well accepted, and linked to high satisfaction. Early pain and continence recovery influence the patient experience. These results support the integration of structured PROM/PREM tracking into standard pathways for real-time monitoring and patient-centred care.",background object robotassist radic prostatectomi rarp wide use localis prostat cancer pc surgic techniqu oncolog outcom matur attent increasingli turn patientreport outcom measur prom experi measur prem driven interest function recoveri also broader health care trend includ share decisionmak patient empower valuebas care model digit health platform may facilit evolut yet realworld evid feasibl impact limit object assess accept feasibl clinic relev digit telemonitor use certifi mobil health applic rarp method conduct prospect multicentr cohort studi involv 465 patient undergo rarp across 32 french centr use betti digit health platform periop monitor primari outcom patientreport satisfact periop care secondari outcom pain trajectori analges use urinari contin erectil function correl satisfact recoveri endpoint prom data collect preoper 6 mo postop key find limit questionnair complet rate 6 wk 86 satisfact high median score 910 pain analges use declin steadili 30 padfre rate 59 6 wk 78 6 mo intern index erectil function5 score remain low median 3 interquartil rang 15 6 mo satisfact correl lower pain postop day 7 r 0391 p 0001 lower incontin score r 0324 p 0009 less impact incontin r 0420 p 0002 main limit inclus app user absenc nervespar data conclus clinic implic certifi digit telemonitor rarp feasibl well accept link high satisfact earli pain contin recoveri influenc patient experi result support integr structur promprem track standard pathway realtim monitor patientcentr care
cancer,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bladder cancer is the most common tumor of the urinary tract and the ninth most common cancer worldwide. Our objective was to describe and interpret current geographic variations in bladder cancer incidence and mortality rates using updated national estimates and recorded data from population-based cancer registries alongside national vital statistics. METHODS: The bladder cancer incidence and mortality for 185 countries by sex were obtained from GLOBOCAN (International Agency for Research on Cancer) for the year 2022. Recorded incidence and mortality data were retrieved from national or subnational population-based cancer registries included in the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents series and the World Health Organization database, respectively. Corresponding age-standardized rates (ASRs) per 100000 person-years were calculated using direct standardization (world standard), and temporal trends of ASRs by calendar period and sex are presented by country, with the direction and magnitude of recent trends quantified using the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC). KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: In 2022, an estimated 614298 new cases of bladder cancer and 220596 deaths occurred worldwide, with approximately 75% of the burden observed in males. Urothelial and squamous cell carcinomas were the predominant histological subtypes across all regions. Incidence and mortality rates varied substantially across regions and countries, with the highest rates reported in Europe, particularly in southern (ASR: 28.7) and northern (20.4) regions, and elevated rates were also seen in North America (18.0), Northern Africa (16.3), and Western Asia (15.2). Despite lower age-standardized rates, Eastern Asia reported the highest absolute numbers due to its large population. Temporal trends indicate a stabilizing or declining incidence in many high-income countries. Mortality rates have overall declined across many populations, for example, in Australia (EAPC in male: -2.6; female: -2.3), the Netherlands (male: 2.9; female: -1.6), and the USA (male: -1.3; female: -1.0). Interpretation of bladder cancer incidence patterns and trends requires caution given possible variations in cancer registration practice, notably as to whether noninvasive tumors are included in reporting. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Bladder cancer continues to pose a significant global health challenge, with marked geographic and sex-based disparities in the incidence and mortality. While encouraging declines in rates are observed in many high-income countries, the burden remains substantial in these regions and rates are rising in some settings. Tobacco smoking remains the predominant risk factor, with historical and current prevalence patterns aligned closely with disease trends. However, in Northern Africa, schistosomiasis contributes to an elevated incidence and a distinct histological profile. Interpretation of these patterns is complex given the potential variations in registration practice, with respect to reporting of noninvasive tumors.",background object bladder cancer common tumor urinari tract ninth common cancer worldwid object describ interpret current geograph variat bladder cancer incid mortal rate use updat nation estim record data populationbas cancer registri alongsid nation vital statist method bladder cancer incid mortal 185 countri sex obtain globocan intern agenc research cancer year 2022 record incid mortal data retriev nation subnat populationbas cancer registri includ cancer incid five contin seri world health organ databas respect correspond agestandard rate asr per 100000 personyear calcul use direct standard world standard tempor trend asr calendar period sex present countri direct magnitud recent trend quantifi use estim annual percentag chang eapc key find limit 2022 estim 614298 new case bladder cancer 220596 death occur worldwid approxim 75 burden observ male urotheli squamou cell carcinoma predomin histolog subtyp across region incid mortal rate vari substanti across region countri highest rate report europ particularli southern asr 287 northern 204 region elev rate also seen north america 180 northern africa 163 western asia 152 despit lower agestandard rate eastern asia report highest absolut number due larg popul tempor trend indic stabil declin incid mani highincom countri mortal rate overal declin across mani popul exampl australia eapc male 26 femal 23 netherland male 29 femal 16 usa male 13 femal 10 interpret bladder cancer incid pattern trend requir caution given possibl variat cancer registr practic notabl whether noninvas tumor includ report conclus clinic implic bladder cancer continu pose signific global health challeng mark geograph sexbas dispar incid mortal encourag declin rate observ mani highincom countri burden remain substanti region rate rise set tobacco smoke remain predomin risk factor histor current preval pattern align close diseas trend howev northern africa schistosomiasi contribut elev incid distinct histolog profil interpret pattern complex given potenti variat registr practic respect report noninvas tumor
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Tumor micronecrosis is a feature of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and might mirror tumor characteristics and patient prognosis. However, the specific influence of tumor micronecrosis on the recurrence patterns of HCC remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of tumor micronecrosis on HCC recurrence patterns, particularly examining any changes after liver resection. METHODS: A cohort of 938 patients with primary HCC who underwent R0 liver resection between June 2014 and October 2019 were included in the study. A second R0 resection was performed in 340 patients with tumor recurrence between November 2014 and October 2021. Tumor micronecrosis was evaluated for primary (938 cases) and recurrent (340 cases) tumors. The recurrence pattern and prognosis were analyzed, and independent prognostic factors were identified using Cox regression analysis. Nomograms were then constructed to predict tumor recurrence and prognosis after liver resection. RESULTS: HCC recurrence was observed in 400 (42.6%) patients during the follow-up period. Tumor micronecrosis independently affected recurrence-free survival (P = 0.002). Among micronecrosis (+) patients, a higher extrahepatic recurrence, multiple tumors, elevated albumin-bilirubin grade, advanced Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage, and increased alpha-fetoprotein level were observed. Additionally, more micronecrosis (-) patients underwent positive treatments after recurrence (P = 0.017), leading to a superior post-recurrence prognosis in this group (P < 0.001). Nearly half of the recurrent HCCs displayed changes in tumor micronecrosis scores. The presence of micronecrosis in primary lesions was significantly associated with poor patient survival after recurrence (P = 0.006), whereas no significant association was observed in patients with recurrent lesions after second R0 resection (P = 0.138). Furthermore, early recurrence, multinodular recurrence, intrahepatic and extrahepatic recurrent tumors, and the treatment modality were identified as independent prognostic factors. The developed nomogram for patient survival achieved a concordance index of 0.753. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HCC displaying tumor micronecrosis experienced increased recurrent risks and more aggressive recurrent patterns, and encountered poorer prognosis compared to those without micronecrosis.

cancer,"Pancreatic cancer, mainly pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), is aggressive with poor prognosis. Because its clinical manifestations appear at advanced stages, only less than 20 % of patients with PDAC can undergo radical surgery. Chemotherapy, with strong toxic side effects, remains the main therapy. Therefore, developing more effective strategies for PDAC is warranted. Because of its heterogeneity and highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), the discovery of new drug targets and development of new therapeutic modalities for PDAC remain difficult. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)-which have demonstrated efficacy against various types of cancers-improve the antitumor effects of a drug by enhancing tumor targeting, reducing toxic side effects, and increasing TME interactions via antigen presentation regulation and immunosuppressive cell inhibition. Here, we summarized the effects of ADCs on TME of PDAC, as well as the future research prospects.",pancreat cancer mainli pancreat ductal adenocarcinoma pdac aggress poor prognosi clinic manifest appear advanc stage less 20 patient pdac undergo radic surgeri chemotherapi strong toxic side effect remain main therapi therefor develop effect strategi pdac warrant heterogen highli immunosuppress tumor microenviron tme discoveri new drug target develop new therapeut modal pdac remain difficult antibodydrug conjug adcswhich demonstr efficaci variou type cancersimprov antitumor effect drug enhanc tumor target reduc toxic side effect increas tme interact via antigen present regul immunosuppress cell inhibit summar effect adc tme pdac well futur research prospect
cancer,"T cells have traditionally been characterized as autonomous killers that eliminate malignant cells through single-cell cytotoxicity. However, recent findings reveal that tumor-reactive T cells frequently form tightly bound clusters on the tumor surface, functioning as cooperative hyper-effector units. These clusters establish stable and reinforced immune synapses, sustain prolonged engagement with tumor targets, and coordinate the delivery of perforin, granzymes, and proinflammatory cytokines. As a result, they exhibit markedly enhanced tumor-killing capacity compared with unbound T cells in both ex vivo assays and murine models. This discovery introduces an essential spatial and mechanical dimension to cancer immunology and challenges the prevailing assumption that molecular phenotype alone defines T-cell efficacy. The implications are substantial, extending to tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy optimization, the refinement of immunotherapy biomarkers, and the engineering of next-generation CAR-T and CAR-NK platforms. Enriching or mimicking the behavior of cluster-forming T cells may accelerate clinical responses and overcome barriers associated with solid tumors. Collectively, these insights reposition T-cell clustering as a fundamental determinant of effective antitumor immunity.",cell tradit character autonom killer elimin malign cell singlecel cytotox howev recent find reveal tumorreact cell frequent form tightli bound cluster tumor surfac function cooper hypereffector unit cluster establish stabl reinforc immun synaps sustain prolong engag tumor target coordin deliveri perforin granzym proinflammatori cytokin result exhibit markedli enhanc tumorkil capac compar unbound cell ex vivo assay murin model discoveri introduc essenti spatial mechan dimens cancer immunolog challeng prevail assumpt molecular phenotyp alon defin tcell efficaci implic substanti extend tumorinfiltr lymphocyt til therapi optim refin immunotherapi biomark engin nextgener cart carnk platform enrich mimick behavior clusterform cell may acceler clinic respons overcom barrier associ solid tumor collect insight reposit tcell cluster fundament determin effect antitumor immun

cancer,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection remains highly prevalent in Mexico and worldwide. In response to the advances in diagnosis, treatment, and epidemiologic surveillance, the Asociacion Mexicana de Gastroenterologia, through a multidisciplinary panel of experts, developed the ""Fifth Mexican Consensus on H. pylori"" in 2025, providing 38 evidence-based recommendations tailored to the Mexican context. The document highlights the establishment of the Hp-MexReg national registry and its collaboration with Hp-LatamReg and HpRESLA projects, enabling the collection of local data on eradication rates and antimicrobial resistance. The expert group reaffirms the high prevalence of H. pylori in Mexico (70.5%) related to social and sanitation factors, as well as the increase of antibiotic-resistant strains, particularly to clarithromycin and levofloxacin. Regarding diagnosis, the 13C-urea breath test is prioritized as the first-line noninvasive method and eradication of the bacterium should be confirmed at least four weeks after treatment. Regarding treatment, quadruple therapies, with or without bismuth, are recommended over standard triple therapy, and potassium-competitive acid blockers are endorsed as an effective alternative to high-dose proton pump inhibitors. H. pylori eradication is strongly recommended, with emphasis on the clinical scenarios in which it is indicated. The present consensus underscores the need to continue conducting national studies that enable strategies to be adapted to Mexico's epidemiologic reality.",helicobact pylori h pylori infect remain highli preval mexico worldwid respons advanc diagnosi treatment epidemiolog surveil asociacion mexicana de gastroenterologia multidisciplinari panel expert develop fifth mexican consensu h pylori 2025 provid 38 evidencebas recommend tailor mexican context document highlight establish hpmexreg nation registri collabor hplatamreg hpresla project enabl collect local data erad rate antimicrobi resist expert group reaffirm high preval h pylori mexico 705 relat social sanit factor well increas antibioticresist strain particularli clarithromycin levofloxacin regard diagnosi 13curea breath test priorit firstlin noninvas method erad bacterium confirm least four week treatment regard treatment quadrupl therapi without bismuth recommend standard tripl therapi potassiumcompetit acid blocker endors effect altern highdos proton pump inhibitor h pylori erad strongli recommend emphasi clinic scenario indic present consensu underscor need continu conduct nation studi enabl strategi adapt mexico epidemiolog realiti
cancer,"QUESTION: How effective is a telerehabilitation program in reducing reports of pelvic floor dysfunction in women after gynaecological cancer treatment? DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial with blinded assessors, concealed allocation and intention-to-treat analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-eight women reporting urinary incontinence (UI) after treatment for gynaecological cancer. INTERVENTIONS: Experimental group participants were allocated to undertake telerehabilitation sessions including pelvic floor muscle training once a week for 12 weeks. The control group received usual care. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the prevalence of UI on the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI-SF). The secondary outcomes were: the impact of UI on quality of life (ICIQ-UI-SF), sexual function (Female Sexual Function Index), dyspareunia (numerical assessment scale), self-esteem (Rosenberg), pain (numerical assessment scale), faecal incontinence, stool consistency, vaginal stenosis, quality of life (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire) and level of physical activity. After 12 weeks, the telerehab group also responded about treatment satisfaction, adherence and system usability. RESULTS: After 12 weeks, the experimental group had better outcomes than the control group in several areas: prevalence of UI (RD -0.45, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.23); total ICIQ-UI-SF score (MD -9.5, 95% CI -11.8 to -7.1); pelvic pain (MD -3.1, 95% CI -4.7 to -1.4); self-esteem (MD 2.9, 95% CI 0.7 to 5.1); and measures of vaginal stenosis and quality of life. CONCLUSION: A 12-week telerehabilitation program was effective in reducing reports of UI, severity of UI, pelvic pain and dyspareunia in women after the treatment of gynaecological cancer.

cancer,"PURPOSE: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to enhance supportive care for cancer survivors from diagnosis through treatment and into survivorship. This study aimed to provide an overview of available evidence on AI applications in supportive care for individuals with colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: This scoping review was conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines. Studies published between 2014 and 2025 were retrieved from six databases: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO, using a combination of search terms relevant to ""colorectal cancer,"" ""artificial intelligence,"" and ""supportive care."" Data on study characteristics, participants, settings, types of AI technologies, and supportive care dimensions were extracted for analysis. RESULTS: Out of 1,792 articles, 40 were identified as eligible for inclusion in this scoping review. AI applications for CRC supportive care are primarily in early development, focusing on machine learning-based prediction models that provide informational support for post-surgical side effects. The use of AI for physical support in symptom management and emotional support during cancer treatment and beyond was limited. CONCLUSION: Implementing AI technology offers an opportunity to enhance supportive care for patients with CRC. This study suggests that current AI applications for CRC supportive care primarily focus on informational support, underscoring the need for further development of AI to provide comprehensive support, including psychological, social, spiritual, and practical aspects.

cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer, one of the most prevalent cancers among women, not only results in significant physical changes but also causes considerable emotional distress and disruptions in social roles and relationships. While depression is the most commonly observed psychiatric disorder in cancer patients, there is a lack of sufficient research on the effectiveness, potential drug interactions, and side effects of antidepressants in this population. This gap underscores the increasing need for non-pharmacological approaches, such as psychotherapy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) in addressing psychosocial challenges faced by breast cancer patients. METHODS: This systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42024576746). A systematic literature search was conducted across five databases: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Ovid MEDLINE. The review was carried out according to PRISMA guidelines. Study selection and data extraction were independently performed by two researchers using the Covidence platform. Disagreements were resolved through discussion to reach consensus. RESULTS: Four studies (two randomized controlled trials [RCTs], two pilots) met inclusion criteria. IPT significantly reduced depression, anxiety, and psychological distress, with some studies also reporting improvements in quality of life. One study showed strong effect sizes (Cohen's d > 1.0) for depression. Telephone-based IPT was feasible and beneficial. Findings support IPT as an effective psychosocial intervention for breast cancer patients. CONCLUSION: IPT appears to be an effective intervention for reducing anxiety and depression and enhancing quality of life in patients with breast cancer. However, further high-quality, large-scale RCTs are needed to strengthen the evidence base and confirm its clinical utility.",object breast cancer one preval cancer among women result signific physic chang also caus consider emot distress disrupt social role relationship depress commonli observ psychiatr disord cancer patient lack suffici research effect potenti drug interact side effect antidepress popul gap underscor increas need nonpharmacolog approach psychotherapi therefor aim studi assess effect interperson psychotherapi ipt address psychosoci challeng face breast cancer patient method systemat review regist prospero databas crd42024576746 systemat literatur search conduct across five databas cochran librari pubm web scienc scopu ovid medlin review carri accord prisma guidelin studi select data extract independ perform two research use covid platform disagr resolv discuss reach consensu result four studi two random control trial rct two pilot met inclus criteria ipt significantli reduc depress anxieti psycholog distress studi also report improv qualiti life one studi show strong effect size cohen 10 depress telephonebas ipt feasibl benefici find support ipt effect psychosoci intervent breast cancer patient conclus ipt appear effect intervent reduc anxieti depress enhanc qualiti life patient breast cancer howev highqual largescal rct need strengthen evid base confirm clinic util
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Unless greater awareness inspires action, lung cancer will become the next global public health emergency. Despite improvements in screening, diagnosis, and treatments, more must be done because global incidence continues to increase. Concerted action must address the burden both between and within countries. Inequalities result from the uneven distribution of resources while inequities result from differences in prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment. METHOD: Participants in the 9th International Lung Cancer Network conference (Athens, June 2023) received an advanced draft of the declaration with a confidentiality notice by email upon completion of online registration. They were invited to provide comments and suggestions up to seven days before the meeting. All contributions were reviewed by the authors and incorporated into the final version circulated the day before the meeting began. Although not a formal Delphi-style process, this approach prioritized inclusivity, transparency, and broad endorsement. Outreach extended beyond onsite attendees, ensuring diverse perspectives and representation. This process complements methodological consensus approaches by uniting stakeholders around shared policy goals. RESULTS: At the 9th International Lung Cancer Network conference, participants were invited to sign the final declaration, and 785 did so. Since then, 20 organizations worldwide have formally endorsed the Consensus Statement, and support continues to grow. The inclusive design has fostered broad and sustained backing, underscoring the value of the Statement as a unifying policy declaration advancing shared principles. CONCLUSION: The Consensus Statement, Bridging the Gap in the Diagnosis and Management of Lung Cancer, reinforces five unifying principles: improve and expand prevention; focus on early detection; ensure equitable and sustainable access to treatment; build partnerships and promote investment; and, combat stigma, recognizing it as a social determinant of public health.",background unless greater awar inspir action lung cancer becom next global public health emerg despit improv screen diagnosi treatment must done global incid continu increas concert action must address burden within countri inequ result uneven distribut resourc inequ result differ prevent screen diagnosi treatment method particip 9th intern lung cancer network confer athen june 2023 receiv advanc draft declar confidenti notic email upon complet onlin registr invit provid comment suggest seven day meet contribut review author incorpor final version circul day meet began although formal delphistyl process approach priorit inclus transpar broad endors outreach extend beyond onsit attende ensur divers perspect represent process complement methodolog consensu approach unit stakehold around share polici goal result 9th intern lung cancer network confer particip invit sign final declar 785 sinc 20 organ worldwid formal endors consensu statement support continu grow inclus design foster broad sustain back underscor valu statement unifi polici declar advanc share principl conclus consensu statement bridg gap diagnosi manag lung cancer reinforc five unifi principl improv expand prevent focu earli detect ensur equit sustain access treatment build partnership promot invest combat stigma recogn social determin public health
cancer,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Glandular tissue component (GTC) on screening breast ultrasound (US) is associated with breast cancer risk. However, the impact of GTC on survival outcomes in patients with invasive breast cancer remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the association between GTC on preoperative breast US and survival outcomes in women with invasive breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 2889 patients with invasive breast cancer who underwent preoperative breast US between January 2013 and December 2018. GTC was qualitatively assessed on US and categorized as low (minimal or mild) or high (moderate or marked). Associations of GTC with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression model. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on menopausal status and molecular subtype. RESULTS: Of the 2889 patients, 966 (33.4%) had high GTC and 1923 (66.6%) had low GTC. In the overall cohort, high GTC was associated with worse DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.42 [95% CI: 1.17, 1.71]; P < .001), but not associated with OS (HR, 1.02 [95% CI: 0.81, 1.30]; P = .847). In the postmenopausal group, high GTC was associated with worse OS and DFS (HR, 1.68 [95% CI: 1.15, 2.46], P = .007; DFS: HR, 1.43 [95% CI: 1.05, 1.95], P = .022). In triple-negative breast cancers, high GTC was associated with worse OS and DFS (OS: HR, 2.22 [95% CI: 1.28, 3.87], P = .005; DFS: HR, 1.61 [95% CI: 1.04, 2.51], P = .035). CONCLUSION: Glandular tissue component at preoperative breast US was independently associated with survival outcome in patients with invasive breast cancer. If further validated, this finding may help refine prognostic risk stratification in clinical practice.",rational object glandular tissu compon gtc screen breast ultrasound us associ breast cancer risk howev impact gtc surviv outcom patient invas breast cancer remain unclear studi aim evalu associ gtc preoper breast us surviv outcom women invas breast cancer materi method retrospect studi includ 2889 patient invas breast cancer underw preoper breast us januari 2013 decemb 2018 gtc qualit assess us categor low minim mild high moder mark associ gtc diseasefre surviv df overal surviv os evalu use cox proport hazard regress model subgroup analys conduct base menopaus statu molecular subtyp result 2889 patient 966 334 high gtc 1923 666 low gtc overal cohort high gtc associ wors df hazard ratio hr 142 95 ci 117 171 p 001 associ os hr 102 95 ci 081 130 p 847 postmenopaus group high gtc associ wors os df hr 168 95 ci 115 246 p 007 df hr 143 95 ci 105 195 p 022 tripleneg breast cancer high gtc associ wors os df os hr 222 95 ci 128 387 p 005 df hr 161 95 ci 104 251 p 035 conclus glandular tissu compon preoper breast us independ associ surviv outcom patient invas breast cancer valid find may help refin prognost risk stratif clinic practic
cancer,"Metabolic steatotic diseases affect 16.7% of the French population, i.e. approximately 8 million individuals. Approximately 60% of type 2 diabetes patients have hepatic steatosis, 30% of whom also have fibrosis. The progression of fibrosis, linked to systemic inflammation, is associated with a significant increase in cardiovascular and cancer mortality (particularly hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma). In 2023, an international reform of the nomenclature led to the replacement of the old terminology ""non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)"" and ""non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)"" in order to better reflect the metabolic causes. The following terms were defined: ""steatotic liver disease (SLD)"", which refers to all forms of steatosis, ""metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)"", which explicitly includes metabolic factors, and ""metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)"", which emphasizes histologically confirmed metabolic steatohepatitis. A new entity, ""metabolic alcohol-related liver disease (MetALD),"" refers to MASLD with moderate but regular alcohol consumption. The definition of ""alcohol-related liver disease (ALD)"" remains unchanged (alcohol consumption greater than 50-60g/day). ""Cryptogenic steatosis"" includes cases with no known cause.

cancer,"Recurrent high-grade salivary gland carcinomas (SGCs) have limited treatment options, and immunotherapy's role remains unclear. This study evaluated radiologic and pathologic responses to immunotherapy in resectable recurrent high-grade SGCs. We retrospectively analyzed 108 patients from a tertiary center: 41 received neoadjuvant immunotherapy, while 67 underwent upfront surgery. Radiologic response (RECIST 1.1) and pathologic response (immune-related criteria) were discordant-34.1 % showed partial radiologic responses, but only 9.8 % achieved partial pathologic responses, with no complete responses. PD-L1 amplification correlated with response (25 % vs. 8.1 % in non-responders, p = 0.042), whereas B2M loss (29.3 % post-treatment, p = 0.032) and TP53/PIK3CA co-mutations (37.8 % in non-responders) were linked to resistance. Survival did not differ between groups (3-year event-free survival: 19.5 % vs. 23.9 %, p = 0.447; overall survival: 26.8 % vs. 31.3 %, p = 0.593). These findings highlight immunotherapy's limited pathologic efficacy in recurrent high-grade SGCs, with response rates lower on pathologic than radiologic assessment. PD-L1 and B2M alterations underscore the need for biomarker-driven strategies. This study provides a foundation for improving outcomes in this aggressive disease.",recurr highgrad salivari gland carcinoma sgc limit treatment option immunotherapi role remain unclear studi evalu radiolog patholog respons immunotherapi resect recurr highgrad sgc retrospect analyz 108 patient tertiari center 41 receiv neoadjuv immunotherapi 67 underw upfront surgeri radiolog respons recist 11 patholog respons immunerel criteria discordant341 show partial radiolog respons 98 achiev partial patholog respons complet respons pdl1 amplif correl respons 25 vs 81 nonrespond p 0042 wherea b2m loss 293 posttreat p 0032 tp53pik3ca comut 378 nonrespond link resist surviv differ group 3year eventfre surviv 195 vs 239 p 0447 overal surviv 268 vs 313 p 0593 find highlight immunotherapi limit patholog efficaci recurr highgrad sgc respons rate lower patholog radiolog assess pdl1 b2m alter underscor need biomarkerdriven strategi studi provid foundat improv outcom aggress diseas
cancer,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and antibacterial Photodynamic therapy (aPDT) have become a viable non-invasive treatment against cancer and bacterial infections. By using light-activated photosensitizers (PS), PDT effectively destroys cancer cells and pathogenic bacteria. However, many PS agents, such as Aluminum Phthalocyanine chloride (AlPc), face limitations like poor solubility and low bioavailability. To overcome these challenges, AlPc-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (AlPc NPs) have been synthesized, where PS is encapsulated in Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) to enhance drug delivery and therapeutic efficacy. PLGA was selected for its well-established biomedical applications, including targeted drug delivery and antibacterial activity. This study focuses on synthesizing 200nm AlPc NPs by using the single emulsion solvent evaporation method and characterizing them via spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. This study demonstrates that AlPc NPs' encapsulation efficiency is 82% and drug loading efficiency is 10%. The drug release profile shows 52% release of AlPc NPs within 24hours. Cellular uptake of free AlPc and AlPc NPs was examined using confocal fluorescence imaging. The in vitro investigation used Hep-2C human laryngeal cancer cells to assess the dark and phototoxic effects of free AlPc and AlPc NPs for PDT. MTT results show that the cells treated with AlPc NPs had lower cell viability than cells treated with free AlPc at the same drug doses, which confirms improved efficacy of AlPc NPs. Moreover, AlPc NPs improved the antibacterial potential against the Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacterial strain and increased their bioavailability.",photodynam therapi pdt antibacteri photodynam therapi apdt becom viabl noninvas treatment cancer bacteri infect use lightactiv photosensit ps pdt effect destroy cancer cell pathogen bacteria howev mani ps agent aluminum phthalocyanin chlorid alpc face limit like poor solubl low bioavail overcom challeng alpcload plga nanoparticl alpc np synthes ps encapsul poli lacticcoglycol acid plga enhanc drug deliveri therapeut efficaci plga select wellestablish biomed applic includ target drug deliveri antibacteri activ studi focus synthes 200nm alpc np use singl emuls solvent evapor method character via spectroscop microscop techniqu studi demonstr alpc np encapsul effici 82 drug load effici 10 drug releas profil show 52 releas alpc np within 24hour cellular uptak free alpc alpc np examin use confoc fluoresc imag vitro investig use hep2c human laryng cancer cell assess dark phototox effect free alpc alpc np pdt mtt result show cell treat alpc np lower cell viabil cell treat free alpc drug dose confirm improv efficaci alpc np moreov alpc np improv antibacteri potenti escherichia coli e coli bacteri strain increas bioavail
cancer,"One of the important markers that distinguish tumor cells from normal cells is metabolic reprogramming. Among them, the reprogramming of fatty acid metabolism not only supports the fuel supply for energy but also meets the needs of rapid biosynthesis, providing selective growth advantages for tumor cells to resist harsh microenvironments. Due to the crucial role of fatty acid metabolic reprogramming in tumor metabolism, its various functions in cancer have attracted more and more attention. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms of fatty acid metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells and the series of responses (such as active ferroptosis signaling), analyze the potential impacts brought by fatty acid metabolic reprogramming in various human cancers and focus on the significance of targeting fatty acid metabolic pathways and dietary control in cancer treatment.",one import marker distinguish tumor cell normal cell metabol reprogram among reprogram fatti acid metabol support fuel suppli energi also meet need rapid biosynthesi provid select growth advantag tumor cell resist harsh microenviron due crucial role fatti acid metabol reprogram tumor metabol variou function cancer attract attent review summar mechan fatti acid metabol reprogram tumor cell seri respons activ ferroptosi signal analyz potenti impact brought fatti acid metabol reprogram variou human cancer focu signific target fatti acid metabol pathway dietari control cancer treatment
cancer,"BACKGROUND: To establish a prediction model to triage difficult esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in order to reduce complications. METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 742 patients who underwent ESD for early esophageal cancer and precancerous lesions. Difficult ESDs were defined as those meeting any of the following criteria: (1) long procedure time (>/= 90 min), (2) occurrence of intraoperative adverse events (muscularis propria injury, perforation, and massive hemorrhage), or (3) piecemeal resection. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the predictors of technical difficulty. Then we developed a score prediction model according to the Framingham system for the first time and presented a convenient table containing the risk probability for each patient. In addition, the score model was validated in the validation cohort. RESULTS: The risk factors for difficult ESDs were as follows: lesion total length 4-6 cm (1 point), 7-9 cm (2 points) or >/=10 cm (3 points); lesion >/= 2/3 circumference (2 points); preoperative invasion depth extending to submucosa (2 points). Areas under ROC curves for the score model in the derivation and validation sets were 0.768 (95% CI, 0.726-0.811) and 0.719 (95% CI, 0.646-0.793), respectively. In addition, the percentage of difficult ESDs in easy (score = 0), intermediate (score = 1-2), difficult (score = 3-4), and very difficult (score >/=5) categories were 14.8%, 36.1%, 62.6%, and 87.5% in the derivation cohort and 14.8%, 33.7%, 56.3%, and 68.8% in the internal validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully established a prediction model to assess the difficulty of esophageal ESD and it can provide a scientific basis for clinical management to reduce complications.",background establish predict model triag difficult esophag endoscop submucos dissect esd order reduc complic method retrospect studi enrol 742 patient underw esd earli esophag cancer precancer lesion difficult esd defin meet follow criteria 1 long procedur time 90 min 2 occurr intraop advers event musculari propria injuri perfor massiv hemorrhag 3 piecem resect logist regress analysi perform identifi predictor technic difficulti develop score predict model accord framingham system first time present conveni tabl contain risk probabl patient addit score model valid valid cohort result risk factor difficult esd follow lesion total length 46 cm 1 point 79 cm 2 point 10 cm 3 point lesion 23 circumfer 2 point preoper invas depth extend submucosa 2 point area roc curv score model deriv valid set 0768 95 ci 07260811 0719 95 ci 06460793 respect addit percentag difficult esd easi score 0 intermedi score 12 difficult score 34 difficult score 5 categori 148 361 626 875 deriv cohort 148 337 563 688 intern valid cohort conclus success establish predict model assess difficulti esophag esd provid scientif basi clinic manag reduc complic

Yet, this burden remains poorly understood, as no prior study has comprehensively examined their economic impact. Moreover, the profound psychological suffering experienced by patients are often overlooked in existing global evidence This study aims to estimate the comprehensive economic burden of breast, cervical, and oral cancers in Bangladesh from the household perspective. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, primary data were collected through structured interviews with 346 adult cancer patients. A cost-of-illness approach was employed. Direct medical and direct non-medical costs were estimated based on respondent-reported expenditures. Indirect costs, including productivity losses, were calculated using the human capital approach. Intangible costs, reflecting psychological distress, were quantified using the willingness-to-pay method. RESULTS: The average total cost per patient was US$12,117, with breast cancer accounting for the highest burden. Intangible costs comprised 47.7% of the total, underscoring the substantial psychological impact of cancer on patients. The combined national economic burden exceeded US$1.17 billion. Catastrophic health expenditure was nearly universal (99.1%), with average treatment costs exceeding the catastrophic threshold by 44-fold. Expenditures were significantly higher among wealthier households, patients with longer disease duration, and those seeking care from multiple facilities. CONCLUSION: Breast, cervical, and oral cancers impose a major financial and psychological burden on Bangladeshi households. The near-universal catastrophic health expenditure and high intangible costs highlight the urgent need for equitable financing and accessible, affordable care. POLICY SUMMARY: Policies should strengthen financial protection, decentralize diagnosis and treatment, introduce insurance with cancer-specific benefits, establish an effective referral system, integrate psychosocial support and strengthen early detection programs.",background breast cervic oral cancer lead caus morbid mortal bangladesh place heavi diseas econom burden household health system yet burden remain poorli understood prior studi comprehens examin econom impact moreov profound psycholog suffer experienc patient often overlook exist global evid studi aim estim comprehens econom burden breast cervic oral cancer bangladesh household perspect method use crosssect design primari data collect structur interview 346 adult cancer patient costofil approach employ direct medic direct nonmed cost estim base respondentreport expenditur indirect cost includ product loss calcul use human capit approach intang cost reflect psycholog distress quantifi use willingnesstopay method result averag total cost per patient us12117 breast cancer account highest burden intang cost compris 477 total underscor substanti psycholog impact cancer patient combin nation econom burden exceed us117 billion catastroph health expenditur nearli univers 991 averag treatment cost exceed catastroph threshold 44fold expenditur significantli higher among wealthier household patient longer diseas durat seek care multipl facil conclus breast cervic oral cancer impos major financi psycholog burden bangladeshi household nearunivers catastroph health expenditur high intang cost highlight urgent need equit financ access afford care polici summari polici strengthen financi protect decentr diagnosi treatment introduc insur cancerspecif benefit establish effect referr system integr psychosoci support strengthen earli detect program
cancer,"An increasing number of Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models are being developed to predict radiation-induced toxicities (RITs) in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). But their performance and reliability remain uncertain. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the predictive accuracy and methodological quality of these models. We comprehensively searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies reporting on ML/AI models for predicting RITs in HNC patients. Eligible studies were assessed for bias risk using the PROBAST tool, and key performance metrics, including the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), were extracted. A hierarchical multilevel meta-analysis was performed to estimate pooled AUC values, and subgroup analyses explored the influence of study characteristics on model performance. A total of 67 studies with a total of 568 models were included, showing moderate discriminatory power of ML/AI models, with a pooled AUC = 0.76; 95 % CI: 0.73-0.78. Nonetheless, substantial heterogeneity was observed across studies. Incorporating imaging biomarkers significantly improved model performance. Prospective and internal validation showed comparable performance; external validation shows true generalizability. The predominance of retrospective designs and variability in predictor selection may have introduced bias, affecting model reliability and generalisability. ML/AI models hold promise for predicting RITs in HNC patients, but methodological constraints limit their applicability. Standardised and transparent reporting of model development and validation processes is vital for improving comparability among studies. Future research should explore hybrid modelling methods and the integration of clinical, dosimetric, radiomic, and genomic data to boost predictive accuracy.",increas number artifici intellig ai machin learn ml model develop predict radiationinduc toxic rit patient head neck cancer hnc perform reliabl remain uncertain systemat review metaanalysi evalu predict accuraci methodolog qualiti model comprehens search pubm embas web scienc cochran librari identifi studi report mlai model predict rit hnc patient elig studi assess bia risk use probast tool key perform metric includ area receiv oper curv auroc extract hierarch multilevel metaanalysi perform estim pool auc valu subgroup analys explor influenc studi characterist model perform total 67 studi total 568 model includ show moder discriminatori power mlai model pool auc 076 95 ci 073078 nonetheless substanti heterogen observ across studi incorpor imag biomark significantli improv model perform prospect intern valid show compar perform extern valid show true generaliz predomin retrospect design variabl predictor select may introduc bia affect model reliabl generalis mlai model hold promis predict rit hnc patient methodolog constraint limit applic standardis transpar report model develop valid process vital improv compar among studi futur research explor hybrid model method integr clinic dosimetr radiom genom data boost predict accuraci

cancer,"Glioblastoma (GBM), a WHO grade IV astrocytoma, is the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer in adults and represents approximately half of all malignant brain tumors across different age groups. Modern treatment approaches, including surgical removal, combined radiochemotherapy, and follow-up chemotherapy, have yet to significantly improve patient prognosis. Patients typically survive only 15 months, with most experiencing quick tumor recurrence and less than 7% surviving beyond five years. Early GBM detection faces significant obstacles due to the vague initial symptoms and constraints of existing diagnostic tools, such as magnetic resonance imaging and invasive tissue sampling. These limitations often result in late-stage diagnosis, reducing treatment effectiveness. While liquid biopsy has emerged as a less invasive alternative allowing repeated sampling and ongoing monitoring, the low concentration of biomarkers in blood presents a significant challenge. Microfluidic technologies offer a revolutionary approach to GBM diagnosis. These biosensors enable precise microscale fluid handling and significantly increase the detection, concentration, and real-time analysis of circulating GBM biomarkers, including exosomes, nucleic acids, and proteins. This technology reduces sample volume requirements and allows quick, sequential disease monitoring, making early detection and personalized patient care more achievable. This review examines cutting-edge developments in microfluidic biosensor technology for brain tumor diagnosis, with a particular focus on GBM. By combining molecular analysis, miniaturized engineering, and liquid biopsy techniques, microfluidic biosensors have become crucial in neuro-oncology diagnostics. This review evaluates current capabilities, addresses technical challenges, and explores future possibilities for implementing microfluidic platforms in clinical settings to improve early intervention and treatment outcomes for patients with malignant brain tumors.",glioblastoma gbm grade iv astrocytoma common aggress primari brain cancer adult repres approxim half malign brain tumor across differ age group modern treatment approach includ surgic remov combin radiochemotherapi followup chemotherapi yet significantli improv patient prognosi patient typic surviv 15 month experienc quick tumor recurr less 7 surviv beyond five year earli gbm detect face signific obstacl due vagu initi symptom constraint exist diagnost tool magnet reson imag invas tissu sampl limit often result latestag diagnosi reduc treatment effect liquid biopsi emerg less invas altern allow repeat sampl ongo monitor low concentr biomark blood present signific challeng microfluid technolog offer revolutionari approach gbm diagnosi biosensor enabl precis microscal fluid handl significantli increas detect concentr realtim analysi circul gbm biomark includ exosom nucleic acid protein technolog reduc sampl volum requir allow quick sequenti diseas monitor make earli detect person patient care achiev review examin cuttingedg develop microfluid biosensor technolog brain tumor diagnosi particular focu gbm combin molecular analysi miniatur engin liquid biopsi techniqu microfluid biosensor becom crucial neurooncolog diagnost review evalu current capabl address technic challeng explor futur possibl implement microfluid platform clinic set improv earli intervent treatment outcom patient malign brain tumor
cancer,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk of vulvar dysplasia and malignancy in lichen sclerosus patients treated with topical clobetasol or topical calcineurin inhibitors. STUDY DESIGN: This population-level retrospective cohort study used TriNetX, a research database of electronic health records and claims data from United States and European patients. We assessed 55,696 adult lichen sclerosus patients and matched controls to evaluate baseline risk. To analyze treatment effects, 14,430 clobetasol-exposed lichen sclerosus patients were compared with matched corticosteroid-naive controls. 6,227 topical calcineurin inhibitor-exposed patients were similarly matched and compared to unexposed controls. Lastly, 7,239 clobetasol-exposed patients were directly compared to matched topical calcineurin inhibitor-exposed patients. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated to quantify the risk of developing the outcome, and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses with log-rank tests were used to estimate the cumulative probability of outcome occurrence over a defined time interval. Statistical significance was defined as a P-value <0.05 for all analyses. RESULTS: Over 10 years, lichen sclerosus was associated with an 11-fold increased risk of vulvar malignancy (RR, 11.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.92-13.76) and an 8-fold increased risk of vulvar dysplasia (RR, 8.04; 95% CI, 6.47-9.98) compared to controls. Clobetasol was associated with a relative overall reduced risk of vulvar malignancy, with a statistically significant risk reduction observed at the 2-year time point (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42-0.94). Topical calcineurin inhibitor exposure was not associated with an increased risk of vulvar dysplasia or malignancy at any time point. There were no significant differences in the risk of dysplasia or malignancy between patients treated with clobetasol versus topical calcineurin inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Lichen sclerosus is associated with a significantly increased risk of vulvar dysplasia and malignancy. In this study, clobetasol appeared to be protective against neoplastic transformation, particularly in early stages of the disease. Topical calcineurin inhibitors were not associated with an increased risk of dysplasia or malignancy.",object evalu risk vulvar dysplasia malign lichen sclerosu patient treat topic clobetasol topic calcineurin inhibitor studi design populationlevel retrospect cohort studi use trinetx research databas electron health record claim data unit state european patient assess 55696 adult lichen sclerosu patient match control evalu baselin risk analyz treatment effect 14430 clobetasolexpos lichen sclerosu patient compar match corticosteroidna control 6227 topic calcineurin inhibitorexpos patient similarli match compar unexpos control lastli 7239 clobetasolexpos patient directli compar match topic calcineurin inhibitorexpos patient risk ratio rr calcul quantifi risk develop outcom kaplanmei surviv analys logrank test use estim cumul probabl outcom occurr defin time interv statist signific defin pvalu 005 analys result 10 year lichen sclerosu associ 11fold increas risk vulvar malign rr 1108 95 confid interv ci 8921376 8fold increas risk vulvar dysplasia rr 804 95 ci 647998 compar control clobetasol associ rel overal reduc risk vulvar malign statist signific risk reduct observ 2year time point rr 062 95 ci 042094 topic calcineurin inhibitor exposur associ increas risk vulvar dysplasia malign time point signific differ risk dysplasia malign patient treat clobetasol versu topic calcineurin inhibitor conclus lichen sclerosu associ significantli increas risk vulvar dysplasia malign studi clobetasol appear protect neoplast transform particularli earli stage diseas topic calcineurin inhibitor associ increas risk dysplasia malign
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancers that invade the cervical stroma are generally associated with worse clinical outcomes than tumors confined to the uterine corpus. However, tumors that spread to the cervical stroma often present other adverse prognostic features, making it uncertain whether cervical stromal invasion independently influences prognosis. Previous studies have provided limited and inconsistent results. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the independent prognostic significance of cervical stromal invasion in patients with early-stage endometrial cancer. STUDY DESIGN: This multicenter retrospective study included patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics 2009 stage I-II endometrial cancer who underwent surgical staging at nine regional medical institutions across China between 2000 and 2019. The primary outcome was progression-free survival, and the secondary outcome was overall survival. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association of cervical stromal invasion with survival outcomes. Propensity score matching was applied to balance baseline characteristics between patients with and without cervical stromal invasion. Variables used for propensity score were age at diagnosis, hypertension, diabetes, carbohydrate antigen 125 level, histological type, depth of myometrial invasion, lymphovascular space invasion, peritoneal cytology, surgical approach, type of hysterectomy, lymphadenectomy, and adjuvant therapy. To assess the robustness of the findings, subgroup analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 7,383 patients were included (524 with cervical stromal invasion and 6,859 without cervical stromal invasion). Cervical stromal invasion was not independently associated with decreased progression-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.94-1.81; P=.106) and overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-2.00; P=.171) at multivariable analysis performed on the entire cohort. In the propensity score-matched cohort, patients with and without cervical stromal invasion showed similar 5-year progression-free survival and overall survival (92.3% vs 93.7%, P=.493; 95.0% vs 95.7%, P=.791). Subgroup analyses by histological type and adjuvant therapy also showed no significant differences in survival outcomes between patients with and without cervical stromal invasion. CONCLUSION: After adjusting for confounders, the presence of cervical stromal invasion does not affect progression-free survival or overall survival in women with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics 2009 stage I-II endometrial cancer.",background endometri cancer invad cervic stroma gener associ wors clinic outcom tumor confin uterin corpu howev tumor spread cervic stroma often present advers prognost featur make uncertain whether cervic stromal invas independ influenc prognosi previou studi provid limit inconsist result object object studi evalu independ prognost signific cervic stromal invas patient earlystag endometri cancer studi design multicent retrospect studi includ patient intern feder gynecolog obstetr 2009 stage iii endometri cancer underw surgic stage nine region medic institut across china 2000 2019 primari outcom progressionfre surviv secondari outcom overal surviv cox proport hazard regress model use estim hazard ratio 95 confid interv associ cervic stromal invas surviv outcom propens score match appli balanc baselin characterist patient without cervic stromal invas variabl use propens score age diagnosi hypertens diabet carbohydr antigen 125 level histolog type depth myometri invas lymphovascular space invas periton cytolog surgic approach type hysterectomi lymphadenectomi adjuv therapi assess robust find subgroup analys perform result total 7383 patient includ 524 cervic stromal invas 6859 without cervic stromal invas cervic stromal invas independ associ decreas progressionfre surviv adjust hazard ratio 131 95 confid interv 094181 p106 overal surviv adjust hazard ratio 133 95 confid interv 088200 p171 multivari analysi perform entir cohort propens scorematch cohort patient without cervic stromal invas show similar 5year progressionfre surviv overal surviv 923 vs 937 p493 950 vs 957 p791 subgroup analys histolog type adjuv therapi also show signific differ surviv outcom patient without cervic stromal invas conclus adjust confound presenc cervic stromal invas affect progressionfre surviv overal surviv women intern feder gynecolog obstetr 2009 stage iii endometri cancer
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a high risk of early recurrence after surgery. We evaluated the utility of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) taken at different time points as a prognostic tool. Secondary aims were prognostic value of ctDNA combined with plasma carbohydrate antigen (CA)-19-9 and of peritoneal tumour DNA (ptDNA). METHODS: A total of 75 patients were included. Plasma samples were obtained preoperatively, 1 month, and 7-9 months after resection. Peritoneal lavage fluid (PLF) was collected preoperatively and 7-9 months after resection. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from plasma and ptDNA was analysed using mutation specific digital droplet PCR assays in a tumour-informed apprach. Kaplan-Meier survival curves, univariable, and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: Preoperatively, detectable ctDNA was an independent risk factor for OS (HR=1.88, p=0.047). Detectable ctDNA 7-9 months after surgerywas an independent risk factor for RFS (HR=4.48, p=0.017). Detectable ctDNA 1 month after surgery showed decreased RFS (HR=1.98, p=0.055). Preoperative, 1-month, and 7-9 months postoperative positivity for ctDNA and/or CA 19-9 showed a significantly worse median OS (p=0.024, p=0.008, and p=0.0003). We did not find association of ptDNA with OS or RFS, but ptDNA detection 7-9 months after surgery was associated with peritoneal RFS (p=0.003). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that detectable ctDNA in plasma taken before and 7-9 months after surgery holds independent prognostic value in surgically treated PDAC. Combination of ctDNA with CA-19-9 may be a particularly strong prognosticator, which should be confirmed in future studies.",introduct pancreat ductal adenocarcinoma pdac high risk earli recurr surgeri evalu util circul tumour dna ctdna taken differ time point prognost tool secondari aim prognost valu ctdna combin plasma carbohydr antigen ca199 periton tumour dna ptdna method total 75 patient includ plasma sampl obtain preoper 1 month 79 month resect periton lavag fluid plf collect preoper 79 month resect cellfre dna cfdna plasma ptdna analys use mutat specif digit droplet pcr assay tumourinform apprach kaplanmei surviv curv univari multivari cox proport hazard model use assess overal surviv os recurrencefre surviv rf result preoper detect ctdna independ risk factor os hr188 p0047 detect ctdna 79 month surgerywa independ risk factor rf hr448 p0017 detect ctdna 1 month surgeri show decreas rf hr198 p0055 preoper 1month 79 month postop posit ctdna andor ca 199 show significantli wors median os p0024 p0008 p00003 find associ ptdna os rf ptdna detect 79 month surgeri associ periton rf p0003 conclus data indic detect ctdna plasma taken 79 month surgeri hold independ prognost valu surgic treat pdac combin ctdna ca199 may particularli strong prognost confirm futur studi

cancer,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are key therapeutic targets in oncology, and hydroxamic acid derivatives represent one of the most effective inhibitor classes. To explore the structure-activity relationships of this scaffold, a series of 2-mercaptoquinazoline-based hydroxamic acid derivatives (4a-e, 7a-i, and 10a-e) were synthesized and evaluated for HDAC inhibition and anticancer activity, with SAHA serving as a positive control. The 4a-e series emerged as the most potent HDAC inhibitors, with IC(50) values of 0.33-0.87 muM, led by 4a (0.33 +/- 0.02 muM), though weaker than SAHA (0.06 +/- 0.01 muM). Cytotoxicity assays across colorectal (SW620, HCT116), breast (MDA-MB-231), prostate (PC-3), and lung (A549) cancer cell lines demonstrated that 4b (6-CH(3)) and 4c (7-CH(3)) were the most effective, achieving IC(50) values of 0.93-1.34 muM in HCT116 and 1.79-2.08 muM in SW620. In the 7a-i series, compounds 7b (6-CH(3)), 7d (6-Cl), and particularly 7f (7-F) demonstrated notable cytotoxicity with IC(50) values of 1.14-3.64 muM across SW620, HCT116, and MDA-MB-231 cells, comparable to the most active derivatives in the 4-series; conversely, bulky halogen substituents (7g, 7i) or the unsubstituted analog 7a led to markedly reduced activity (> 4.5 muM). The 10a-e series was significantly less active, and 10e (7-F) showed undesirable toxicity toward normal MRC-5 fibroblasts (IC(50) = 0.72 +/- 0.02 muM). Mechanistic studies further confirmed that 4c and 7f induced G(2)/M arrest and apoptosis in SW620 cells. Collectively, these findings highlight 4a-c and 7f as promising lead compounds, combining submicromolar HDAC inhibition, potent antiproliferative effects, and acceptable selectivity, providing a strong foundation for further development of quinazoline-based HDAC inhibitors. Molecular docking studies supported these results by revealing favorable interactions of the hydroxamate zinc-binding group and the 2-mercaptoquinazoline scaffold within the HDAC active site, consistent with the observed structure-activity relationship (SAR) trends.",histon deacetylas hdac key therapeut target oncolog hydroxam acid deriv repres one effect inhibitor class explor structureact relationship scaffold seri 2mercaptoquinazolinebas hydroxam acid deriv 4ae 7ai 10ae synthes evalu hdac inhibit anticanc activ saha serv posit control 4ae seri emerg potent hdac inhibitor ic50 valu 033087 mum led 4a 033 002 mum though weaker saha 006 001 mum cytotox assay across colorect sw620 hct116 breast mdamb231 prostat pc3 lung a549 cancer cell line demonstr 4b 6ch3 4c 7ch3 effect achiev ic50 valu 093134 mum hct116 179208 mum sw620 7ai seri compound 7b 6ch3 7d 6cl particularli 7f 7f demonstr notabl cytotox ic50 valu 114364 mum across sw620 hct116 mdamb231 cell compar activ deriv 4seri convers bulki halogen substitu 7g 7i unsubstitut analog 7a led markedli reduc activ 45 mum 10ae seri significantli less activ 10e 7f show undesir toxic toward normal mrc5 fibroblast ic50 072 002 mum mechanist studi confirm 4c 7f induc g2m arrest apoptosi sw620 cell collect find highlight 4ac 7f promis lead compound combin submicromolar hdac inhibit potent antiprolif effect accept select provid strong foundat develop quinazolinebas hdac inhibitor molecular dock studi support result reveal favor interact hydroxam zincbind group 2mercaptoquinazolin scaffold within hdac activ site consist observ structureact relationship sar trend
cancer,"Histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) is a key member of the class IIa HDAC subfamily (HDAC4, 5, 7, and 9) that is characterized by a key tyrosine-to-histidine substitution in its active site, a feature that renders these HDACs catalytically inefficient and underscores their versatile roles beyond intrinsic deacetylation. Structurally, HDAC7 is distinguished from its paralogs by its lack of the conserved N-terminal glutamine-rich domain. This combination of functional duality and a unique structural context enables HDAC7 to regulate a vast array of cellular processes. Consequently, its dysregulation is implicated in numerous pathologies, including cancer and autoimmune disorders, establishing it as a compelling therapeutic target. However, effectively and selectively targeting HDAC7 is complicated by its context-dependent biological modes of actions and the high structural homology it shares with other class IIa isoforms. This review first provides a current overview of the multifaceted roles of HDAC7 in human diseases and discusses how its contributions are dictated by the complex interplay between its catalytic and diverse scaffolding functions. We then summarize the recent medicinal chemistry efforts, from the class-selective deacetylase inhibitors to the recently emerged targeted protein degraders that not only achieve superior isoform selectivity but also modulate HDAC7's deacetylase-independent functions. By bridging the functional complexity of HDAC7 with the latest advances in chemical biology tools, we aim to provide a timely summary of the current status of HDAC7 as a druggable target and offer a perspective on strategies guiding the development of next-generation modulators.",histon deacetylas 7 hdac7 key member class iia hdac subfamili hdac4 5 7 9 character key tyrosinetohistidin substitut activ site featur render hdac catalyt ineffici underscor versatil role beyond intrins deacetyl structur hdac7 distinguish paralog lack conserv ntermin glutaminerich domain combin function dualiti uniqu structur context enabl hdac7 regul vast array cellular process consequ dysregul implic numer patholog includ cancer autoimmun disord establish compel therapeut target howev effect select target hdac7 complic contextdepend biolog mode action high structur homolog share class iia isoform review first provid current overview multifacet role hdac7 human diseas discuss contribut dictat complex interplay catalyt divers scaffold function summar recent medicin chemistri effort classselect deacetylas inhibitor recent emerg target protein degrad achiev superior isoform select also modul hdac7 deacetylaseindepend function bridg function complex hdac7 latest advanc chemic biolog tool aim provid time summari current statu hdac7 druggabl target offer perspect strategi guid develop nextgener modul
cancer,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide, with a rising burden projected over the coming decades. While traditional risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia form the foundation of prevention strategies, many individuals carry a ""residual"" risk secondary to systemic inflammation which remains underrecognized. Landmark trials have established inflammation as a causal and modifiable driver of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). This review focuses on how inflammation can modulate interconnected diseases of the brain and heart. Growing evidence suggests inflammation mediates a ""brain-heart"" axis, linking psychological stress, neuroinflammation, and cardiovascular pathology. Observational and mechanistic studies demonstrate that stress-induced neural activity, particularly within the amygdala, is associated with hematopoietic activation, arterial inflammation, and increased cardiovascular events. Models such as Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy and stroke-heart syndrome illustrate how acute brain injury can precipitate cardiovascular dysfunction via autonomic and inflammatory pathways. More recently, molecular imaging studies have provided direct evidence of stress-associated amygdalar activity being associated with both cardiovascular outcomes and cancer prognosis. This emerging framework reframes the brain and heart as interdependent organs connected through inflammatory and neurobiological processes. It highlights the potential for novel therapeutic targets, including modulation of stress-related neural pathways, alongside established anti-inflammatory strategies. Future directions include refinement of targeted therapies, use of advanced molecular imaging, and mechanistic studies to better delineate the pathways linking stress, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease.",cardiovascular diseas cvd remain lead caus death worldwid rise burden project come decad tradit risk factor diabet hypertens dyslipidemia form foundat prevent strategi mani individu carri residu risk secondari system inflamm remain underrecogn landmark trial establish inflamm causal modifi driver atherosclerot cardiovascular diseas ascvd review focus inflamm modul interconnect diseas brain heart grow evid suggest inflamm mediat brainheart axi link psycholog stress neuroinflamm cardiovascular patholog observ mechanist studi demonstr stressinduc neural activ particularli within amygdala associ hematopoiet activ arteri inflamm increas cardiovascular event model takotsubo cardiomyopathi strokeheart syndrom illustr acut brain injuri precipit cardiovascular dysfunct via autonom inflammatori pathway recent molecular imag studi provid direct evid stressassoci amygdalar activ associ cardiovascular outcom cancer prognosi emerg framework refram brain heart interdepend organ connect inflammatori neurobiolog process highlight potenti novel therapeut target includ modul stressrel neural pathway alongsid establish antiinflammatori strategi futur direct includ refin target therapi use advanc molecular imag mechanist studi better delin pathway link stress inflamm cardiovascular diseas
cancer,"Photosensitizers (PSs) that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) under light irradiation are pivotal for biomedical applications owing to precise spatiotemporal control, negligible drug resistance, and minimal side effects. Yet conventional PSs often suffer from complex synthesis, low ROS quantum yields, and aggregation-induced ROS quenching. Coordination-driven self-assembly offers an efficient strategy to address these issues by combining metal acceptors with photosensitizing ligands to yield discrete, tunable supramolecular architectures. Heavy-atom effects from metal centers enhance intersystem crossing and ROS generation, while rigid, charged frameworks mitigate aggregation-caused ROS quenching and improve cellular or bacterial uptake. Incorporation of long-wavelength ligands further increases therapeutic penetration. These features enable broad applications in bioimaging, photodynamic therapy (PDT), chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and multimodal treatments. This review summarizes recent advances in the rational design of supramolecular PSs, covering fundamental principles, representative synthetic strategies, and state-of-the-art anticancer and antibacterial applications, including chemo-photodynamic combination therapy, photothermal-photodynamic dual therapy, and photoactivated immunotherapy. Remaining challenges and future opportunities are highlighted to guide the development of next-generation supramolecular PSs for clinical translation. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Supramolecular photosensitizers (PSs) assembled via coordination-driven strategies offer a promising platform for light-mediated biomedical therapies. By integrating metal centers and photosensitizing ligands, these systems enhance ROS generation, suppress aggregation-caused quenching, and enable tunable architectures with improved biological performance.

cancer,"Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a unique form of apoptosis that enables immunocompetent hosts to elicit specific immune responses against antigens associated with dying cells. Pyroptosis, a recently identified lytic programmed cell death pathway, can be utilized to achieve ICD. However, most pyroptosis inducers are inflammatory small molecules or chemical activators, which are often limited by drug resistance and systemic toxicity. Here, we present a photosensitive calcium-based nanoinducer (CaNMs@SP) that modulates intracellular calcium levels to enhance ICD effectiveness, providing a strategy to improve cancer immunotherapy by directly regulating calcium signaling. Under 750 nm light irradiation, CaNMs@SP can promote the influx of exogenous calcium ions into tumor cells through photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT), while the calcium ions carried by the nanomaterials diffuse within the tumor cells, resulting in an accumulation of calcium ions inside the tumor cells. This induces calcium ions overload, causing tumor cell swelling, membrane rupture, leading to ICD and the emission of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), thereby activating the anti-tumor immunity. In vitro studies confirm the upregulation of Caspase-3 and GSDME that induce tumour swelling and cell death induction. In vivo experiments show tumor ablation, T cell activation, and tumor recurrence inhibition, highlighting the potential of CaNMs@SP as a personalized immunotherapy through pyroptosis-dependent ICD. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We developed a photosensitive calcium-based nanoinducer (CaNMs@SP) that triggers calcium overload to induce pyroptosis-dependent immunogenic cell death (ICD). Unlike conventional small-molecule inducers, this platform avoids drug resistance and systemic toxicity by integrating photothermal/photodynamic therapy with calcium ion modulation. Demonstrating effective tumor ablation, T cell activation, and recurrence inhibition, CaNMs@SP offers a promising strategy for personalized cancer immunotherapy.",immunogen cell death icd uniqu form apoptosi enabl immunocompet host elicit specif immun respons antigen associ die cell pyroptosi recent identifi lytic program cell death pathway util achiev icd howev pyroptosi induc inflammatori small molecul chemic activ often limit drug resist system toxic present photosensit calciumbas nanoinduc canmssp modul intracellular calcium level enhanc icd effect provid strategi improv cancer immunotherapi directli regul calcium signal 750 nm light irradi canmssp promot influx exogen calcium ion tumor cell phototherm therapi ptt photodynam therapi pdt calcium ion carri nanomateri diffus within tumor cell result accumul calcium ion insid tumor cell induc calcium ion overload caus tumor cell swell membran ruptur lead icd emiss damageassoci molecular pattern damp therebi activ antitumor immun vitro studi confirm upregul caspase3 gsdme induc tumour swell cell death induct vivo experi show tumor ablat cell activ tumor recurr inhibit highlight potenti canmssp person immunotherapi pyroptosisdepend icd statement signific develop photosensit calciumbas nanoinduc canmssp trigger calcium overload induc pyroptosisdepend immunogen cell death icd unlik convent smallmolecul induc platform avoid drug resist system toxic integr photothermalphotodynam therapi calcium ion modul demonstr effect tumor ablat cell activ recurr inhibit canmssp offer promis strategi person cancer immunotherapi
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Although cancer is associated with elevated rates of suicidal ideation, not all individuals affected by this disease are equally vulnerable. This heterogeneity suggests other, including psychological factors may play a critical role in shaping risk. However, research has rarely examined suicidal ideation in cancer patients through the lens of established suicide theories. This study addresses this gap by investigating theory-derived psychological risk and protective factors, which are derived from the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (IPTS), the Integrated Motivational-Volitional Model of Suicidal Behavior (IMV) and cancer-specific suicide theories. METHODS: In total, 618 cancer patients from various settings completed questionnaires assessing sociodemographic and cancer-associated characteristics as well as perceived burdensomeness/thwarted belongingness (IPTS), defeat/entrapment (IMV), primary and secondary control. Multiple network analyses were conducted, exploring the structure and interplay of these factors and their relation to suicidal ideation - independently for each theory as well as a combined overall network. RESULTS: Suicidal ideation was reported by 11.74 % of participants. All core risk factors of the IPTS and IMV were (indirectly) associated with suicidal ideation, with perceived burdensomeness being the only variable with a direct link. Perceived burdensomeness also accounted for most of suicidal ideation's variance (44.63 %; 95 %CI: 17.87, 68.57). Primary and secondary control acted as protective factors. CONCLUSION: Perceived burdensomeness forms the bridge between the psychological burden of cancer and suicidal ideation and should therefore be assessed in routine screenings and targeted in psychosocial interventions. Secondary control strategies hold great potential to buffer against adverse emotional states and dysfunctional cognitive biases.",object although cancer associ elev rate suicid ideat individu affect diseas equal vulner heterogen suggest includ psycholog factor may play critic role shape risk howev research rare examin suicid ideat cancer patient len establish suicid theori studi address gap investig theoryderiv psycholog risk protect factor deriv interperson theori suicid ipt integr motivationalvolit model suicid behavior imv cancerspecif suicid theori method total 618 cancer patient variou set complet questionnair assess sociodemograph cancerassoci characterist well perceiv burdensomenessthwart belonging ipt defeatentrap imv primari secondari control multipl network analys conduct explor structur interplay factor relat suicid ideat independ theori well combin overal network result suicid ideat report 1174 particip core risk factor ipt imv indirectli associ suicid ideat perceiv burdensom variabl direct link perceiv burdensom also account suicid ideat varianc 4463 95 ci 1787 6857 primari secondari control act protect factor conclus perceiv burdensom form bridg psycholog burden cancer suicid ideat therefor assess routin screen target psychosoci intervent secondari control strategi hold great potenti buffer advers emot state dysfunct cognit bias
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the expression levels of Toll-like receptor 3, 4, and 9 in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and their associations with clinicopathological parameters. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients diagnosed with oral cavity SCC between 2010 and 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Immunohistochemical staining for TLR-3, TLR-4, and TLR-9 was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. Expression was assessed based on staining intensity, staining status and percentage of positive tumor cells (prevalence). Associations with tumor stage (T, N, TNM), depth of invasion (DOI), lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PNI), extranodal extension (ENE), histological grade, recurrence, and survival status were evaluated statistically. RESULTS: No statistically significant correlations were found between TLR-3, TLR-4, or TLR-9 expression and any of the examined clinicopathological features (p> 0.05). Although an increasing trend in DOI was observed with stronger TLR-3 and TLR-4 staining, the results were not statistically significant. DISCUSSION: This study did not establish a clear prognostic role for TLR-3, TLR-4, or TLR-9 in oral cavity SCC. However, the findings highlight the biological complexity of TLR-mediated pathways in cancer. Further large-scale, multi-institutional studies are necessary to better understand the clinical relevance of TLRs in oral carcinogenesis.",introduct studi aim evalu express level tolllik receptor 3 4 9 oral caviti squamou cell carcinoma scc associ clinicopatholog paramet materi method fiftythre patient diagnos oral caviti scc 2010 2015 retrospect analyz immunohistochem stain tlr3 tlr4 tlr9 perform formalinfix paraffinembed tumor tissu express assess base stain intens stain statu percentag posit tumor cell preval associ tumor stage n tnm depth invas doi lymphovascular invas lvi perineur invas pni extranod extens ene histolog grade recurr surviv statu evalu statist result statist signific correl found tlr3 tlr4 tlr9 express examin clinicopatholog featur p 005 although increas trend doi observ stronger tlr3 tlr4 stain result statist signific discuss studi establish clear prognost role tlr3 tlr4 tlr9 oral caviti scc howev find highlight biolog complex tlrmediat pathway cancer largescal multiinstitut studi necessari better understand clinic relev tlr oral carcinogenesi

This study aims to investigate the feasibility of the Tai Chi modification of the submental flap in the repair of tongue cancer-related defects. METHODS: This project was designed as a retrospective cohort study. Clinical data of patients who underwent contralateral Tai Chi modification of the submental flap repair after tongue cancer resection at our institution from April 2024 to April 2025 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 4 patients (3 males and 1 female). No significant postoperative flap necrosis was seen, with only 1 case of tip bruising. In terms of tension in the donor area, the patients self-reported no significant tension in the neck, and no incision cracking was seen after suture removal on the 7th postoperative day. The patient's tongue function recovered well after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The submental island Tai Chi modification of the submental flap reconstructs tongue cancer defects with good postoperative functional recovery. And with low neck tension, the neck suture can be removed earlier.",background tai chi flap began novel design radial forearm flap report subment island tai chi flap studi aim investig feasibl tai chi modif subment flap repair tongu cancerrel defect method project design retrospect cohort studi clinic data patient underw contralater tai chi modif subment flap repair tongu cancer resect institut april 2024 april 2025 retrospect analyz result cohort consist 4 patient 3 male 1 femal signific postop flap necrosi seen 1 case tip bruis term tension donor area patient selfreport signific tension neck incis crack seen sutur remov 7th postop day patient tongu function recov well surgeri conclus subment island tai chi modif subment flap reconstruct tongu cancer defect good postop function recoveri low neck tension neck sutur remov earlier
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of PHI in detecting clinically significant cancer among biopsy-naive men with a PSA between 10-20 ng/mL. METHODS: We studied biopsy-naive men who underwent PHI testing followed by prostate biopsy after a screening PSA of 10-20 ng/mL. We performed logistic regression analysis to determine associations between clinicopathologic characteristics and the outcome of interest, which was the presence of grade group (GG) >/=2 at biopsy. We examined the combined effect of PHI with MRI findings in cancer detection. RESULTS: There were 456 patients, of whom 304 (66.7%) had cancer at biopsy. The median PHI of patients with GG >/=2 was significantly higher than those without cancer (76.3 vs. 44.2, P<0.001). Patients with PHI >/=55.0 demonstrated an 8.9 times (P=0.001) increased odds of GG >/=2 disease than patients with PHI 0-26.9. Higher PI-RADS scores on MRI were associated with a significant increase in cancer detection. Cancer was diagnosed in zero patients with PHI <36 and PI-RADS 1-2 and in 1 of 22 patients (4.5%) with PHI <36 and PI-RADS 1-3. CONCLUSIONS: PHI was associated with the detection of cancer among biopsy-naive men with a screening PSA of 10-20 ng/mL. The combined use of PHI and MRI can help triage patients in lower resource settings and reduce unnecessary biopsies.",object examin role phi detect clinic signific cancer among biopsyna men psa 1020 ngml method studi biopsyna men underw phi test follow prostat biopsi screen psa 1020 ngml perform logist regress analysi determin associ clinicopatholog characterist outcom interest presenc grade group gg 2 biopsi examin combin effect phi mri find cancer detect result 456 patient 304 667 cancer biopsi median phi patient gg 2 significantli higher without cancer 763 vs 442 p0001 patient phi 550 demonstr 89 time p0001 increas odd gg 2 diseas patient phi 0269 higher pirad score mri associ signific increas cancer detect cancer diagnos zero patient phi 36 pirad 12 1 22 patient 45 phi 36 pirad 13 conclus phi associ detect cancer among biopsyna men screen psa 1020 ngml combin use phi mri help triag patient lower resourc set reduc unnecessari biopsi
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Perioperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a leading cause of preventable morbidity in the perioperative period. Despite evidence-based guidelines, significant practice variations exist globally. The aim of this study was to compare major international guidelines for VTE prophylaxis in gynecologic surgery. DATA SOURCES: Guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American College of Chest Physicians, American Society of Clinical Oncology, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom, National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, Society of Obstetrician and Gynecologists of Canada, Federation of Columbian Obstetrics and Gynecology, and the German G3 Society were reviewed. METHOD OF STUDY SELECTION: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus and Embase to search for a major international guideline related to VTE prophylaxis in gynecological surgery. TABULATION, INTEGRATION AND RESULTS: Most international guidelines support the use of a risk assessment model (RAM), such as the Caprini score. There is broad consensus on the use of pharmacologic and mechanical prophylaxis for moderate- to high-risk patients and for extended prophylaxis in cancer-related surgeries. However, guidelines inconsistently address other aspects of VTE prophylaxis such as, timing of pre- and postoperative prophylaxis, use in minimally invasive surgery, and management of same-day discharge cases. CONCLUSIONS: Establishing consistent international guidelines for VTE prophylaxis is essential to help providers worldwide prevent a potentially fatal complication following gynecologic surgery. Further research is needed to standardize best practices and support their incorporation into guidelines.",object periop venou thromboembol vte remain lead caus prevent morbid periop period despit evidencebas guidelin signific practic variat exist global aim studi compar major intern guidelin vte prophylaxi gynecolog surgeri data sourc guidelin american colleg obstetrician gynecologist american colleg chest physician american societi clinic oncolog nation institut health care excel unit kingdom nation health medic research council australia societi obstetrician gynecologist canada feder columbian obstetr gynecolog german g3 societi review method studi select comprehens literatur search conduct use pubm scopu embas search major intern guidelin relat vte prophylaxi gynecolog surgeri tabul integr result intern guidelin support use risk assess model ram caprini score broad consensu use pharmacolog mechan prophylaxi moder highrisk patient extend prophylaxi cancerrel surgeri howev guidelin inconsist address aspect vte prophylaxi time pre postop prophylaxi use minim invas surgeri manag sameday discharg case conclus establish consist intern guidelin vte prophylaxi essenti help provid worldwid prevent potenti fatal complic follow gynecolog surgeri research need standard best practic support incorpor guidelin
cancer,"GISTs are predominantly characterized by mutations in KIT or PDGFRA. Mutation detection is important for optimal therapy. NGS panels are useful in GIST assessment as they allow for simultaneous evaluation of multiple genes. However, inherent to use of NGS with short read sequences on formalin-fixed specimens is the potential to miss larger indel variants. Over nine years, GIST testing was performed on specimens from 55 patients by amplicon-based, semi-conductor NGS using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 (CHPv2), a CHPv2-based GIST panel, or the Oncomine Precision Assay. Negative cases were evaluated by dideoxy sequencing for detection of mutations in KIT and PDGFRA, as per our clinical protocol. Prior to reflexive sequencing, out of 55 completed analyses, 47 (85%) were positive for KIT or PDGFRA mutations by NGS. Three cases were attributed to positivity for pathogenic variants in other genes. Of the 5 cases evaluated by dideoxy sequencing, all five (9% of all specimens) were positive for pathogenic or likely pathogenic KIT mutations. 12% of KIT mutations required dideoxy sequencing for identification. Mutations were 12 to 39 nucleotide deletion or duplication variants. Our results suggest that short read, amplicon-based NGS assays may miss a significant number of clinically actionable KIT mutations and that follow-up of KIT and PDGFRA NGS-negative cases by alternative testing modalities should be considered.",gist predominantli character mutat kit pdgfra mutat detect import optim therapi ng panel use gist assess allow simultan evalu multipl gene howev inher use ng short read sequenc formalinfix specimen potenti miss larger indel variant nine year gist test perform specimen 55 patient ampliconbas semiconductor ng use ion ampliseq cancer hotspot panel v2 chpv2 chpv2base gist panel oncomin precis assay neg case evalu dideoxi sequenc detect mutat kit pdgfra per clinic protocol prior reflex sequenc 55 complet analys 47 85 posit kit pdgfra mutat ng three case attribut posit pathogen variant gene 5 case evalu dideoxi sequenc five 9 specimen posit pathogen like pathogen kit mutat 12 kit mutat requir dideoxi sequenc identif mutat 12 39 nucleotid delet duplic variant result suggest short read ampliconbas ng assay may miss signific number clinic action kit mutat followup kit pdgfra ngsneg case altern test modal consid
cancer,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) arising on a background of fibrosis has fundamental mechanistic and clinical differences compared to HCC that arises in a non-fibrotic liver. The fibrotic microenvironment is characterized by extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, dynamic interactions with immune and stromal cells, and activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Recent multi-omics analyses have demonstrated that these fibrotic niches dynamically promote hepatocarcinogenesis, metastasis and immune evasion. Several therapeutic strategies targeting fibrosis have improved HCC outcomes in clinical trials. These advances have facilitated an understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying fibrosis-driven HCC and are helping to optimize therapeutic prescriptions. This review synthesizes recent advances in understanding the role of fibrosis in hepatocarcinogenesis, aggressiveness, and metastasis; decodes how stromal-immune crosstalk defines immune escape through the fibrosis-driven '3C' immune evasion framework; and links mechanistic insights into fibrosis-driven HCC with emerging theranostic strategies. We emphasize that targeting fibrosis-driven oncogenic mechanisms may enhance the therapeutic efficacy in HCC, thus providing a scientific foundation for rationalizing this approach as a viable strategy against both liver fibrosis and HCC.",hepatocellular carcinoma hcc aris background fibrosi fundament mechanist clinic differ compar hcc aris nonfibrot liver fibrot microenviron character extracellular matrix ecm remodel dynam interact immun stromal cell activ hepat stellat cell hsc cancerassoci fibroblast caf recent multiom analys demonstr fibrot nich dynam promot hepatocarcinogenesi metastasi immun evas sever therapeut strategi target fibrosi improv hcc outcom clinic trial advanc facilit understand complex mechan underli fibrosisdriven hcc help optim therapeut prescript review synthes recent advanc understand role fibrosi hepatocarcinogenesi aggress metastasi decod stromalimmun crosstalk defin immun escap fibrosisdriven 3c immun evas framework link mechanist insight fibrosisdriven hcc emerg theranost strategi emphas target fibrosisdriven oncogen mechan may enhanc therapeut efficaci hcc thu provid scientif foundat ration approach viabl strategi liver fibrosi hcc
cancer,"Fatty acids (FAs) are indispensable for cellular homeostasis and centered in anabolic and catabolic pathways that are tightly governed by long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSLs). These enzymes drive fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO) to generate energy, remodel cell membrane phospholipid composition to dictate ferroptosis susceptibility, coordinate steroidogenesis and eicosanoid biosynthesis, and mediate metabolic reprogramming, thus acting as a central nexus between FAs metabolism and cell death. Dysregulation of ACSLs across malignancies fosters oncogenic dependency on metabolic reprogramming, influencing tumor progression, immune modulation, and therapy resistance, offering a rationale for anticancer therapeutic opportunities. Here, we delineate the decisive roles of ACSLs in the metabolic fate of FAs and cell death execution. We dissect their tumorigenic mechanisms through metabolic rewiring and cell death modulation, with an emphasis on ACSLs-mediated crosstalk between ferroptosis and cancer immunity. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of ACSLs-targeted agents in tumor therapy and the treatment of ferroptosis-associated pathologies, offering actionable insights for clinical translation.",fatti acid fa indispens cellular homeostasi center anabol catabol pathway tightli govern longchain acylcoa synthetas acsl enzym drive fatti acid betaoxid fao gener energi remodel cell membran phospholipid composit dictat ferroptosi suscept coordin steroidogenesi eicosanoid biosynthesi mediat metabol reprogram thu act central nexu fa metabol cell death dysregul acsl across malign foster oncogen depend metabol reprogram influenc tumor progress immun modul therapi resist offer rational anticanc therapeut opportun delin decis role acsl metabol fate fa cell death execut dissect tumorigen mechan metabol rewir cell death modul emphasi acslsmedi crosstalk ferroptosi cancer immun furthermor discuss potenti acslstarget agent tumor therapi treatment ferroptosisassoci patholog offer action insight clinic translat

However, patients treated by ICIs are in jeopardy for immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that attack any organ including the heart. ICIs-induced myocarditis (ICIIM) is an uncommon but possibly fatal irAE. With the increasing use of ICIs and improved diagnosis of this disease, the incidence of ICIIM is growing rapidly. In this review, we briefly overview roles of T cells and their immune checkpoints, and categorize the pathogenic process of ICIIM into three stages (upstream, midstream and downstream), with addressing recent research progress on the pathogenic mechanisms in each stage, particularly focusing on the downstream core pathogenic components and potential therapeutics for this disease.",advent immun checkpoint inhibitor ici renov oncoimmunotherapi around 50 cancer patient suitabl treatment howev patient treat ici jeopardi immunerel advers event ira attack organ includ heart icisinduc myocard iciim uncommon possibl fatal ira increas use ici improv diagnosi diseas incid iciim grow rapidli review briefli overview role cell immun checkpoint categor pathogen process iciim three stage upstream midstream downstream address recent research progress pathogen mechan stage particularli focus downstream core pathogen compon potenti therapeut diseas
cancer,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) being the predominant subtype. Despite the availability of traditional treatments such as radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery, as well as emerging immunotherapies, the five-year survival rate and prognosis remain suboptimal. Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) are the most abundant immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of lung cancer, and understanding their role in cancer therapy is highly important. This review comprehensively discusses the dual role of TANs in lung cancer progression. First, we examined the recruitment, classification, and single-cell heterogeneity of TANs, highlighting the distinct molecular expression and functions across subpopulations. Mechanistically, TANs influence tumor behavior through direct cellcell interactions and cytokine production. Additionally, neutrophils engage with other cells in the TME via metabolic reprogramming, programmed cell death, epigenetic modifications, and vesicle secretion. To date, no studies have systematically summarized and connected these mechanisms. Finally, we summarize the clinical applications and prospects of TANs in lung cancer, including their potential role in assisting in diagnosis, predicting prognosis, and targeting neutrophils to increase the efficacy of radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. We hope that this review provides insights for future research aimed at improving lung cancer prognosis through the targeting of TANs.",lung cancer lead caus cancerrel mortal worldwid nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc predomin subtyp despit avail tradit treatment radiat therapi chemotherapi surgeri well emerg immunotherapi fiveyear surviv rate prognosi remain suboptim tumorassoci neutrophil tan abund immun cell tumor microenviron tme lung cancer understand role cancer therapi highli import review comprehens discuss dual role tan lung cancer progress first examin recruit classif singlecel heterogen tan highlight distinct molecular express function across subpopul mechanist tan influenc tumor behavior direct cellcel interact cytokin product addit neutrophil engag cell tme via metabol reprogram program cell death epigenet modif vesicl secret date studi systemat summar connect mechan final summar clinic applic prospect tan lung cancer includ potenti role assist diagnosi predict prognosi target neutrophil increas efficaci radiat chemotherapi immunotherapi hope review provid insight futur research aim improv lung cancer prognosi target tan

cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with increased health risks, including cancer, but their impact on cancer screening behaviors remains inconsistently documented. This study examines associations between ACEs and guideline-recommended breast, prostate, cervical and colorectal cancer screening behaviors using data from 28 U.S. states. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of 134,174 respondents from the 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) was conducted, representing 80.1 million adults. Cancer screening adherence was assessed according to U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze associations between ACE exposure (0, 1, 2, 3, or >/=4 ACEs) and screening adherence, adjusting for sociodemographic and healthcare access factors. RESULTS: Women with two ACEs (aPR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.91-1.00) or >/=4 ACEs (aPR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.98) were significantly less likely to adhere to breast cancer screening guidelines. Men with one ACE (aPR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81-0.96), two ACEs (aPR 0.86, 95% CI: 0.77-0.94), and three ACEs (aPR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.78-0.98) had lower rates of prostate cancer screening adherence. No significant associations were found between ACEs and cervical or colorectal cancer screening. Insurance coverage and having a personal doctor were the strongest independent predictors of screening adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to ACEs is associated with reduced adherence to breast and prostate cancer screening, potentially compounding cancer risks in individuals with ACE exposure. These findings highlight the importance of addressing barriers to cancer screening among individuals with histories of childhood adversity.",introduct advers childhood experi ace associ increas health risk includ cancer impact cancer screen behavior remain inconsist document studi examin associ ace guidelinerecommend breast prostat cervic colorect cancer screen behavior use data 28 us state method crosssect analysi 134174 respond 2020 behavior risk factor surveil system brfss conduct repres 801 million adult cancer screen adher assess accord us prevent servic task forc recommend multivari logist regress use analyz associ ace exposur 0 1 2 3 4 ace screen adher adjust sociodemograph healthcar access factor result women two ace apr 095 95 ci 091100 4 ace apr 095 95 ci 092098 significantli less like adher breast cancer screen guidelin men one ace apr 088 95 ci 081096 two ace apr 086 95 ci 077094 three ace apr 087 95 ci 078098 lower rate prostat cancer screen adher signific associ found ace cervic colorect cancer screen insur coverag person doctor strongest independ predictor screen adher conclus exposur ace associ reduc adher breast prostat cancer screen potenti compound cancer risk individu ace exposur find highlight import address barrier cancer screen among individu histori childhood advers
cancer,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nutritional deterioration is highly prevalent in patients with advanced cancer, yet the diagnostic overlap and combined prognostic value of cachexia and malnutrition criteria remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the consistency between the Asian Working Group for Cachexia (AWGC) and Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria and their associations with overall survival (OS) in palliative care settings. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with advanced cancer referred to the palliative care team at Aichi Medical University Hospital between April 2019 and March 2024. Cachexia and malnutrition were diagnosed according to the AWGC and GLIM frameworks, incorporating both phenotypic and etiologic components. Patients were categorized into four groups based on diagnosis status: Group A (both cachexia and malnutrition), Group B (cachexia only), Group C (malnutrition only), and Group D (neither condition). OS was compared across groups using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for clinical covariates. RESULTS: Among 1,325 eligible patients, cachexia and malnutrition were diagnosed in 76% and 71%, respectively, with a 65% diagnostic overlap. Group A demonstrated the shortest median survival time (MST) at 74 days compared to 431 days in Group D (p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, only Group A diagnosis independently predicted poorer OS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.33, p < 0.001). Survival differences among Groups B, C, and D became evident only after excluding patients with edema (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Complementary application of the AWGC and GLIM criteria enhances prognostic stratification in patients with advanced cancer. Careful evaluation of fluid status is essential to optimize nutritional assessment and outcome prediction in this population.",background aim nutrit deterior highli preval patient advanc cancer yet diagnost overlap combin prognost valu cachexia malnutrit criteria remain unclear studi aim investig consist asian work group cachexia awgc global leadership initi malnutrit glim criteria associ overal surviv os palli care set method retrospect cohort studi includ adult patient advanc cancer refer palli care team aichi medic univers hospit april 2019 march 2024 cachexia malnutrit diagnos accord awgc glim framework incorpor phenotyp etiolog compon patient categor four group base diagnosi statu group cachexia malnutrit group b cachexia group c malnutrit group neither condit os compar across group use kaplanmei analysi cox proport hazard model adjust clinic covari result among 1325 elig patient cachexia malnutrit diagnos 76 71 respect 65 diagnost overlap group demonstr shortest median surviv time mst 74 day compar 431 day group p 00001 multivari analysi group diagnosi independ predict poorer os hazard ratio hr 133 p 0001 surviv differ among group b c becam evid exclud patient edema p 0008 conclus complementari applic awgc glim criteria enhanc prognost stratif patient advanc cancer care evalu fluid statu essenti optim nutrit assess outcom predict popul
cancer,"OBJECTIVES: Severe intraoperative hypotension is frequently reported during transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) using orally administered 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (5-ALA); however, the influence of anesthetic technique on prolonged hypotensive episodes remains unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 423 consecutive patients who underwent oral 5-ALA-guided TURBT between 2018 and 2024. Sustained hypotension was defined as mean arterial pressure <65 mmHg lasting >/=30 min. Baseline characteristics, anesthetic variables, and hemodynamic parameters were compared between patients with and without sustained hypotension. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors. RESULTS: Among patients receiving general anesthesia (n=274), the incidence of sustained hypotension varied significantly depending on the anesthetic agent (p=0.02). In multivariable logistic regression, remimazolam was independently associated with a significantly lower risk of sustained hypotension compared with sevoflurane (adjusted OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.14-0.83, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-fourth of patients undergoing oral 5-ALA-guided TURBT experienced sustained intraoperative hypotension, with spinal anesthesia showing a lower incidence than general anesthesia. Longer anesthesia and surgical durations increased the risk. The choice of anesthetic agents under general anesthesia also appeared to affect the risk of sustained hypotension.

cancer,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a pivotal role in cancer progression, and their polarization toward the M2 phenotype contributes to immune suppression and metastasis promotion. One promising immunotherapeutic approach involves reprogramming M2 macrophages into the pro-inflammatory and anti-tumor M1 phenotype within the tumor microenvironment. This study investigated the effect of exosomes derived from 4T1 breast cancer cells, loaded with microRNA let-7a, on macrophage polarization and tumor-related behaviors. Tumor-derived exosomes (TEXs) were isolated and characterized by DLS, Flowcytometry (CD63) and TEM, followed by let-7a loading via electroporation. Peritoneal macrophages from Balb/c mice were extracted, polarized into the immunosuppressive M2 phenotype, and subsequently treated with let-7a -enriched exosomes (TEX+ let-7a), leading to their repolarization into M1 macrophages. Anti-cancer assays, including viability, apoptosis, metastasis, angiogenesis, and migration, were then performed. Results demonstrated that these engineered exosomes effectively repolarized M2 macrophages into active, tumor-suppressing M1 macrophages. The induced M1 macrophages significantly reduced cancer cell survival, increased apoptosis through elevated BAX/Bcl-2 ratio, and suppressed the expression of metastasis-associated (MMP2, MMP9) and angiogenesis-related (VEGF) genes. Moreover, cancer cell migration was markedly inhibited. Collectively, these findings indicate that let-7a -enriched exosomes can reprogram macrophage plasticity to effectively suppress malignant behaviors in breast cancer. This novel approach highlights the high therapeutic potential of targeted exosome-based miRNA delivery for refining tumor microenvironment regulation and advancing breast cancer immunotherapy strategies.",tumorassoci macrophag tam play pivot role cancer progress polar toward m2 phenotyp contribut immun suppress metastasi promot one promis immunotherapeut approach involv reprogram m2 macrophag proinflammatori antitumor m1 phenotyp within tumor microenviron studi investig effect exosom deriv 4t1 breast cancer cell load microrna let7a macrophag polar tumorrel behavior tumorderiv exosom tex isol character dl flowcytometri cd63 tem follow let7a load via electropor periton macrophag balbc mice extract polar immunosuppress m2 phenotyp subsequ treat let7a enrich exosom tex let7a lead repolar m1 macrophag anticanc assay includ viabil apoptosi metastasi angiogenesi migrat perform result demonstr engin exosom effect repolar m2 macrophag activ tumorsuppress m1 macrophag induc m1 macrophag significantli reduc cancer cell surviv increas apoptosi elev baxbcl2 ratio suppress express metastasisassoci mmp2 mmp9 angiogenesisrel vegf gene moreov cancer cell migrat markedli inhibit collect find indic let7a enrich exosom reprogram macrophag plastic effect suppress malign behavior breast cancer novel approach highlight high therapeut potenti target exosomebas mirna deliveri refin tumor microenviron regul advanc breast cancer immunotherapi strategi
cancer,"Microplastics and nanoplastics (MNPs) are emerging pollutants widely dispersed in the environment, with humans primarily exposed through ingestion and inhalation. Although their biological effects are being increasingly studied, their potential effect on human health and disease risk remains uncertain. This Review summarises evidence on potential disease risks of human exposure to MNPs, while highlighting key limitations and research gaps. Evidence suggests that MNP exposure might elevate the risk of various diseases, including metabolic, respiratory, cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, hepatic, renal, and skin disorders, as well as infectious diseases, cancer, and ageing-related disorders. Despite extensive evidence of adverse effects in animal models and cell cultures, direct evidence linking MNP exposure to human disease risk remains scarce. A key challenge on research of MNPs lies in the scarcity of robust human exposure data and the narrow scope of existing studies on specific types of MNPs, leaving several environmentally prevalent plastic particles understudied. Addressing these gaps will require investigating the mechanisms of toxicity, relevant biomarkers, and disease pathways associated with MNP exposure. Such efforts will be essential to clarify human health risks and inform future regulatory and mitigation strategies.",microplast nanoplast mnp emerg pollut wide dispers environ human primarili expos ingest inhal although biolog effect increasingli studi potenti effect human health diseas risk remain uncertain review summaris evid potenti diseas risk human exposur mnp highlight key limit research gap evid suggest mnp exposur might elev risk variou diseas includ metabol respiratori cardiovascular neuroendocrin hepat renal skin disord well infecti diseas cancer ageingrel disord despit extens evid advers effect anim model cell cultur direct evid link mnp exposur human diseas risk remain scarc key challeng research mnp lie scarciti robust human exposur data narrow scope exist studi specif type mnp leav sever environment preval plastic particl understudi address gap requir investig mechan toxic relev biomark diseas pathway associ mnp exposur effort essenti clarifi human health risk inform futur regulatori mitig strategi
cancer,"Cancer immunotherapies benefit only a subset of patients, highlighting the need to define tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of immune evasion. Using a kinome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we identify MAP3K7 (transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 [TAK1]) as a checkpoint that protects cancer cells from CD8(+) T cell-mediated killing. TAK1 integrates tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon gamma (IFNgamma) signals to drive a cytoprotective response that blocks cytokine-induced death and prevents bystander killing by perforin-deficient T cells. Inhibition of TAK1 redirects TNF/IFNgamma signaling toward apoptosis via RIPK1 and caspase-8 while simultaneously amplifying IFNgamma outputs to further prime cells for cytokine-driven death. Mechanistically, TAK1 loss triggers proteasomal degradation of cFLIP, promoting complex II formation and undermining protective pathways. In immune-competent mice, TAK1 deficiency markedly impairs tumor growth, whereas immune-deficient hosts show little effect. Adoptive T cell therapy preferentially eliminates TAK1-deficient clones. These findings establish TAK1 as a tumor-intrinsic immune checkpoint and support TAK1 inhibition as a strategy to enhance cancer immunotherapy.",cancer immunotherapi benefit subset patient highlight need defin tumorintrins mechan immun evas use kinomewid crisprcas9 screen identifi map3k7 transform growth factor betaactiv kinas 1 tak1 checkpoint protect cancer cell cd8 cellmedi kill tak1 integr tumor necrosi factor tnf interferon gamma ifngamma signal drive cytoprotect respons block cytokineinduc death prevent bystand kill perforindefici cell inhibit tak1 redirect tnfifngamma signal toward apoptosi via ripk1 caspase8 simultan amplifi ifngamma output prime cell cytokinedriven death mechanist tak1 loss trigger proteasom degrad cflip promot complex ii format undermin protect pathway immunecompet mice tak1 defici markedli impair tumor growth wherea immunedefici host show littl effect adopt cell therapi preferenti elimin tak1defici clone find establish tak1 tumorintrins immun checkpoint support tak1 inhibit strategi enhanc cancer immunotherapi
cancer,"We previously showed that enrichment of the Bacteroides genus is associated with improved anti-PD-1-mediated tumor therapy. Here, we isolate 183 Bacteroides isolates from the feces of humanized anti-PD-1 responder mice. Supernatants from 6 of 183 isolates stimulate IFNgamma production from primary CD8(+) T cells. These six isolates (6-consort) enhance anti-PD-1-induced anti-tumor efficacy in syngeneic and orthotopic lung cancer models compared to non-responder feces-colonized mice, an effect dependent on the production of IFNgamma. Bioassay-guided fractionation and comparative metabolomics lead to the discovery of an active N-acyl amide (cis-Bac429) produced by Bacteroides. cis-Bac429 stimulates IFNgamma production by CD8(+) T cells but not synthetic saturated Bac429 (sat-Bac429), indicating structural specificity. Intratumorally administered cis-Bac429, but not sat-Bac429, significantly decreases subcutaneous lung and colon tumor growth in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy and drives IFNgamma+ CD8(+) T cell tumor infiltration.

cancer,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was among the first receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) shown to be activated by ligand-induced dimerization. Structural studies explain how ligand binding induces the dimerization of EGFR's extracellular region. Unlike other RTKs, EGFR's intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) is activated allosterically in an asymmetric dimer that is observed crystallographically, but not in cryo-EM studies of intact EGFR. Here, we show that this asymmetric TKD dimer forms only transiently - explaining its lack of definition by cryo-EM. By engineering an asymmetric TKD dimer and studying a TKD-duplicated lung cancer EGFR variant, we show that TKD dimerization increases kinase activity by several hundred-fold. We were also able to stabilize and visualize discrete asymmetric EGFR TKD dimers at high resolution using cryo-EM. Our findings argue that oncogenic mutations activate EGFR primarily by promoting TKD dimerization, and suggest that the transient nature of EGFR TKD dimers may allow biased EGFR signaling.",epiderm growth factor receptor egfr among first receptor tyrosin kinas rtk shown activ ligandinduc dimer structur studi explain ligand bind induc dimer egfr extracellular region unlik rtk egfr intracellular tyrosin kinas domain tkd activ alloster asymmetr dimer observ crystallograph cryoem studi intact egfr show asymmetr tkd dimer form transient explain lack definit cryoem engin asymmetr tkd dimer studi tkdduplic lung cancer egfr variant show tkd dimer increas kinas activ sever hundredfold also abl stabil visual discret asymmetr egfr tkd dimer high resolut use cryoem find argu oncogen mutat activ egfr primarili promot tkd dimer suggest transient natur egfr tkd dimer may allow bias egfr signal
cancer,"Tumor-resident CCR7(+) dendritic cells (DCs) are key determinants of antitumor T cell responses. Here, we examined the localization of CCR7(+) DCs within tumors and the impact of this positioning on antitumor immunity. Spatial, single-cell, and intravital analyses of human cancers and mouse models reveal that CCR7(+) DCs form perivascular clusters. Fibroblasts surrounding venous blood vessels produced CCL19, guiding CCR7(+) DCs into perivascular niches. Regulatory T (Treg) cells frequently contact perivascular CCR7(+) DCs, suppressing CD40 expression and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell activation. Treg cell depletion restored CD40 expression by CCR7(+) DCs, enhanced immunostimulatory programs, and improved T cell-dependent tumor control. Anti-PD-1 not only increased perivascular CCR7(+) DC clustering and IL-12 production but also strengthened Treg-DC interactions through a CCL22-dependent mechanism, limiting therapeutic efficacy. CCR7(+) DCs expressed both co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules, which may underlie their capacity for antitumor activation and concurrent vulnerability to suppression. Modulating the mechanisms that form and restrain CCR7(+) DC perivascular immune hubs may improve cancer immunotherapy.",tumorresid ccr7 dendrit cell dc key determin antitumor cell respons examin local ccr7 dc within tumor impact posit antitumor immun spatial singlecel intravit analys human cancer mous model reveal ccr7 dc form perivascular cluster fibroblast surround venou blood vessel produc ccl19 guid ccr7 dc perivascular nich regulatori treg cell frequent contact perivascular ccr7 dc suppress cd40 express cd4 cd8 cell activ treg cell deplet restor cd40 express ccr7 dc enhanc immunostimulatori program improv celldepend tumor control antipd1 increas perivascular ccr7 dc cluster il12 product also strengthen tregdc interact ccl22depend mechan limit therapeut efficaci ccr7 dc express costimulatori coinhibitori molecul may underli capac antitumor activ concurr vulner suppress modul mechan form restrain ccr7 dc perivascular immun hub may improv cancer immunotherapi
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Living in an urban environment exposes the population to a mix of environmental and social factors, known as the Urban Exposome, that can influence health via changes in DNA methylation. We hypothesised that linking urban exposures with epigenome-wide DNA methylation in blood can reveal impacts across the lifespan. METHODS: In the EXPANSE project, we conducted an inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies of seven European cohorts. Urban exposures were estimated at participants' home addresses and included air pollution (PM2.5, NO(2), O(3)), light at night, modified soil-adjusted vegetation index, and urbanicity. FINDINGS: DNA methylation was measured in blood samples from 1778 children (4-10 years), 878 adolescents (16 years), and 5975 adults (18-87 years). PM2.5, NO(2), and greenness were associated with methylation differences in children, while greenness and urbanicity showed associations in adults. Regional analyses showed differentially methylated regions (DMRs) across all life stages. Pathway analysis showed that monthly NO(2) in children was linked to immune and infectious disease pathways, whereas adult urbanicity was associated with immune pathways as well as PD-L1 expression and the PD-1 checkpoint pathway in cancer. INTERPRETATION: Urban environmental factors induce DNA methylation changes across life stages, with stronger associations in young children and adults. We observed a distinct contrast in the methylation changes associated with greenness compared to other urban environmental factors. However, disentangling exposure-specific methylome signatures remains a challenge.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by high genomic instability. Proteins involved in maintaining genomic stability, such as ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) and topoisomerase 1, are promising therapeutic targets in SCLC. Berzosertib, a highly potent, selective, intravenously administered ATR inhibitor, has demonstrated promising antitumor activity in patients with platinum-resistant SCLC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This phase II, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study (NCT04768296) included patients with relapsed platinum-resistant SCLC who received berzosertib (210 mg/m(2) on days 2, 5) and topotecan (1.25 mg/m(2) on days 1-5) intravenously in 21-day cycles until disease progression. Primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR per RECIST v1.1), assessed by an Independent Review Committee. Key secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS: A preplanned interim analysis for futility after the first 40 patients had completed their second on-treatment tumor assessment (or dropped out/died prematurely) revealed a low probability of reaching the predefined efficacy threshold, leading to premature study termination. At the final analysis (n = 73), four patients achieved confirmed partial response, resulting in an ORR of 5.5%. The median PFS was 2.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-2.7 months], and the median OS was 6.4 months (95% CI 4.2-7.6 months). No new safety concerns were observed, with the safety profile of berzosertib and topotecan combination therapy being consistent with the known risk profile of the respective monotherapies. CONCLUSIONS: No added clinical benefit of berzosertib and topotecan combination was observed over topotecan monotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant SCLC.",background smallcel lung cancer sclc character high genom instabl protein involv maintain genom stabil ataxia telangiectasia rad3rel atr topoisomeras 1 promis therapeut target sclc berzosertib highli potent select intraven administ atr inhibitor demonstr promis antitumor activ patient platinumresist sclc materi method phase ii multicent openlabel singlearm studi nct04768296 includ patient relaps platinumresist sclc receiv berzosertib 210 mgm2 day 2 5 topotecan 125 mgm2 day 15 intraven 21day cycl diseas progress primari endpoint object respons rate orr per recist v11 assess independ review committe key secondari endpoint includ progressionfre surviv pf overal surviv os safeti result preplan interim analysi futil first 40 patient complet second ontreat tumor assess drop outdi prematur reveal low probabl reach predefin efficaci threshold lead prematur studi termin final analysi n 73 four patient achiev confirm partial respons result orr 55 median pf 22 month 95 confid interv ci 1527 month median os 64 month 95 ci 4276 month new safeti concern observ safeti profil berzosertib topotecan combin therapi consist known risk profil respect monotherapi conclus ad clinic benefit berzosertib topotecan combin observ topotecan monotherapi patient platinumresist sclc
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy, a new therapeutic perspective for cancer, is frequently compromised by immunosuppression. Polysaccharides derived from Acanthopanax senticosus (ASPS) are natural polysaccharides extracted from the dried roots, rhizomes, or stems of Araliaceae family plant. Selenium (Se), a crucial trace element for immune system functioning, is often incorporated into polysaccharides to enhance their immunomodulatory effects. PURPOSE: This study sought to elucidate the immunomodulatory and antitumor mechanisms of a newly developed selenium-modified polysaccharide (ASPS-e1-Se). Unlike previously reported unmodified polysaccharides, ASPS-e1-Se was designed with the incorporation of characteristic Se bonds (O-Se-C, Se-O-C, O-Se-O, Se=O), which endowed it with unique structural features enabling interaction with intestinal flora, regulation of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthesis, and reinforcement of host immune responses against tumors. STUDY DESIGN: The structural characteristics of ASPS-e1 were analyzed using UV and FT-IR spectroscopy, its molecular weight analyzed by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), monosaccharide composition evaluated via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and selenium content quantified using fluorescence spectrophotometry. The structure of ASPS-e1-Se was further characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy. A mouse S180 sarcoma model was applied to assess the immunomodulatory and antitumor effects of ASPS-e1-Se, assessing tumor inhibition rates, thymus and spleen indices, histopathological changes, and serum cytokines IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-10. Splenic tissue underwent mRNA-seq analysis with RT-qPCR validation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), while intestinal content was analyzed through 16S rDNA sequencing and SCFA profiling. RESULTS: ASPS-e1, with a molecular weight of 1.920x10(4) (+/-2.080 %) g/mol, primarily comprises GalA, Ara, Gal, Xyl, Rha, Glc, GlcA, and Fuc in molar ratios of 3761:513:229:109:260:127:84:46. ASPS-e1-Se, containing 2.005 mg/g of Se, exhibited characteristic absorption peaks O-Se-C, Se-O-C, O-Se-O, and Se=O. ASPS-e1-Se effectively inhibited tumor growth and restored immune organ indices and their histopathological structures in the S180 mouse model. ASPS-e1-Se treatment increased pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) and decreased the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. It upregulated genes Tradd, Traf5, and IKKalpha while downregulating AK1, gadd45beta, SMAD2, SMAD3 and STAT3, influencing the NF-kappaB signaling pathway and initiating an immune response against tumor cells. Additionally, ASPS-e1-Se elevated the Firmicute/Bacteroidetes ratio, enhanced Lactobacillus proliferation, suppressed Alloprevotella growth, and boosted total SCFA production, particularly propionate and butyrate, while reducing acetate, thus stabilizing intestinal microbiota and improving antitumor immunity. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that ASPS-e1-Se, with its unique selenium-driven structural modification, exerts antitumor effects through coordinated regulation of cytokines, NF-kappaB-related gene expression, gut microbiota composition, and SCFA synthesis. This integrated mechanism highlights the novelty and innovative potential of ASPS-e1-Se compared with previously reported polysaccharides, underscoring its promise as a next-generation immunotherapeutic agent to overcome tumor-induced immunosuppression.",background immunotherapi new therapeut perspect cancer frequent compromis immunosuppress polysaccharid deriv acanthopanax senticosu asp natur polysaccharid extract dri root rhizom stem araliacea famili plant selenium se crucial trace element immun system function often incorpor polysaccharid enhanc immunomodulatori effect purpos studi sought elucid immunomodulatori antitumor mechan newli develop seleniummodifi polysaccharid aspse1s unlik previous report unmodifi polysaccharid aspse1s design incorpor characterist se bond osec seoc oseo seo endow uniqu structur featur enabl interact intestin flora regul shortchain fatti acid scfa synthesi reinforc host immun respons tumor studi design structur characterist aspse1 analyz use uv ftir spectroscopi molecular weight analyz highperform sizeexclus chromatographi hpsec monosaccharid composit evalu via highperform liquid chromatographi hplc selenium content quantifi use fluoresc spectrophotometri structur aspse1s character ftir spectroscopi mous s180 sarcoma model appli assess immunomodulatori antitumor effect aspse1s assess tumor inhibit rate thymu spleen indic histopatholog chang serum cytokin il6 tnfalpha il10 splenic tissu underw mrnaseq analysi rtqpcr valid differenti express gene deg intestin content analyz 16 rdna sequenc scfa profil result aspse1 molecular weight 1920x104 2080 gmol primarili compris gala ara gal xyl rha glc glca fuc molar ratio 37615132291092601278446 aspse1s contain 2005 mgg se exhibit characterist absorpt peak osec seoc oseo seo aspse1s effect inhibit tumor growth restor immun organ indic histopatholog structur s180 mous model aspse1s treatment increas proinflammatori cytokin il6 tnfalpha decreas antiinflammatori cytokin il10 upregul gene tradd traf5 ikkalpha downregul ak1 gadd45beta smad2 smad3 stat3 influenc nfkappab signal pathway initi immun respons tumor cell addit aspse1s elev firmicutebacteroidet ratio enhanc lactobacillu prolifer suppress alloprevotella growth boost total scfa product particularli propion butyr reduc acet thu stabil intestin microbiota improv antitumor immun conclus find demonstr aspse1s uniqu seleniumdriven structur modif exert antitumor effect coordin regul cytokin nfkappabrel gene express gut microbiota composit scfa synthesi integr mechan highlight novelti innov potenti aspse1s compar previous report polysaccharid underscor promis nextgener immunotherapeut agent overcom tumorinduc immunosuppress
cancer,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most treatment-resistant malignancies, primarily attributed to its dense and fibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM), which impedes both immune cell infiltration and drug delivery. Despite the remarkable success of immunotherapy in other cancer types, its efficacy in PDAC has been significantly compromised by the immune-exclusion barrier. Recent advancements in nanomedicine offer a compelling strategy to overcome this hurdle through the development of ECM-responsive delivery systems. These platforms are engineered to respond to ECM-specific triggers such as hyaluronidase or matrix metalloproteinases, enabling localized degradation of the tumor stroma while simultaneously releasing immunostimulatory agents. This review summarizes the unique ECM biology of PDAC, current limitations of immunotherapy, and recent breakthroughs in stimuli-responsive nanotechnology. This study also comprehensively discusses design principles, preclinical validation outcomes, translational challenges, and emerging strategies integrating ECM modulation with next-generation immune activation. ECM-responsive nanomedicine represents a transformative paradigm in stroma-immune co-engineering and offers a promising avenue for unlocking immunotherapy in PDAC.",pancreat ductal adenocarcinoma pdac remain one treatmentresist malign primarili attribut dens fibrot extracellular matrix ecm imped immun cell infiltr drug deliveri despit remark success immunotherapi cancer type efficaci pdac significantli compromis immuneexclus barrier recent advanc nanomedicin offer compel strategi overcom hurdl develop ecmrespons deliveri system platform engin respond ecmspecif trigger hyaluronidas matrix metalloproteinas enabl local degrad tumor stroma simultan releas immunostimulatori agent review summar uniqu ecm biolog pdac current limit immunotherapi recent breakthrough stimulirespons nanotechnolog studi also comprehens discuss design principl preclin valid outcom translat challeng emerg strategi integr ecm modul nextgener immun activ ecmrespons nanomedicin repres transform paradigm stromaimmun coengin offer promis avenu unlock immunotherapi pdac
cancer,"PURPOSE: To develop a retropharyngeal lymph node (RLN)-based scoring system using anatomical features and to evaluate its utility in optimizing N classification in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with nonmetastatic NPC treated at two tertiary referral cancer centers in China between January 2012 and December 2018. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the association between MRI-based RLN features and multiple survival endpoints. A simplified RLN risk scoring (RRS) system (incorporating RLN multiplicity, MID, adENE and CNN) was developed in SYSUCC cohort and validated in the GMUCH cohort. A new N classification system was proposed and compared with the 9th edition of AJCC N staging system using C-index. RESULTS: Positive RLNs were observed in 68.3 % of all patients, including 66.7 % (690/1035) in the SYSUCC cohort and 72.0 % (340/472) in the GMUCH cohort. High RRS (defined as RRS > 2) was independently associated with worse OS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.22; 95 % CI, 1.56-3.15, P < 0.001), PFS (HR, 2.45; 95 % CI, 1.87-3.20, P < 0.001), DMFS (HR, 2.71; 95 % CI, 1.88-3.91, P < 0.001), and RFS (HR, 2.20; 95 % CI, 1.51-3.20, P < 0.001). The proposed N classification system incorporated high RRS as a criterion for N3 disease, demonstrated higher C-index values compared with the 9th edition AJCC staging system for OS (0.666 vs 0.659), PFS (0.659 vs 0.639), DMFS (0.682 vs 0.663), and RFS (0.644 vs 0.629). CONCLUSIONS: High RRS was strongly correlated with inferior survival outcomes in NPC patients. Integrating high RRS into the current staging system by reclassifying these patients as N3 might improve prognostic stratification and offer more precise treatment guidance.",purpos develop retropharyng lymph node rlnbase score system use anatom featur evalu util optim n classif patient nasopharyng carcinoma npc materi method retrospect cohort studi includ patient nonmetastat npc treat two tertiari referr cancer center china januari 2012 decemb 2018 univari multivari analys use evalu associ mribas rln featur multipl surviv endpoint simplifi rln risk score rr system incorpor rln multipl mid aden cnn develop sysucc cohort valid gmuch cohort new n classif system propos compar 9th edit ajcc n stage system use cindex result posit rln observ 683 patient includ 667 6901035 sysucc cohort 720 340472 gmuch cohort high rr defin rr 2 independ associ wors os hazard ratio hr 222 95 ci 156315 p 0001 pf hr 245 95 ci 187320 p 0001 dmf hr 271 95 ci 188391 p 0001 rf hr 220 95 ci 151320 p 0001 propos n classif system incorpor high rr criterion n3 diseas demonstr higher cindex valu compar 9th edit ajcc stage system os 0666 vs 0659 pf 0659 vs 0639 dmf 0682 vs 0663 rf 0644 vs 0629 conclus high rr strongli correl inferior surviv outcom npc patient integr high rr current stage system reclassifi patient n3 might improv prognost stratif offer precis treatment guidanc
cancer,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a small but critical subset of tumor cells characterized by their inherent self-renewal ability, differentiation potential, and resistance to cancer therapies. Their capacity to reversibly transition between a stem-like and differentiated state, together with their ability to enter into quiescence, are key determinants of their contribution to tumor initiation, tumor progression, metastasis, and cancer recurrence. Among the various factors in the tumor microenvironment, increasing evidence suggests that interferons (IFNs) are key extrinsic modulators of CSC fate. Although type I (IFN-alpha/beta) and type II (IFN-gamma) IFNs have long been recognized for their antitumor properties, recent studies indicate that IFN-signaling may also facilitate CSC induction and maintenance. In this review, we summarize and critically assess our current understanding of the complex roles of IFNs in governing CSC survival, plasticity, and immunogenicity. We discuss how IFN-signaling thresholds, signaling duration, and intrinsic CSC regulatory networks determine whether IFNs suppress CSCs or instead reinforce stemness. By bridging mechanistic insights with therapeutic potential and clinical outcomes, we highlight emerging opportunities to exploit IFN pathways for improved biomarkers and therapeutic strategies to overcome CSC-driven resistance.",cancer stem cell csc repres small critic subset tumor cell character inher selfrenew abil differenti potenti resist cancer therapi capac revers transit stemlik differenti state togeth abil enter quiescenc key determin contribut tumor initi tumor progress metastasi cancer recurr among variou factor tumor microenviron increas evid suggest interferon ifn key extrins modul csc fate although type ifnalphabeta type ii ifngamma ifn long recogn antitumor properti recent studi indic ifnsign may also facilit csc induct mainten review summar critic assess current understand complex role ifn govern csc surviv plastic immunogen discuss ifnsign threshold signal durat intrins csc regulatori network determin whether ifn suppress csc instead reinforc stem bridg mechanist insight therapeut potenti clinic outcom highlight emerg opportun exploit ifn pathway improv biomark therapeut strategi overcom cscdriven resist
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Gynecological cancers present a dual burden of physiological and psychosocial distress. Self-care agency defined as an individual's capacity to initiate and maintain health-related behaviors is critical for optimizing well-being in cancer patients. While psychological factors, particularly personality traits, are known to influence self-care in chronic illnesses, their role in gynecological oncology remains underexplored. This study aimed to determine whether personality traits predict self-care agency among women with gynecological cancers. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional design was employed with 200 women recruited via convenience sampling. Data were collected using a demographic form, the Cervantes Personality Scale, and the Exercise of Self-Care Agency Scale. Simple linear regression analyses examined the predictive value of personality subscales on self-care agency. RESULTS: Personality traits were found to be significant predictors of self-care agency. Extroversion, emotional stability, and consistency explained 37.5 %, 20.1 %, and 30.4 % of the variance in self-care agency, respectively (p < 0.05). Women with higher levels of these traits demonstrated greater self-care capacity, while introversion, neuroticism, and inconsistency were linked to reduced self-care agency.

cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To identify potential biomarkers for laryngeal cancer and investigate their effects on the characteristics of laryngeal cancer cells. METHODS: Transcriptomic data from laryngeal cancer and normal tissues were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Differentially expressed genes were screened, and their correlation with overall survival was analyzed. Five candidate genes-HOXC9, MARVELD1, HOXC8, GDF6, and SYT1-were selected for further validation. Gene expression was assessed by qPCR in normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells (NP69) and laryngeal cancer cell lines (TU138, TU686, TU212). SYT1, consistently overexpressed in cancer cells, was further investigated. Protein expression was confirmed by Western blot. SYT1 was knocked down using siRNA and lentiviral vectors. Functional assays included CCK-8 for viability, colony formation for proliferation, wound healing for migration, Transwell for invasion, and flow cytometry for apoptosis. SYT1 expression in clinical samples was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: HOXC9, MARVELD1, HOXC8, GDF6, and SYT1 were significantly upregulated in laryngeal cancer tissues and associated with poor overall survival. SYT1 was consistently overexpressed at both mRNA and protein levels in laryngeal cancer cells. SYT1 knockdown significantly inhibited cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promoted apoptosis. SYT1 expression positively correlated with tumor stage in clinical samples. CONCLUSION: SYT1 is overexpressed in laryngeal cancer and promotes malignant phenotypes. Its correlation with tumor stage suggests its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.",object identifi potenti biomark laryng cancer investig effect characterist laryng cancer cell method transcriptom data laryng cancer normal tissu obtain cancer genom atla tcga differenti express gene screen correl overal surviv analyz five candid geneshoxc9 marveld1 hoxc8 gdf6 syt1wer select valid gene express assess qpcr normal nasopharyng epitheli cell np69 laryng cancer cell line tu138 tu686 tu212 syt1 consist overexpress cancer cell investig protein express confirm western blot syt1 knock use sirna lentivir vector function assay includ cck8 viabil coloni format prolifer wound heal migrat transwel invas flow cytometri apoptosi syt1 express clinic sampl evalu immunohistochemistri result hoxc9 marveld1 hoxc8 gdf6 syt1 significantli upregul laryng cancer tissu associ poor overal surviv syt1 consist overexpress mrna protein level laryng cancer cell syt1 knockdown significantli inhibit cell viabil prolifer migrat invas promot apoptosi syt1 express posit correl tumor stage clinic sampl conclus syt1 overexpress laryng cancer promot malign phenotyp correl tumor stage suggest potenti prognost biomark therapeut target
cancer,"The dry fruits of Amomum villosum (Av) are a traditional Chinese medicine used for gastrointestinal disease. Aromatic oil has been reported to have anti-tumor properties. However, its therapeutic potential and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Integrated approaches of response surface design, gas chromatography-mass spectrum-driven network pharmacology analysis, transcriptomics, machine learning, clinic correlation analysis, single-cell sequencing, molecular docking, and dynamics simulation to characterize bioactive compounds in Av and further uncover their potential mechanisms against gastric cancer. The extraction process of aromatic oil was optimized using Box-Behnken design, and the optimal yield of 2.85 % was achieved under the conditions of extraction time of 6.5 h, solution ratio of 16 mL/g, and mesh size of 30. Subsequently, 28 compounds were identified from aromatic oils using the NIST 14 database. Survival curves indicated that the intersection of compound targets and cancer targets was highly correlated with gastric cancer (GC). Machine learning algorithms screened out HMOX1 as the key target from the public dataset and validated the clinic relevance. Single-cell sequencing indicated that HMOX1 might be a crucial immune regulator for myeloid cells. In vitro cell experiments showed that both aromatic oil and its primary compound, bornyl acetate, significantly suppressed HGC27 and AGS cell proliferation and migration, while downregulating HMOX1; bornyl acetate exhibited superior efficacy. Finally, molecular docking and dynamics showed that bornyl acetate had good binding affinity with HMOX1. Aromatic oil and bornyl acetate exert anti-gastric cancer effects via HMOX1, which provides a molecular basis for developing Av-derived therapy in GC therapy.",dri fruit amomum villosum av tradit chines medicin use gastrointestin diseas aromat oil report antitumor properti howev therapeut potenti molecular mechan remain unclear integr approach respons surfac design ga chromatographymass spectrumdriven network pharmacolog analysi transcriptom machin learn clinic correl analysi singlecel sequenc molecular dock dynam simul character bioactiv compound av uncov potenti mechan gastric cancer extract process aromat oil optim use boxbehnken design optim yield 285 achiev condit extract time 65 h solut ratio 16 mlg mesh size 30 subsequ 28 compound identifi aromat oil use nist 14 databas surviv curv indic intersect compound target cancer target highli correl gastric cancer gc machin learn algorithm screen hmox1 key target public dataset valid clinic relev singlecel sequenc indic hmox1 might crucial immun regul myeloid cell vitro cell experi show aromat oil primari compound bornyl acet significantli suppress hgc27 ag cell prolifer migrat downregul hmox1 bornyl acet exhibit superior efficaci final molecular dock dynam show bornyl acet good bind affin hmox1 aromat oil bornyl acet exert antigastr cancer effect via hmox1 provid molecular basi develop avderiv therapi gc therapi
cancer,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a xenosensor that mediates the toxic effects of exposure to environmental contaminants, such as polycyclic and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons. Besides its role in metabolism, the AHR is involved in several physiological and pathological processes, such as cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. In particular, the activation of the AHR is associated with greater susceptibility to cervical cancer development, and several AHR-driven gene signatures correlate with cervical cancer survival. However, many aspects of the processes and factors that determine AHR activation and cell localization during tumorigenesis remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to identify the mechanisms involved in the regulation of the cell density-dependent localization of the AHR in HeLa cells. The results show that the low cell density-dependent nuclear localization of the AHR is driven by the availability of tryptophan, an essential source of AHR ligands such as kynurenine. They also indicate that c-MYC expression is promoted at low cell density, mediating the induction of SLC1A5 and SLC3A2, genes encoding for solute carriers involved in tryptophan transport and cell uptake. Moreover, our data also establish that under low cell density conditions SLC1A5, SLC3A2, and AHR expression are under beta-catenin and c-MYC control. As beta-catenin promotes c-MYC gene induction, the current data allow us to propose that once cell-cell interaction is lost, the release of beta-catenin from its interaction with cadherin triggers AHR activation and nuclear internalization.",aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr xenosensor mediat toxic effect exposur environment contamin polycycl halogen aromat hydrocarbon besid role metabol ahr involv sever physiolog patholog process cell prolifer tumorigenesi particular activ ahr associ greater suscept cervic cancer develop sever ahrdriven gene signatur correl cervic cancer surviv howev mani aspect process factor determin ahr activ cell local tumorigenesi remain unclear aim present studi identifi mechan involv regul cell densitydepend local ahr hela cell result show low cell densitydepend nuclear local ahr driven avail tryptophan essenti sourc ahr ligand kynurenin also indic cmyc express promot low cell densiti mediat induct slc1a5 slc3a2 gene encod solut carrier involv tryptophan transport cell uptak moreov data also establish low cell densiti condit slc1a5 slc3a2 ahr express betacatenin cmyc control betacatenin promot cmyc gene induct current data allow us propos cellcel interact lost releas betacatenin interact cadherin trigger ahr activ nuclear intern
cancer,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a highly aggressive malignancy characterized by a poor prognosis, highlighting the critical need to elucidate its underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrate the pivotal oncogenic role of PRSS23 in PDAC pathogenesis. Clinical analyses reveal that PRSS23 is frequently overexpressed in PDAC tumor tissues, and elevated expression levels are significantly associated with reduced patient survival. Functional experiments show that PRSS23 knockdown markedly suppresses PDAC cell proliferation in vitro and inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Transcriptomic profiling identifies the Hippo signaling pathway as a key downstream effector of PRSS23. Specifically, depletion of PRSS23 leads to inactivation of YAP, the central transcriptional co-activator of the Hippo pathway. Molecular docking simulations suggest that PRSS23 facilitates the formation of a ternary complex involving the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A and the Hippo kinase MST1. Subsequent experimental validation confirms that PRSS23 silencing disrupts the interaction between PP2A and MST1, resulting in increased MST1 phosphorylation. This enhancement of MST1 activity promotes the phosphorylation and cytoplasmic sequestration of YAP, thereby suppressing its oncogenic transcriptional functions. Collectively, our findings establish PRSS23 as a novel prognostic biomarker and a crucial regulatory node in PDAC progression. PRSS23 drives tumorigenesis and metastasis by stabilizing the PP2A-MST1 interaction, which impairs Hippo pathway signaling and leads to aberrant YAP activation. Targeting the PRSS23/PP2A/MST1 axis may therefore represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PDAC.",pancreat ductal adenocarcinoma pdac remain highli aggress malign character poor prognosi highlight critic need elucid underli molecular mechan studi demonstr pivot oncogen role prss23 pdac pathogenesi clinic analys reveal prss23 frequent overexpress pdac tumor tissu elev express level significantli associ reduc patient surviv function experi show prss23 knockdown markedli suppress pdac cell prolifer vitro inhibit tumor growth metastasi vivo transcriptom profil identifi hippo signal pathway key downstream effector prss23 specif deplet prss23 lead inactiv yap central transcript coactiv hippo pathway molecular dock simul suggest prss23 facilit format ternari complex involv serinethreonin phosphatas pp2a hippo kinas mst1 subsequ experiment valid confirm prss23 silenc disrupt interact pp2a mst1 result increas mst1 phosphoryl enhanc mst1 activ promot phosphoryl cytoplasm sequestr yap therebi suppress oncogen transcript function collect find establish prss23 novel prognost biomark crucial regulatori node pdac progress prss23 drive tumorigenesi metastasi stabil pp2amst1 interact impair hippo pathway signal lead aberr yap activ target prss23pp2amst1 axi may therefor repres promis therapeut strategi treatment pdac
cancer,"PURPOSE: This study aims to explore nursing students' experiences during oncology internships related to sexuality care for cancer patients, based on Mezirow's Transformative Learning Theory, and to reveal their shift from implicit learning to transformation. METHOD: A qualitative phenomenological design guided by Transformative Learning Theory was employed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seventeen final-year nursing students who had completed oncology internships. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi's seven-step method with MAXQDA software. RESULTS: Three main themes were identified: (1) Implicit Learning Experience (e.g., disorienting dilemmas, shared assumptions), (2) Meaning-Making (e.g., emotional reflection, rational discourse, emotional and cognitive dissonance, unclear professional boundaries), and (3) Transformation (e.g., actions, awareness). CONCLUSIONS: Students' progression from implicit learning to transformation in sexuality care demonstrates the potential of transformative learning to address cultural and educational barriers. Structured, reflective, and experiential interventions are essential to enhance competence and confidence in this area.",purpos studi aim explor nurs student experi oncolog internship relat sexual care cancer patient base mezirow transform learn theori reveal shift implicit learn transform method qualit phenomenolog design guid transform learn theori employ semistructur interview conduct seventeen finalyear nurs student complet oncolog internship data analyz use colaizzi sevenstep method maxqda softwar result three main theme identifi 1 implicit learn experi eg disori dilemma share assumpt 2 meaningmak eg emot reflect ration discours emot cognit disson unclear profession boundari 3 transform eg action awar conclus student progress implicit learn transform sexual care demonstr potenti transform learn address cultur educ barrier structur reflect experienti intervent essenti enhanc compet confid area
cancer,"PURPOSE: Women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer are recommended daily oral adjuvant endocrine therapy for at least 5 years, but up to 50 % discontinue early. We assessed an evidence-based, theoretically-informed, patient-centred intervention (HT&Me) to support adjuvant endocrine therapy adherence and improve quality-of-life, in terms of patient acceptability and feasibility to deliver within the UK National Health Service. METHODS: This single arm study aimed to recruit 45 women with stage I-III breast cancer within 14 weeks of first adjuvant endocrine therapy prescription. After completing baseline questionnaires, participants received the HT&Me intervention comprising: (i) a short animation; (ii) two personalised nurse/practitioner consultations (in-person or online); (iii) an interactive web-app; and (iv) regular email reminders. Participants completed follow-up questionnaires at 8 weeks. A sub-sample of participants (n = 20) and health professionals (n = 14) participated in semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: We recruited 51 participants. Participants varied in digital confidence at recruitment (low/moderate, 28 % (n = 14); high, 61 % (n = 31)). HT&Me was demonstrated as feasible to deliver. Overall, 69 % (n = 35) engaged with the web-app; 87 % (n = 40/46) found HT&Me helpful; and 80 % (n = 36/45) reported it motivated them to keep taking endocrine therapy. Both consultation formats were considered acceptable. Completion of outcome measures was high. Health professionals considered HT&Me addresses an important unmet need. CONCLUSIONS: HT&Me is feasible, acceptable and helpful to women. Findings provided valuable insights for design and delivery of the full-scale randomised controlled trial assessing effectiveness now underway (ISRCTN24852890). HT&Me offers potential to improve adjuvant endocrine therapy adherence, thereby reducing recurrence risk for women with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Accurate preoperative assessment of endometrial cancer is crucial for tailoring surgical and therapeutic management. Identifying correlations between ultrasonographic features and tumor histopathological and molecular profiles may help improve the accuracy of presurgical staging. OBJECTIVES: This multicenter retrospective study aimed to evaluate the association between ultrasonographic features, histopathological characteristics and molecular profiles in endometrial cancer to improve preoperative assessment and risk stratification. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 156 women from three Italian centers underwent standardized transvaginal or transrectal ultrasound following IETA criteria prior to hysterectomy. Ultrasonographic parameters, including endometrial thickness, echogenicity, junctional zone integrity, and vascularity assessed by Doppler, were analyzed. Postoperative histopathology and molecular classification (p53, MMR, POLE, NSMP) were performed. Statistical analyses evaluated correlations among ultrasound features, pathology, and molecular data. RESULTS: Endometrioid histotype was detected in 88.46 % of cases, mostly low-grade and early-stage. Cases in the early stage (i.e. lesions confined to the uterine corpus) accounted for 77.27 % of all cases. Ultrasound staging was consistent with the final staging in 65.5 % of cases, with errors primarily involving the overestimation of p53-abnormal tumors and the underestimation of MMRd tumors. Increased endometrial thickness was associated with a higher stage and grade (median 20 mm for stage III, p = 0.007). An irregular junctional zone was associated with high-grade tumors (p = 0.016). Complex and multifocal vascular patterns were significantly linked to advanced stages, high grade, and molecular aggressiveness, such as p53 mutations and MMR deficiency. Tumors with scattered vessels showed a higher risk of extensive lymphovascular space invasion. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound features, particularly vascularity, junctional zone irregularity, and endometrial thickness, are significantly associated with tumor stage, grade, and molecular profiles. Incorporating detailed ultrasonographic assessment into preoperative evaluation can help identify high-risk endometrial cancers and guide personalized management strategies. Larger prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.",background accur preoper assess endometri cancer crucial tailor surgic therapeut manag identifi correl ultrasonograph featur tumor histopatholog molecular profil may help improv accuraci presurg stage object multicent retrospect studi aim evalu associ ultrasonograph featur histopatholog characterist molecular profil endometri cancer improv preoper assess risk stratif studi design total 156 women three italian center underw standard transvagin transrect ultrasound follow ieta criteria prior hysterectomi ultrasonograph paramet includ endometri thick echogen junction zone integr vascular assess doppler analyz postop histopatholog molecular classif p53 mmr pole nsmp perform statist analys evalu correl among ultrasound featur patholog molecular data result endometrioid histotyp detect 8846 case mostli lowgrad earlystag case earli stage ie lesion confin uterin corpu account 7727 case ultrasound stage consist final stage 655 case error primarili involv overestim p53abnorm tumor underestim mmrd tumor increas endometri thick associ higher stage grade median 20 mm stage iii p 0007 irregular junction zone associ highgrad tumor p 0016 complex multifoc vascular pattern significantli link advanc stage high grade molecular aggress p53 mutat mmr defici tumor scatter vessel show higher risk extens lymphovascular space invas conclus ultrasound featur particularli vascular junction zone irregular endometri thick significantli associ tumor stage grade molecular profil incorpor detail ultrasonograph assess preoper evalu help identifi highrisk endometri cancer guid person manag strategi larger prospect studi need valid find
cancer,"The development of novel, safe, and effective anti-tumor agents represents an essential strategy within cancer chemotherapy. In the present study, a total of 60 flavone and chalcone derivatives containing benzimidazole groups were synthesized. The anti-proliferation tests revealed that most of the benzimidazole-chalcone derivatives exhibited excellent inhibitory activity against various tumor cell lines, while the benzimidazole-flavone derivatives showed relatively weak effects. Among the benzimidazole-chalcone derivatives, compound 19o with potential as a candidate anti-tumor drug was selected, and its anti-tumor biological activities in vitro and in vivo were evaluated. In the gastric cancer cell lines with superior anti-proliferation activity, compound 19o showed IC(50) values of less than 20 muM in MGC-803, SGC-7901 and HGC-27 cells, and it exhibited certain selectivity when compared with normal GES-1 cells. Compound 19o was verified to have inhibitory effects on colony formation and promote apoptosis in HGC-27 and SGC-7901 cells, and can block the cycle of HGC-27 cells in the G0/G1 phase. Further evaluation revealed that compound 19o inhibits the glycolytic pathway by suppressing the expression of HIF-1alpha and the key rate-limiting enzymes HK2 and PKM2 in glycolysis, and reduces the intracellular lactate content. In the HGC-27 xenograft nude mice, compound 19o was able to significantly inhibit the growth of tumors, and the inhibition rates at doses of 15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg were 30.95 % and 62.89 %, respectively. Furthermore, the compound 19o demonstrated certain safety in vivo, and exhibited acceptable pharmacokinetic properties after intravenous administration. Overall, the benzimidazole chalcone derivative 19o synthesized and screened in this study is a potential candidate drug for anti-tumor treatment.",develop novel safe effect antitumor agent repres essenti strategi within cancer chemotherapi present studi total 60 flavon chalcon deriv contain benzimidazol group synthes antiprolifer test reveal benzimidazolechalcon deriv exhibit excel inhibitori activ variou tumor cell line benzimidazoleflavon deriv show rel weak effect among benzimidazolechalcon deriv compound 19o potenti candid antitumor drug select antitumor biolog activ vitro vivo evalu gastric cancer cell line superior antiprolifer activ compound 19o show ic50 valu less 20 mum mgc803 sgc7901 hgc27 cell exhibit certain select compar normal ges1 cell compound 19o verifi inhibitori effect coloni format promot apoptosi hgc27 sgc7901 cell block cycl hgc27 cell g0g1 phase evalu reveal compound 19o inhibit glycolyt pathway suppress express hif1alpha key ratelimit enzym hk2 pkm2 glycolysi reduc intracellular lactat content hgc27 xenograft nude mice compound 19o abl significantli inhibit growth tumor inhibit rate dose 15 mgkg 30 mgkg 3095 6289 respect furthermor compound 19o demonstr certain safeti vivo exhibit accept pharmacokinet properti intraven administr overal benzimidazol chalcon deriv 19o synthes screen studi potenti candid drug antitumor treatment
cancer,"Despite extensive investigation into the anti-cancer activity of the natural polyphenol curcumin, its therapeutic application is restricted by its inherent physicochemical properties. Synthetic curcumin analogues, however, offer a promising strategy to improve the drug-like potential of curcumin. In this study, we evaluated three curcumin-based benzothiazepane analogues for their ability to selectively target colon cancer cells. Their cytotoxicity was assessed on intestinal cancerous HCT-116 and non-cancerous IPEC-J2 cells using cell viability assays and microscopic imaging. Two analogues, AT007 and AT096, demonstrated enhanced anti-cancer selectivity compared to curcumin. Interestingly, this effect correlated with the aggregation of these compounds in cell medium, which was influenced by compound concentration and medium composition (particularly the presence of albumin). Confocal microscopy confirmed the presence of particles up to 12 microm inside both cell lines, yet downstream metabolic and transcriptomic responses revealed distinct coping mechanisms that may underlie the higher survival of IPEC-J2 cells. Rather than direct molecular interactions typical of soluble compounds, the observed selectivity appears to result from indirect, particle-driven physical effects, potentially involving (intracellular) membrane disruption. Our findings suggest that aggregation behaviour can be a key determinant in improving the potency and selectivity of bioactive compounds, opening new opportunities for the design and screening of more selective anti-cancer therapeutics.",despit extens investig anticanc activ natur polyphenol curcumin therapeut applic restrict inher physicochem properti synthet curcumin analogu howev offer promis strategi improv druglik potenti curcumin studi evalu three curcuminbas benzothiazepan analogu abil select target colon cancer cell cytotox assess intestin cancer hct116 noncancer ipecj2 cell use cell viabil assay microscop imag two analogu at007 at096 demonstr enhanc anticanc select compar curcumin interestingli effect correl aggreg compound cell medium influenc compound concentr medium composit particularli presenc albumin confoc microscopi confirm presenc particl 12 microm insid cell line yet downstream metabol transcriptom respons reveal distinct cope mechan may underli higher surviv ipecj2 cell rather direct molecular interact typic solubl compound observ select appear result indirect particledriven physic effect potenti involv intracellular membran disrupt find suggest aggreg behaviour key determin improv potenc select bioactiv compound open new opportun design screen select anticanc therapeut
cancer,"Lung cancer remains the most prevalent and deadliest malignant tumor worldwide, and there is an urgent need to develop novel antitumor therapies to achieve satisfactory treatment outcomes. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a traditional therapeutic approach in China, and extensive clinical and basic research has shown its excellent antitumor efficacy. Dysregulation of lipid metabolism is one of the significant characteristics of malignant tumors, with mitochondria playing a crucial role. Inducers of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase/stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS/STING) pathway can influence the lipid metabolism of tumor cells. Here, we designed a polydopamine-based nanomaterial targeting mitochondria and encapsulated Cryptotanshinone to enhance cGAS/STING-mediated lipid metabolism and mitochondrial apoptosis, thereby exerting a targeted inhibitory effect on primary tumor lesions and ex vivo tumor cells. Consequently, our engineered nanosystem represents a novel strategy for promoting tumor lipid metabolism reprogramming and mitochondrial apoptosis through the modulation of the cGAS/STING pathway, thus addressing the significant challenge associated with regulating mitochondrial function to suppress Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).",lung cancer remain preval deadliest malign tumor worldwid urgent need develop novel antitumor therapi achiev satisfactori treatment outcom tradit chines medicin tcm tradit therapeut approach china extens clinic basic research shown excel antitumor efficaci dysregul lipid metabol one signific characterist malign tumor mitochondria play crucial role induc cyclic guanosin monophosphateadenosin monophosph synthasestimul interferon gene cgasst pathway influenc lipid metabol tumor cell design polydopaminebas nanomateri target mitochondria encapsul cryptotanshinon enhanc cgasstingmedi lipid metabol mitochondri apoptosi therebi exert target inhibitori effect primari tumor lesion ex vivo tumor cell consequ engin nanosystem repres novel strategi promot tumor lipid metabol reprogram mitochondri apoptosi modul cgasst pathway thu address signific challeng associ regul mitochondri function suppress nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc
cancer,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. It is known for extensive infiltration, significant variability, and a high recurrence rate. Current standard treatments include maximal surgical removal and chemoradiotherapy. However, they offer limited benefit because of the tumor's invasive nature and resistance to systemic therapies. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) also impedes the delivery of effective treatments, underscoring the urgent need for innovative therapeutic approaches and delivery systems that can bypass the BBB and target disseminated tumor cells. The chemokine CXCL12, which interacts with the CXCR4 receptor, plays an important role in GBM progression by regulating key processes, including cell migration, invasion, blood vessel formation, maintenance of glioma stem-like cells, and the immune response. The CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling pathway creates chemotactic gradients that drive GBM cell movement into healthy brain tissue. This contributes to tumor recurrence and therapy resistance. Targeting this pathway could lead to a more effective strategy for directing tumor cells toward treatment areas. Accordingly, researchers have developed CXCL12-functionalized hydrogels as new therapeutic platforms. These hydrogels can capture invasive GBM cells and provide localized, sustained-release treatments across the BBB. This review explains the role of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in GBM biology and offers a thorough overview of hydrogel-based delivery systems, focusing on chemotactic mechanisms and CXCL12-functionalized hydrogels. It also discusses ongoing challenges and outlines future steps for applying these systems in clinical settings.",glioblastoma gbm common aggress primari brain tumor known extens infiltr signific variabl high recurr rate current standard treatment includ maxim surgic remov chemoradiotherapi howev offer limit benefit tumor invas natur resist system therapi bloodbrain barrier bbb also imped deliveri effect treatment underscor urgent need innov therapeut approach deliveri system bypass bbb target dissemin tumor cell chemokin cxcl12 interact cxcr4 receptor play import role gbm progress regul key process includ cell migrat invas blood vessel format mainten glioma stemlik cell immun respons cxcl12cxcr4 signal pathway creat chemotact gradient drive gbm cell movement healthi brain tissu contribut tumor recurr therapi resist target pathway could lead effect strategi direct tumor cell toward treatment area accordingli research develop cxcl12function hydrogel new therapeut platform hydrogel captur invas gbm cell provid local sustainedreleas treatment across bbb review explain role cxcl12cxcr4 axi gbm biolog offer thorough overview hydrogelbas deliveri system focus chemotact mechan cxcl12function hydrogel also discuss ongo challeng outlin futur step appli system clinic set
cancer,"Head and neck cancers remain among the most challenging malignancies to treat and are often linked to lifestyle-related risk factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption. These factors not only initiate tumor development but also promote chronic inflammation and activate key oncogenic pathways, including NF-kappaB signaling and pro-angiogenic cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. Research into emerging therapeutic approaches has identified metal-based compounds-especially ruthenium(II) complexes-as promising alternatives to traditional platinum-based drugs. In this study, we report the design, synthesis and X-RAY characterization of a ruthenium(II) complex incorporating a quinoline-chalcone hybrid ligand, designed for enhanced anticancer and anti-inflammatory potential. The resulting compound, referred to as complex 2, demonstrated significant activity against HPV-negative head and neck cancer cell lines. It exhibited strong cytostatic, antiproliferative, and migrastatic effects, along marked suppression of NF-kappaB activation and a notable decrease in IL-6 and IL-8 levels due to direct interactions. These findings highlight complex 2 as a promising multitarget agent capable of targeting both tumor progression and the inflammatory microenvironment. Overall, complex 2 is a potential candidate for combination therapies targeting head and neck cancer.",head neck cancer remain among challeng malign treat often link lifestylerel risk factor smoke alcohol consumpt factor initi tumor develop also promot chronic inflamm activ key oncogen pathway includ nfkappab signal proangiogen cytokin il6 il8 research emerg therapeut approach identifi metalbas compoundsespeci rutheniumii complexesa promis altern tradit platinumbas drug studi report design synthesi xray character rutheniumii complex incorpor quinolinechalcon hybrid ligand design enhanc anticanc antiinflammatori potenti result compound refer complex 2 demonstr signific activ hpvneg head neck cancer cell line exhibit strong cytostat antiprolif migrastat effect along mark suppress nfkappab activ notabl decreas il6 il8 level due direct interact find highlight complex 2 promis multitarget agent capabl target tumor progress inflammatori microenviron overal complex 2 potenti candid combin therapi target head neck cancer
cancer,"BACKGROUND: This study examines whether the pan-immune inflammation value (PIV) is linked to all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer-specific mortality in individuals with a history of cancer. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were analyzed to further explore the potential mediating influence of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on the PIV-mortality relationship. METHODS: We included 3773 cancer survivors from NHANES (2003-2018). Mortality follow-up was conducted via linkage to the National Death Index. Associations between PIV and mortality outcomes were assessed using restricted cubic spline curves and weighted multivariable Cox regression. Mediation analysis evaluated whether eGFR partly explains the effect of PIV on mortality. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 84.75 months, 1137 deaths occurred (all-cause: 30.14 %; CVD: 8.32 %; cancer: 9.09 %). Using an optimal cutoff of 344.63, participants were classified into low (n = 2335) and high PIV (n = 1438) groups. In fully adjusted models, high PIV was associated with increased risks of all-cause mortality (HR 1.36, 95 % CI 1.18-1.56) and cancer-related mortality (HR 1.42, 95 % CI 1.10-1.82). eGFR mediated 9.10 % of the association between PIV and all-cause mortality and 11.47 % for CVD mortality, but not significantly for cancer mortality.

cancer,"OBJECTIVES: Helicobacter pylori infection seems to increase the risk of developing pancreatic cancer, but it is unknown whether eradication treatment of this bacterium changes this risk. We hypothesized that the increased risk of pancreatic cancer among individuals infected with Helicobacter pylori decreases over time after eradication treatment. METHODS: This multinational and population-based cohort study, using prospectively collected nationwide register data from 1995 to 2019, included all adults who received eradication treatment for Helicobacter pylori in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, or Sweden. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 %CI) were calculated by dividing the incidence rates of pancreatic cancer in the eradication treatment cohort by that of the entire populations of the corresponding age, sex, calendar year, and country. The main outcome was changes in SIR over time after eradication treatment. RESULTS: During up to 24 years of follow-up of 661,827 participants and 5494,255 person-years in the eradication treatment cohort, 2331 participants developed pancreatic cancer. The risk of pancreatic cancer was increased during the first 1-5 years after eradication treatment (SIR 1.14, 95 % CI 1.07-1.21), after which it decreased and became similar to the level of the background population 6-10 years (SIR 0.99, 95 % CI 0.92-1.07) and 11-24 years (SIR 1.00, 95 % CI 0.92-1.08) after eradication treatment. CONCLUSION: The elevated risk of developing pancreatic cancer among individuals with Helicobacter pylori infection seems to decrease after eradication treatment, reaching the risk estimates of the background population.",object helicobact pylori infect seem increas risk develop pancreat cancer unknown whether erad treatment bacterium chang risk hypothes increas risk pancreat cancer among individu infect helicobact pylori decreas time erad treatment method multin populationbas cohort studi use prospect collect nationwid regist data 1995 2019 includ adult receiv erad treatment helicobact pylori denmark finland iceland norway sweden standard incid ratio sir 95 confid interv 95 ci calcul divid incid rate pancreat cancer erad treatment cohort entir popul correspond age sex calendar year countri main outcom chang sir time erad treatment result 24 year followup 661827 particip 5494255 personyear erad treatment cohort 2331 particip develop pancreat cancer risk pancreat cancer increas first 15 year erad treatment sir 114 95 ci 107121 decreas becam similar level background popul 610 year sir 099 95 ci 092107 1124 year sir 100 95 ci 092108 erad treatment conclus elev risk develop pancreat cancer among individu helicobact pylori infect seem decreas erad treatment reach risk estim background popul
cancer,"Autophagy is a fundamental, highly conserved cellular process with a complex dual role in breast cancer progression and therapy resistance. Initially, autophagy functions as a tumor suppressor by maintaining genomic stability through clearance of damaged organelles and reducing oxidative stress, preventing tumor initiation. In established tumors, autophagy supports cancer cell survival under metabolic stress, sustains cancer stem cell stemness, and facilitates adaptation to hypoxia and nutrient deprivation in the tumor microenvironment. This pro-survival role enhances tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapies. Autophagy extensively interacts with key signaling pathways governing cancer stem cell renewal and immune evasion, underscoring its multifaceted impact on tumor biology. Given its pivotal role, autophagy modulation via established inhibitors such as chloroquine alone and in combination with several other novel agents are under clinical investigation to investigate if its action that could be used to overcome therapy resistance and improve patient outcomes in breast cancer.",autophagi fundament highli conserv cellular process complex dual role breast cancer progress therapi resist initi autophagi function tumor suppressor maintain genom stabil clearanc damag organel reduc oxid stress prevent tumor initi establish tumor autophagi support cancer cell surviv metabol stress sustain cancer stem cell stem facilit adapt hypoxia nutrient depriv tumor microenviron prosurviv role enhanc tumor growth metastasi resist chemotherapi radiotherapi target therapi autophagi extens interact key signal pathway govern cancer stem cell renew immun evas underscor multifacet impact tumor biolog given pivot role autophagi modul via establish inhibitor chloroquin alon combin sever novel agent clinic investig investig action could use overcom therapi resist improv patient outcom breast cancer
cancer,"Hyaluronidase 1 (HYAL1), a key enzyme in hyaluronic acid (HA) metabolism, exhibits a perplexing paradoxical character in tumor biology. This review systematically delineates the dual roles of HYAL1 in cancer: on one hand, by degrading HA to generate low-molecular-weight fragments with pro-angiogenic and immunomodulatory activities, HYAL1 promotes tumor progression and metastasis in various malignancies, including prostate cancer, esophageal carcinoma, and osteosarcoma; on the other hand, it demonstrates tumor-suppressive properties in specific contexts such as colorectal cancer models. This functional contradiction underscores the context-dependent nature of HYAL1, whose activity and effects are profoundly influenced by tumor type, microenvironmental features, and epigenetic regulation. Mechanistically, HYAL1 functions not only through the classical HA-CD44 signaling axis but also by regulating the MMPs/TIMPs balance, integrin activation, and cytoskeletal reorganization. Recent studies reveal that HYAL1 expression is directly controlled by epigenetic regulators like BRD2, while its activity can be monitored in real-time using novel bioluminescent probes, providing powerful tools for investigating its dynamic functions. Notably, HYAL1-based therapeutic strategies have shown considerable promise, particularly in oncolytic virotherapy, where HYAL1-expressing recombinant viruses significantly enhance the penetration and efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents and immune cells within tumors. Key challenges persist, including HA metabolic complexity, functional redundancy among hyaluronidases, and HA fragment instability. Future research must decipher HYAL1's context-specific roles within tumor heterogeneity, elucidate its epigenetic regulation, and develop targeted strategies. A deeper understanding of this HYAL1 paradox is essential to leverage its potential for precision cancer therapies targeting HA metabolism.",hyaluronidas 1 hyal1 key enzym hyaluron acid ha metabol exhibit perplex paradox charact tumor biolog review systemat delin dual role hyal1 cancer one hand degrad ha gener lowmolecularweight fragment proangiogen immunomodulatori activ hyal1 promot tumor progress metastasi variou malign includ prostat cancer esophag carcinoma osteosarcoma hand demonstr tumorsuppress properti specif context colorect cancer model function contradict underscor contextdepend natur hyal1 whose activ effect profoundli influenc tumor type microenvironment featur epigenet regul mechanist hyal1 function classic hacd44 signal axi also regul mmpstimp balanc integrin activ cytoskelet reorgan recent studi reveal hyal1 express directli control epigenet regul like brd2 activ monitor realtim use novel bioluminesc probe provid power tool investig dynam function notabl hyal1bas therapeut strategi shown consider promis particularli oncolyt virotherapi hyal1express recombin virus significantli enhanc penetr efficaci chemotherapeut agent immun cell within tumor key challeng persist includ ha metabol complex function redund among hyaluronidas ha fragment instabl futur research must deciph hyal1 contextspecif role within tumor heterogen elucid epigenet regul develop target strategi deeper understand hyal1 paradox essenti leverag potenti precis cancer therapi target ha metabol
cancer,"The growing digitization of healthcare services has led to an abundance of textual patient feedback, offering a unique opportunity to assess healthcare quality through sentiment analysis. While most existing research focuses on English-language data, non-English contexts - especially Arabic dialects - remain underexplored. This study introduces JADKHCC, a novel corpus specifically designed for sentiment analysis of patient feedback written in the Jordanian Arabic dialect, collected from King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC). The corpus is manually annotated using a comprehensive methodology to capture sentiments on both three- and five-point Likert scales. This study analyzes 15,812 Jordanian Arabic Dialect comments by employing various pre-processing techniques and feature vectors, including BERT-base-Arabic, Word2Vec, and FastText. Furthermore, the study considers a wide range of deep learning classifiers alongside balancing techniques to address data imbalance. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the CNN with BERT representation model compared to the BiLSTM, LSTM, RNN, and RNNLSTM models. The findings indicate an F1-score of approximately 96%, suggesting the potential for predicting patient sentiment from textual feedback. By automating feedback analysis, this approach enables KHCC to detect dissatisfaction, identify unmet needs, and act on key concerns promptly. It reduces the burden of manual review and supports data-driven service improvements-advancing KHCC's mission to deliver responsive, high-quality, patient-centered cancer care.",grow digit healthcar servic led abund textual patient feedback offer uniqu opportun assess healthcar qualiti sentiment analysi exist research focus englishlanguag data nonenglish context especi arab dialect remain underexplor studi introduc jadkhcc novel corpu specif design sentiment analysi patient feedback written jordanian arab dialect collect king hussein cancer center khcc corpu manual annot use comprehens methodolog captur sentiment three fivepoint likert scale studi analyz 15812 jordanian arab dialect comment employ variou preprocess techniqu featur vector includ bertbasearab word2vec fasttext furthermor studi consid wide rang deep learn classifi alongsid balanc techniqu address data imbal result demonstr superior perform cnn bert represent model compar bilstm lstm rnn rnnlstm model find indic f1score approxim 96 suggest potenti predict patient sentiment textual feedback autom feedback analysi approach enabl khcc detect dissatisfact identifi unmet need act key concern promptli reduc burden manual review support datadriven servic improvementsadvanc khcc mission deliv respons highqual patientcent cancer care
cancer,"A series of imidazolium-derived N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands (L1-L3), their selenium adducts (C1-C3) and corresponding silver-NHC complexes (C4-C6) were synthesized and characterized, and their electronic properties and biological potentials were investigated. The imidazolium salts were prepared by N-alkylation of 1-phenethyl-1H-imidazole and converted to selenium adducts via treatment with elemental selenium and to Ag-NHC complexes using Ag(2)O. Structures were characterized by FT-IR, (1)H/(13)C NMR and computational methods. DFT calculations provided frontier orbital energies and global descriptors, showing increased HOMO-LUMO gaps on metal coordination and trends consistent with enhanced stability of Ag complexes. Molecular docking of the selenium adducts against human AKR1C2 (PDB: 4XO6) indicated modest binding (DeltaG  approximately  -5.3 kcal.mol(-1)) compared with 5-fluorouracil (-6.8 kcal.mol(-1)). Biological screening against MCF-7 cancer cells found higher antiproliferative activity for Ag complexes (IC(50)  approximately  13.7 mug.mL(-1)) than for selenium adducts or salts. The Ag-NHCs also exhibited potent antibacterial activity (MICs  approximately  5-6 muM against E. coli and S. aureus), whereas selenium adduct C2 showed the strongest antioxidant (DPPH) activity (IC(50)  approximately  4.9-5.5 mug.mL(-1)).",seri imidazoliumderiv nheterocycl carben nhc ligand l1l3 selenium adduct c1c3 correspond silvernhc complex c4c6 synthes character electron properti biolog potenti investig imidazolium salt prepar nalkyl 1phenethyl1himidazol convert selenium adduct via treatment element selenium agnhc complex use ag2o structur character ftir 1h13c nmr comput method dft calcul provid frontier orbit energi global descriptor show increas homolumo gap metal coordin trend consist enhanc stabil ag complex molecular dock selenium adduct human akr1c2 pdb 4xo6 indic modest bind deltag approxim 53 kcalmol1 compar 5fluorouracil 68 kcalmol1 biolog screen mcf7 cancer cell found higher antiprolif activ ag complex ic50 approxim 137 mugml1 selenium adduct salt agnhc also exhibit potent antibacteri activ mic approxim 56 mum e coli aureu wherea selenium adduct c2 show strongest antioxid dpph activ ic50 approxim 4955 mugml1
cancer,"Alepterolic acid, a labdane diterpenoid derived from Aleuritopteris argentea (S. G. Gmel.) Fee, has demonstrated promising biological properties that make it potentially useful for anticancer therapies. This research designed and synthesized a series of twenty-one novel derivatives of alepterolic acid featuring dihydroindole scaffolds, and assessed their anticancer potential in vitro. Among these compounds, the derivative incorporating a 1-(6-iodoindolin-1-yl) substituent (compound 9k) exhibited superior inhibitory activity against the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB-231, showing an IC(50) value of 94.30 +/- 3.26 nM. Subsequent mechanistic analyses revealed that compound 9k significantly suppressed colony formation, inhibited cellular migration, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and promoted apoptosis via reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Moreover, in vivo experiments indicated that this derivative effectively restrained tumor growth without noticeable toxic side effects. Finally, utilizing network pharmacology and molecular docking approaches, we elucidated the potential mechanism by which compound 9k induced apoptosis in TNBC cells and identified ten key core genes involved in this process. These results collectively highlight the potential of alepterolic acid derivatives as promising therapeutic candidates for TNBC.",alepterol acid labdan diterpenoid deriv aleuritopteri argentea g gmel fee demonstr promis biolog properti make potenti use anticanc therapi research design synthes seri twentyon novel deriv alepterol acid featur dihydroindol scaffold assess anticanc potenti vitro among compound deriv incorpor 16iodoindolin1yl substitu compound 9k exhibit superior inhibitori activ tripleneg breast cancer tnbc cell line mdamb231 show ic50 valu 9430 326 nm subsequ mechanist analys reveal compound 9k significantli suppress coloni format inhibit cellular migrat decreas mitochondri membran potenti mmp promot apoptosi via reactiv oxygen speci ro gener moreov vivo experi indic deriv effect restrain tumor growth without notic toxic side effect final util network pharmacolog molecular dock approach elucid potenti mechan compound 9k induc apoptosi tnbc cell identifi ten key core gene involv process result collect highlight potenti alepterol acid deriv promis therapeut candid tnbc

Nitrogen (N-) and sulfur (S-) heteroatom-doped carbon quantum dots (CQ-dot) were prepared in one step microwave treatment within 3 min as a fluorescence and photoinduced antipathogenic nanomaterial. The N/S-doped CQ-dots were spherical shaped and < 50 nm via TEM images and showed high fluorescence intensity with 420 nm emission wavelength at maximum lambda(ex):350 nm. The N/S-doped CQ-dots were embedded into ionically crosslinked hyaluronic acid (HA) microgels, employing trivalent metal ions Gd(III) or Fe(III) ions. The prepared CQ-dot@HA-Gd/Fe(III) microgels <5 mm size range are injectable for possible intravenous administration and possess high fluorescent properties. The isoelectric point (IEP) of CQ-dot@HA-Gd and CQ-dot@HA-Fe(III) microgels was determined as pH 1.45. The CQ-dot@HA-Gd/Fe(III) microgels exhibit excellent hemocompatibility without causing noticeable hemolysis and blood clotting at concentrations up to 500 mg/mL. Furthermore, the toxicity of CQ-dot@HA-Gd/Fe(III) microgels on L929 fibroblast cells was found as 100 mg/mL concentration and provide brilliant cell imaging under DAPI filter without any fluorescence dye. Also, the CQ-dot@HA-Gd/Fe(III) microgel suspension afforded great MRI contrast enhancement ability. Photoinduced anticancer activity was observed for CQ-dot@HA-Gd/Fe(III) microgels even at 50 mg/mL against SK-MEL 30 melanoma cells under UV-A light treatment for 30 min. In addition, high reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was obtained for the pathogenic bacteria cells by light-sensitive CQ-dot@HA-Gd/Fe(III) microgels upon 30 min UV-A light treatment that triggered the destruction of the Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538).",studi report develop multifunct cqdothagdfeiii microgel readili simultan use fluorescencemr dualmod imag photodynam therapi theragnost agent nitrogen n sulfur heteroatomdop carbon quantum dot cqdot prepar one step microwav treatment within 3 min fluoresc photoinduc antipathogen nanomateri nsdope cqdot spheric shape 50 nm via tem imag show high fluoresc intens 420 nm emiss wavelength maximum lambdaex350 nm nsdope cqdot embed ionic crosslink hyaluron acid ha microgel employ trival metal ion gdiii feiii ion prepar cqdothagdfeiii microgel 5 mm size rang inject possibl intraven administr possess high fluoresc properti isoelectr point iep cqdothagd cqdothafeiii microgel determin ph 145 cqdothagdfeiii microgel exhibit excel hemocompat without caus notic hemolysi blood clot concentr 500 mgml furthermor toxic cqdothagdfeiii microgel l929 fibroblast cell found 100 mgml concentr provid brilliant cell imag dapi filter without fluoresc dye also cqdothagdfeiii microgel suspens afford great mri contrast enhanc abil photoinduc anticanc activ observ cqdothagdfeiii microgel even 50 mgml skmel 30 melanoma cell uva light treatment 30 min addit high reactiv oxygen speci ro gener obtain pathogen bacteria cell lightsensit cqdothagdfeiii microgel upon 30 min uva light treatment trigger destruct staphylococcu aureu atcc 6538
cancer,"Endoxifen is the most powerful metabolite of tamoxifen (TX), the main endocrine therapy administered worldwide for the treatment of estrogen-receptor (ER) positive metastatic breast cancer. Tamoxifen itself is a prodrug with weak affinity for ER, but it is converted into endoxifen, with up to 100-fold higher affinity for ER than TX. In this study, we introduce the first fluorescent endoxifen derivative (FLTX3), formed by covalent attachment of the small fluorophore NBD to the basic side chain of endoxifen. We have characterized the optical properties of FLTX3, demonstrating its ability as a laser dye. FLTX3 is an efficient target-directed fluorescent probe for the cellular labelling of ER in MCF7 breast cancer cell line as well as in uterine tissues. FLTX3 is also endowed with an intrinsic photodynamic effect when irradiated at the optimal excitation wavelength of FLTX3. Further, we show that FLTX3 has an optical gain behaviour that leads to random laser (RL) when the light emitted by the drug is scattered in the cell cultures. Indeed, analyses of coherent spectra by power function Fourier transform revealed a RL dominant cavity in the range of average cell sizes. As one of the main causes for tamoxifen treatment failure is resistance, we explored the potential discriminative value of FLTX3-induced RL between tamoxifen-resistant and tamoxifen-sensitive MCF7 cells. Using multivariate approaches, we unravelled significant differences in the RL signal between tamoxifen-sensitive and tamoxifen-resistant cells. These findings indicate that FLTX3-generated RL might provide a target-directed diagnostic tool for tamoxifen resistance in metastatic ER+ breast cancer.",endoxifen power metabolit tamoxifen tx main endocrin therapi administ worldwid treatment estrogenreceptor er posit metastat breast cancer tamoxifen prodrug weak affin er convert endoxifen 100fold higher affin er tx studi introduc first fluoresc endoxifen deriv fltx3 form coval attach small fluorophor nbd basic side chain endoxifen character optic properti fltx3 demonstr abil laser dye fltx3 effici targetdirect fluoresc probe cellular label er mcf7 breast cancer cell line well uterin tissu fltx3 also endow intrins photodynam effect irradi optim excit wavelength fltx3 show fltx3 optic gain behaviour lead random laser rl light emit drug scatter cell cultur inde analys coher spectra power function fourier transform reveal rl domin caviti rang averag cell size one main caus tamoxifen treatment failur resist explor potenti discrimin valu fltx3induc rl tamoxifenresist tamoxifensensit mcf7 cell use multivari approach unravel signific differ rl signal tamoxifensensit tamoxifenresist cell find indic fltx3gener rl might provid targetdirect diagnost tool tamoxifen resist metastat er breast cancer
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Expert pathology review plays a crucial role in gynecologic oncology, where diagnostic complexity can substantially affect patient management and medico-legal accountability. This study aimed to assess the frequency, nature, and impact of diagnostic revisions arising from second opinion evaluations of gynecologic lesions. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 319 consecutive cases of gynecologic lesions submitted for second opinion review by a senior gynecologic pathologist at a tertiary referral center between 2018 and 2024. Each case was categorized as concordant, minorly discrepant, or majorly discrepant compared with the referring diagnosis. Clinical impact and medico-legal relevance were systematically evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 319 reviewed cases, 47.0% were fully concordant with the original diagnosis, whereas 34.5% exhibited major discrepancies and 18.5% minor discrepancies. The most frequent sources of diagnostic disagreement involved tumor histotype, grade, and determination of the primary site. Ovarian and endometrial specimens accounted for most revisions. Diagnostic reinterpretation led to changes in clinical management in 54.9% of cases, and potential medico-legal implications were identified in 11.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Expert second opinion pathology in gynecologic oncology revealed a high rate of diagnostically and clinically significant revisions. Routine implementation of specialist review for complex or high-risk gynecologic lesions is strongly recommended to improve diagnostic accuracy, guide appropriate patient care, and reduce medico-legal risk.",object expert patholog review play crucial role gynecolog oncolog diagnost complex substanti affect patient manag medicoleg account studi aim assess frequenc natur impact diagnost revis aris second opinion evalu gynecolog lesion method retrospect analyz 319 consecut case gynecolog lesion submit second opinion review senior gynecolog pathologist tertiari referr center 2018 2024 case categor concord minorli discrep majorli discrep compar refer diagnosi clinic impact medicoleg relev systemat evalu result 319 review case 470 fulli concord origin diagnosi wherea 345 exhibit major discrep 185 minor discrep frequent sourc diagnost disagr involv tumor histotyp grade determin primari site ovarian endometri specimen account revis diagnost reinterpret led chang clinic manag 549 case potenti medicoleg implic identifi 113 conclus expert second opinion patholog gynecolog oncolog reveal high rate diagnost clinic signific revis routin implement specialist review complex highrisk gynecolog lesion strongli recommend improv diagnost accuraci guid appropri patient care reduc medicoleg risk
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Substantial metabolic reprogramming accompanies the transition from cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet the metabolomic profile of cirrhotic liver tissue containing HCC remains insufficiently defined. METHODS: Metabolomic data from 203 cirrhotic tissue samples and 37 HCC tissue samples were obtained from the MetaboLights repository (dataset MTBLS8764). Multivariate statistical approaches, including principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), were applied to delineate metabolic differences between groups. Discriminatory metabolites were identified using variable importance in projection (VIP) scores and fold-change analysis. Diagnostic performance was assessed through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for both individual metabolites and multi-metabolite panels. Complementary transcriptomic data were subjected to KEGG pathway enrichment and an integrated multi-omics evaluation to uncover biological pathways underlying disease progression. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses revealed significant metabolic divergence between cirrhotic and HCC tissues. PCA and supervised PLS-DA showed distinct group separation, and the OPLS-DA model demonstrated strong reliability (R(2)Y = 0.694, Q(2) = 0.39; p < 0.001). Fifty-seven metabolites showed significant differential abundance. ROC analysis indicated that combining four metabolites, 6-bromotryptophan, threonate, palmitoylcholine, and oleoylcholine, significantly improved diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.83, p < 0.001). KEGG enrichment analysis of metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets identified disrupted pathways in amino acid metabolism, oxidative stress, and lipid remodeling. Integrated multi-omics analysis further revealed coordinated alterations in the ""choline metabolism in cancer"" pathway, implicating this axis as a key contributor to HCC development. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive metabolomic framework identifies promising biomarkers and distinct metabolic signatures that differentiate cirrhosis from HCC and offers mechanistic insights to guide future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",background substanti metabol reprogram accompani transit cirrhosi hepatocellular carcinoma hcc yet metabolom profil cirrhot liver tissu contain hcc remain insuffici defin method metabolom data 203 cirrhot tissu sampl 37 hcc tissu sampl obtain metabolight repositori dataset mtbls8764 multivari statist approach includ princip compon analysi pca partial least squar discrimin analysi plsda orthogon partial least squar discrimin analysi oplsda appli delin metabol differ group discriminatori metabolit identifi use variabl import project vip score foldchang analysi diagnost perform assess receiv oper characterist roc curv analysi individu metabolit multimetabolit panel complementari transcriptom data subject kegg pathway enrich integr multiom evalu uncov biolog pathway underli diseas progress result multivari analys reveal signific metabol diverg cirrhot hcc tissu pca supervis plsda show distinct group separ oplsda model demonstr strong reliabl r2i 0694 q2 039 p 0001 fiftyseven metabolit show signific differenti abund roc analysi indic combin four metabolit 6bromotryptophan threonat palmitoylcholin oleoylcholin significantli improv diagnost accuraci auc 083 p 0001 kegg enrich analysi metabolom transcriptom dataset identifi disrupt pathway amino acid metabol oxid stress lipid remodel integr multiom analysi reveal coordin alter cholin metabol cancer pathway implic axi key contributor hcc develop conclus comprehens metabolom framework identifi promis biomark distinct metabol signatur differenti cirrhosi hcc offer mechanist insight guid futur diagnost therapeut strategi
cancer,"BACKGROUND: The optimal integration of immunotherapy with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains an area of active investigation. While consolidation immunotherapy is standard, the efficacy and safety of a neoadjuvant approach are not yet established by phase III trials. This real-world study compares outcomes between neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy followed by CRT (NEO) and CRT followed by adjuvant immunotherapy (ADJ, the PACIFIC regimen). METHODS: In this multicenter retrospective analysis, we reviewed data from patients with stage III NSCLC who received radical thoracic radiotherapy and peri-radiotherapy immunotherapy between January 2020 and December 2023. Patients were classified into NEO (n = 321) or ADJ (n = 142) groups. Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included treatment patterns, recurrence modes, and incidence of pneumonitis. Propensity score matching (PSM) and robust statistical analyses were used to minimize confounding. RESULTS: The median PFS was significantly longer in the NEO group than in the ADJ group (25.0 months vs. 16.3 months; HR = 0.57, 95 % CI: 0.43-0.74; p < 0.001). Median OS was not reached (NR) in the NEO group compared to 41.1 months in the ADJ group (HR = 0.54, 95 % CI: 0.37-0.78; p = 0.001). The survival benefit for the NEO group remained consistent after PSM and multivariable adjustment. The objective response rate to neoadjuvant therapy was 68.4 %. Patterns of recurrence were similar between groups, with distant metastasis being the most common site of first progression. The incidence of grade >/=2 radiation pneumonitis was comparable (31.8 % NEO vs. 30.8 % ADJ, p = 0.925), though a non-significant trend towards higher grade >/=3 radiation pneumonitis was observed in the NEO group (14.0 % vs. 7.5 %, p = 0.071). Rates of checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis were low and similar between groups. CONCLUSION: In this large real-world cohort, a treatment sequence incorporating neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy prior to definitive CRT was associated with significantly improved PFS and OS compared to the standard adjuvant immunotherapy approach, without a definitive increase in severe pneumonitis. These findings support the further investigation of neoadjuvant immunotherapy strategies in phase III randomized trials for stage III NSCLC.",background optim integr immunotherapi definit chemoradiotherapi crt unresect stage iii nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc remain area activ investig consolid immunotherapi standard efficaci safeti neoadjuv approach yet establish phase iii trial realworld studi compar outcom neoadjuv immunochemotherapi follow crt neo crt follow adjuv immunotherapi adj pacif regimen method multicent retrospect analysi review data patient stage iii nsclc receiv radic thorac radiotherapi periradiotherapi immunotherapi januari 2020 decemb 2023 patient classifi neo n 321 adj n 142 group primari endpoint progressionfre surviv pf overal surviv os secondari endpoint includ treatment pattern recurr mode incid pneumon propens score match psm robust statist analys use minim confound result median pf significantli longer neo group adj group 250 month vs 163 month hr 057 95 ci 043074 p 0001 median os reach nr neo group compar 411 month adj group hr 054 95 ci 037078 p 0001 surviv benefit neo group remain consist psm multivari adjust object respons rate neoadjuv therapi 684 pattern recurr similar group distant metastasi common site first progress incid grade 2 radiat pneumon compar 318 neo vs 308 adj p 0925 though nonsignific trend toward higher grade 3 radiat pneumon observ neo group 140 vs 75 p 0071 rate checkpoint inhibitor pneumon low similar group conclus larg realworld cohort treatment sequenc incorpor neoadjuv immunochemotherapi prior definit crt associ significantli improv pf os compar standard adjuv immunotherapi approach without definit increas sever pneumon find support investig neoadjuv immunotherapi strategi phase iii random trial stage iii nsclc
cancer,"BACKGROUND: The identification of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) patients who may benefit from first-line chemo-immunotherapy (CIT) remains a challenge. This study aimed to develop a pathomics model to predict the T cell-inflamed gene-expression profile (GEP) status and validate its utility in identifying patients who derive survival benefit from CIT. METHODS: The pathomics model was developed using whole-slide images and RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) LUSC cohort (n = 334) to predict the GEP status and generate a pathomics score (PS). The predictive value of PS was validated in a prospective, multicenter trial (AK105-302, n = 267) by assessing its interaction with treatment (CIT vs. chemotherapy) for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Two additional independent cohorts (n = 82 and n = 50) were used for external validation. RESULTS: The pathomics model accurately predicted GEP status, achieving area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.80 and 0.71 in the TCGA training and validation sets, respectively. In the AK105-302 cohort, significant interactions were identified between PS and treatment modalities for both PFS (interaction p = 0.011) and OS (interaction p < 0.001). Patients with high PS who received CIT exhibited significantly prolonged PFS (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.31, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.21-0.48, p < 0.001) and OS (HR: 0.30, 95 % CI: 0.18-0.50, p < 0.001) compared to high PS patients receiving chemotherapy. However, this survival benefit was not observed in the low-PS patients. These findings were corroborated in two independent clinical cohorts. Furthermore, biological assessments revealed a significant association between high PS and an immune-hot tumor microenvironment. CONCLUSION: We developed a GEP-based pathomics model that provides a practical, cost-effective strategy to identify patients most likely to derive superior survival benefit from first-line CIT over chemotherapy alone.",background identif lung squamou cell carcinoma lusc patient may benefit firstlin chemoimmunotherapi cit remain challeng studi aim develop pathom model predict cellinflam geneexpress profil gep statu valid util identifi patient deriv surviv benefit cit method pathom model develop use wholeslid imag rnasequenc data cancer genom atla tcga lusc cohort n 334 predict gep statu gener pathom score ps predict valu ps valid prospect multicent trial ak105302 n 267 assess interact treatment cit vs chemotherapi progressionfre surviv pf overal surviv os two addit independ cohort n 82 n 50 use extern valid result pathom model accur predict gep statu achiev area curv auc valu 080 071 tcga train valid set respect ak105302 cohort signific interact identifi ps treatment modal pf interact p 0011 os interact p 0001 patient high ps receiv cit exhibit significantli prolong pf hazard ratio hr 031 95 confid interv ci 021048 p 0001 os hr 030 95 ci 018050 p 0001 compar high ps patient receiv chemotherapi howev surviv benefit observ lowp patient find corrobor two independ clinic cohort furthermor biolog assess reveal signific associ high ps immunehot tumor microenviron conclus develop gepbas pathom model provid practic costeffect strategi identifi patient like deriv superior surviv benefit firstlin cit chemotherapi alon
cancer,"Primary care is pivotal in identifying eligible participants for Australia's National Lung Cancer Screening Program (NLCSP). Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) can assist by flagging potentially eligible individuals using Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data. We developed a CDSS to identify people aged 50-70 who currently or formerly smoked cigarettes (with an unknown quit date or cessation within the past 10 years) for use in Australian general practice EMRs. This study aimed to: (1) assess the algorithm's accuracy in identifying eligible patients, (2) estimate NLCSP eligibility based on audited EMR smoking data, and (3) evaluate EMR data quality for applying the PLCO(m2012) risk prediction tool. A cross-sectional EMR audit was conducted across five Victorian general practices. Of 4,186 records flagged by the CDSS, 1,315 (31.4 %) were manually audited. The algorithm correctly identified all patients according to its rules (age and smoking status). Pack-year could be calculated for 226 patients (17.2 %), with 91 (6.9 %) meeting NLCSP eligibility. Eligibility was higher among people who currently smoke (9.2 %) than those who formerly smoked (3.6 %). A subset of 933 records was assessed for PLCOm2012 variables, revealing substantial data gaps (% missing): education level (100 %), ethnicity (58 %), BMI (57 %), and daily cigarette consumption (33 %). CDSS algorithms can identify potential NLCSP participants, but confirmation of smoking history remains essential due to sub-optimal smoking data quality.

cancer,"PURPOSES: To explore the prognostic value of dual-tracer PET/CT-derived parameters and develop a predictive model for castration-resistant prostate cancer-free survival (CRPC-FS) in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). METHODS: Forty-five mHSPC patients who underwent prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT prior to novel hormone therapy (NHT) were included between October 2020 and March 2024. A total of 1,661 PSMA-positive and 303 FDG-positive lesions were evaluated to quantify tumor burden, including maximum standardized uptake value, metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion uptake under different relative fixed threshold values. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses assessed their association with CRPC-FS. Internal validation was performed using 1000-bootstrap resampling. Classification and regression tree identified optimal cut-offs. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analysis evaluated model discrimination. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, only MTV of prostate cancer was significantly associated with CRPC-FS (p < 0.05). PSMA-derived (C-index = 0.662) MTV and FDG-derived (C-index = 0.712) MTV under a 40 % threshold exhibited the strongest predictive power and remained independent in multivariable analysis. Internal validation demonstrated favorable model performance and good calibration. The cut-off values for the two parameters were identified as 4.77 and 66.425, respectively. Furthermore, patients were stratified into prognostic groups to develop a risk model with AUCs > 0.85. CONCLUSIONS: MTV exhibited superior prognostic value for CRPC-FS in patients with mHSPC compared to other PET/CT-derived and clinical parameters. Moreover, FDG-derived MTV showed stronger prognostic value than PSMA-derived MTV. The dual-tracer PET/CT-derived model could comprehensively assess tumor burden and aid in early prognostic stratification.",purpos explor prognost valu dualtrac petctderiv paramet develop predict model castrationresist prostat cancerfre surviv crpcf patient metastat hormonesensit prostat cancer mhspc method fortyf mhspc patient underw prostatespecif membran antigen psma fluorodeoxyglucos fdg petct prior novel hormon therapi nht includ octob 2020 march 2024 total 1661 psmaposit 303 fdgposit lesion evalu quantifi tumor burden includ maximum standard uptak valu metabol tumor volum mtv total lesion uptak differ rel fix threshold valu cox regress kaplanmei analys assess associ crpcf intern valid perform use 1000bootstrap resampl classif regress tree identifi optim cutoff timedepend receiv oper characterist analysi evalu model discrimin result univari analysi mtv prostat cancer significantli associ crpcf p 005 psmaderiv cindex 0662 mtv fdgderiv cindex 0712 mtv 40 threshold exhibit strongest predict power remain independ multivari analysi intern valid demonstr favor model perform good calibr cutoff valu two paramet identifi 477 66425 respect furthermor patient stratifi prognost group develop risk model auc 085 conclus mtv exhibit superior prognost valu crpcf patient mhspc compar petctderiv clinic paramet moreov fdgderiv mtv show stronger prognost valu psmaderiv mtv dualtrac petctderiv model could comprehens assess tumor burden aid earli prognost stratif
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Exophiala dermatitidis is a ubiquitous black fungus found in the environment, but the clinical characteristics of E. dermatitidis in respiratory diseases without cystic fibrosis (CF) remain unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of non-CF patients who had E. dermatitidis isolated from respiratory specimens. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled in the study. E. dermatitidis was isolated from sputum aspirated by bronchoscopy (n = 6), sputum (n = 5), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (n = 1), and empyema pus (n = 1). Preceding pulmonary comorbidities included bronchiectasis (n = 6), COPD (n = 4), nontuberculous Mycobacterium (NTM) infection (n = 3), lung cancer (n = 2), interstitial lung disease (ILD) (n = 2), and asthma (n = 2). Non-pulmonary immunosuppressive comorbidities included diabetes (n = 4), immunosuppressive drug use (n = 3), and malignancies treated with chemotherapy (n = 2). Six patients (46.2 %) were defined as ""definite"" infection and seven (53.8 %) were as ""possible"" infection. Levels of serum beta-D-glucan (cut-off <20 pg/mL) were elevated in two of 10 patients. Chest CT showed various shadows such as bronchiectasis (n = 9), infiltrative shadow (n = 9), and mucoid impaction (n = 8). Among six patients who were treated with itraconazole (ITCZ), three patients improved, one was unchanged, and two worsened. Despite ITCZ therapy, one patient died due to exacerbation of ILD. In the non-treated group, two patients died due to advanced lung cancer. NTM was also detected with E. dermatitidis in three patients. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that E. dermatitidis may cause respiratory infections in patients with bronchiectasis or immunocompromised conditions. Further studies are needed to distinguish colonization from true infection of E. dermatitidis in the respiratory tract.",background exophiala dermatitidi ubiquit black fungu found environ clinic characterist e dermatitidi respiratori diseas without cystic fibrosi cf remain unclear method retrospect analyz clinic data noncf patient e dermatitidi isol respiratori specimen result thirteen patient enrol studi e dermatitidi isol sputum aspir bronchoscopi n 6 sputum n 5 bronchoalveolar lavag fluid n 1 empyema pu n 1 preced pulmonari comorbid includ bronchiectasi n 6 copd n 4 nontubercul mycobacterium ntm infect n 3 lung cancer n 2 interstiti lung diseas ild n 2 asthma n 2 nonpulmonari immunosuppress comorbid includ diabet n 4 immunosuppress drug use n 3 malign treat chemotherapi n 2 six patient 462 defin definit infect seven 538 possibl infect level serum betadglucan cutoff 20 pgml elev two 10 patient chest ct show variou shadow bronchiectasi n 9 infiltr shadow n 9 mucoid impact n 8 among six patient treat itraconazol itcz three patient improv one unchang two worsen despit itcz therapi one patient die due exacerb ild nontreat group two patient die due advanc lung cancer ntm also detect e dermatitidi three patient conclus data suggest e dermatitidi may caus respiratori infect patient bronchiectasi immunocompromis condit studi need distinguish colon true infect e dermatitidi respiratori tract
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most prevalent cancers among women in the worldwide. Multiple sclerosis (MS) plays an important role not only in pathogenesis but also in the antitumour response. Therefore, we investigated the causal relationship and pathogenesis between BC and MS via integrated Mendelian randomization (MR) and bioinformatics analysis. METHODS: We performed MR analyses to investigate the potential causal relationship between BC and MS via the IEU database. A comprehensive strategy among least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, support vector machine, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, time ROC regression, and survival analysis was adopted to construct and validate the prognostic model. Immune cell infiltration and chemotherapy sensitivity were used to evaluate the prognostic model. RESULTS: MR analysis revealed that MS was causally associated with the incidence risk of BC. Patients in the high-risk group were related to worse survival, immune infiltration, and increased sensitivity to paclitaxel, methotrexate, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, and sunitinib. Furthermore, KLRC1 was expressed at low levels in BC tissues and correlated with poor prognosis and immune cell infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a potential causal association between MS and BC. KLRC1 is a robust and promising biomarker for predicting the prognosis of patients with MS and BC.",background breast cancer bc one preval cancer among women worldwid multipl sclerosi ms play import role pathogenesi also antitumour respons therefor investig causal relationship pathogenesi bc ms via integr mendelian random mr bioinformat analysi method perform mr analys investig potenti causal relationship bc ms via ieu databas comprehens strategi among least absolut shrinkag select oper regress support vector machin univari multivari cox regress analysi time roc regress surviv analysi adopt construct valid prognost model immun cell infiltr chemotherapi sensit use evalu prognost model result mr analysi reveal ms causal associ incid risk bc patient highrisk group relat wors surviv immun infiltr increas sensit paclitaxel methotrex doxorubicin gemcitabin sunitinib furthermor klrc1 express low level bc tissu correl poor prognosi immun cell infiltr conclus find suggest potenti causal associ ms bc klrc1 robust promis biomark predict prognosi patient ms bc
cancer,"INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Areca, a widely used psychoactive substance, has been classified as a Group I carcinogen due to its strong association with oral potentially malignant disorders and oral cancer. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive bibliometric overview of global areca-related research, elucidating its publication trends, intellectual structure, and emerging research frontiers. METHODS: Publications from 1985 to 2024 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. Bibliometric analyses were performed to visualize publication outputs, regional and institutional contributions, journal distributions, co-cited references, and keyword evolution. Temporal and network analyses were conducted to identify major research clusters and developmental trajectories. RESULTS: A total of 2882 articles from 91 regions and 2865 institutions were analysed. Global publications have increased markedly over the past decade. Among the leading contributing regions are India, Taiwan, China, and the Chinese mainland. Co-citation and keyword analyses revealed several major thematic domains: areca toxicity, oral submucous fibrosis, oral cancer, and synergistic effects with tobacco and alcohol. Recent trends indicate a shift from epidemiological and clinical characterization toward mechanistic and translational studies, focusing on fibrosis and carcinogenic signalling pathways. CONCLUSION: This study provides the comprehensive landscape of global areca research, outlining its intellectual evolution and emerging frontiers. Integrating multidisciplinary and international collaborations will be critical for advancing mechanistic understanding and guiding evidence-based prevention strategies.

cancer,"OBJECTIVES: Radon is a leading cause of lung cancer and poses an even greater risk for people who smoke. Maps are used to educate the public about radon and promote testing, yet their effectiveness is rarely evaluated. This study investigated the effects of a radon risk map-in collaboration with a provincial health agency-on testing intentions. An exploratory aim was to assess potential mechanisms, applying psychological insights on risk perception, to evaluate how maps function as risk communication tools. STUDY DESIGN: Online experiment conducted in December 2023 with a quota-sampled panel of residents. METHODS: 1716 British Columbia residents completed measures of radon risk perceptions and testing intentions before and after viewing a risk map adapted from the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control. All participants viewed a pre-experiment prompt on the importance of protecting against radon, especially if you smoke/have smoked. Multilevel regression models assessed changes in testing intentions across subgroups. Path analysis tested worry as a mediator, controlling for demographic covariates. RESULTS: Participants in medium-high- or high-radon-risk areas reported significantly higher average radon testing intentions post-experiment (p < 0.001), irrespective of smoking status. A small decrease was observed among non-smokers living in the lowest ecological risk areas (p < 0.001). Changes in worry appeared to mediate the association between participants' radon risk level and testing intentions. CONCLUSION: Results suggest maps can influence perceptions of risk and encourage radon testing in high-risk areas. In low-risk areas, communications emphasizing the severity of lung cancer and its occurrence in non-smokers may enhance public education and promote testing.",object radon lead caus lung cancer pose even greater risk peopl smoke map use educ public radon promot test yet effect rare evalu studi investig effect radon risk mapin collabor provinci health agencyon test intent exploratori aim assess potenti mechan appli psycholog insight risk percept evalu map function risk commun tool studi design onlin experi conduct decemb 2023 quotasampl panel resid method 1716 british columbia resid complet measur radon risk percept test intent view risk map adapt british columbia centr diseas control particip view preexperi prompt import protect radon especi smokehav smoke multilevel regress model assess chang test intent across subgroup path analysi test worri mediat control demograph covari result particip mediumhigh highradonrisk area report significantli higher averag radon test intent postexperi p 0001 irrespect smoke statu small decreas observ among nonsmok live lowest ecolog risk area p 0001 chang worri appear mediat associ particip radon risk level test intent conclus result suggest map influenc percept risk encourag radon test highrisk area lowrisk area commun emphas sever lung cancer occurr nonsmok may enhanc public educ promot test
cancer,"The best surgical timing for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, whether primary debulking surgery or interval debulking surgery, remains debated. Recent data, including the preliminary ones from TRUST trial, necessitates an updated critical evaluation. A systematic search of PubMed identified only randomized controlled trials comparing interval debulking surgery versus primary debulking surgery in patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer. Primary outcomes included overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). A random-effects meta-analysis, meta-regression, cumulative synthesis, and leave-one-out influence analysis were performed. A total of 2303 patients were included. Compared to primary debulking surgery, interval debulking surgery was associated with lower rates of postoperative complications (OR = 0.37; 95 % CI: 0.18-0.79; P = 0.01) and mortality (OR = 0.23; 95 % CI: 0.09-0.57; P = 0.002). Meta-analysis showed higher rates of complete cytoreduction with interval debulking surgery (OR = 3.84; 95 % CI: 2.14-6.91; P < 0.00001) and lower rates of macroscopic residual disease (OR = 0.20; 95 % CI: 0.13-0.30; P < 0.00001). Pooled data revealed no significant difference in OS (HR = 0.95; 95 % CI: 0.87-1.04; P = 0.26) or PFS (HR = 0.94; 95 % CI: 0.85-1.03; P = 0.16). Subgroup analyses by stage and residual disease confirmed similar survival outcomes. The meta-regression results suggested that even in trials with very high complete cytoreduction rates, no clinically meaningful OS benefit was observed for upfront surgery. In conclusion, interval debulking surgery offers comparable survival outcomes to primary debulking, with reduced perioperative morbidity and mortality, supporting its role as a valid surgical alternative.

cancer,"AIM: Identify distinct knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) profiles and teaching preferences among healthcare workers (HCWs) and explore barriers to implementing cancer-related lymphedema (CRL) management services. BACKGROUND: HCWs play a crucial role in the early prevention and management of CRL. However, existing research on their KAP has largely relied on scale-based total score approaches, which overlook individual heterogeneity. Meanwhile, on the practical side, there is a lack of a systematic environment conducive to supporting HCWs in lymphedema services. DESIGN: Cross-sectional design. METHOD: This study surveyed 1130 healthcare workers from 21 Chinese hospitals between December 2024 and January 2025. Latent profile analysis profiled KAP-based subgroups, whose predictive factors and learning method preferences were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models and DCAT. Barriers to service implementation were explored via latent Dirichlet allocation. RESULTS: Three latent class profiles were identified: low-level, medium-level and high-level KAP. Education, experience in CRL management, professional title and department significantly influenced the KAP categories. Preferences for instructional strategies varied across profiles: Groups 1 and 2 favored structured instruction, whereas Group 3 preferred methods enriched with interactive elements. Thematic analysis identified several key barriers to lymphedema service implementation by HCWs, including resource investment, public awareness, medical security coverage, etc. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal heterogeneous KAP profiles and distinct learning method preferences among HCWs. This heterogeneity suggests a potential direction for developing stratified training tailored to specific needs or competency levels. Future optimization of the lymphedema care environment requires multifaceted interventions at the policy, regulatory, staffing and patient levels.",aim identifi distinct knowledg attitud practic kap profil teach prefer among healthcar worker hcw explor barrier implement cancerrel lymphedema crl manag servic background hcw play crucial role earli prevent manag crl howev exist research kap larg reli scalebas total score approach overlook individu heterogen meanwhil practic side lack systemat environ conduc support hcw lymphedema servic design crosssect design method studi survey 1130 healthcar worker 21 chines hospit decemb 2024 januari 2025 latent profil analysi profil kapbas subgroup whose predict factor learn method prefer analyz use gener linear mix model dcat barrier servic implement explor via latent dirichlet alloc result three latent class profil identifi lowlevel mediumlevel highlevel kap educ experi crl manag profession titl depart significantli influenc kap categori prefer instruct strategi vari across profil group 1 2 favor structur instruct wherea group 3 prefer method enrich interact element themat analysi identifi sever key barrier lymphedema servic implement hcw includ resourc invest public awar medic secur coverag etc conclus find reveal heterogen kap profil distinct learn method prefer among hcw heterogen suggest potenti direct develop stratifi train tailor specif need compet level futur optim lymphedema care environ requir multifacet intervent polici regulatori staf patient level
cancer,"AIM: Compare the diagnostic performance of whole-gland prostate-specific antigen density (wgPSAD) to zonal volume-adjusted prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) for predicting prostate cancer in patients who underwent a prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by prostate biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of consecutive patients who underwent prostate MRI followed by systematic biopsy with or without targeted biopsy between January 2019 and December 2020 was performed. Whole-gland (wgPSAD), transition-zone prostate-specific antigen density (tzPSAD), and peripheral-zone prostate-specific antigen density (pzPSAD) were calculated using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels drawn before imaging, and volume estimates were derived from MRI using artificial intelligence (AI) software assistance. Diagnostic performance was assessed using logistic regression and estimating internally validated receiver operating characteristic area under the characteristic (AUC) curves. RESULTS: A total of 551 patients with a median age of 66 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 61-72) were included. The univariable analysis demonstrated superior AUC for wgPSAD (AUC: 0.71 and 0.71) and tzPSAD (AUC: 0.72 and 0.72) compared to pzPSAD (AUC: 0.51 and 0.56) for any cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). The multivariable analysis including age and 5alpha-reductase inhibitor therapy demonstrated a superior AUC of tzPSAD for predicting csPCa (AUC: 0.77 vs 0.75; P=0.02) compared to both wgPSAD and pzPSAD (AUC: 0.77 vs 0.67; P<0.001). Variable importance analysis suggested prescribed 5alpha-reductase inhibitor therapy may be protective against csPCa. CONCLUSION: wgPSAD and tzPSAD are superior to pzPSAD for the detection of csPCa. When accounting for key covariates, tzPSAD may be superior to wgPSAD.",aim compar diagnost perform wholegland prostatespecif antigen densiti wgpsad zonal volumeadjust prostatespecif antigen densiti psad predict prostat cancer patient underw prostat magnet reson imag mri follow prostat biopsi materi method retrospect studi consecut patient underw prostat mri follow systemat biopsi without target biopsi januari 2019 decemb 2020 perform wholegland wgpsad transitionzon prostatespecif antigen densiti tzpsad peripheralzon prostatespecif antigen densiti pzpsad calcul use prostatespecif antigen psa level drawn imag volum estim deriv mri use artifici intellig ai softwar assist diagnost perform assess use logist regress estim intern valid receiv oper characterist area characterist auc curv result total 551 patient median age 66 year interquartil rang iqr 6172 includ univari analysi demonstr superior auc wgpsad auc 071 071 tzpsad auc 072 072 compar pzpsad auc 051 056 cancer clinic signific prostat cancer cspca multivari analysi includ age 5alphareductas inhibitor therapi demonstr superior auc tzpsad predict cspca auc 077 vs 075 p002 compar wgpsad pzpsad auc 077 vs 067 p0001 variabl import analysi suggest prescrib 5alphareductas inhibitor therapi may protect cspca conclus wgpsad tzpsad superior pzpsad detect cspca account key covari tzpsad may superior wgpsad
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies on the association between airborne particulate matter (PM), particularly PM(2.5) and PM(10), and breast cancer have shown inconsistent results, potentially due to variations in particle composition. To address this, we investigated the relationship between breast cancer and exposure to individual PM(2.5) and PM(10) components, as well as their combined effects, in the French E3N-Generation cohort. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study within the cohort (1990-2011), including 5,222 incident breast cancer cases matched to 5,222 controls. Annual mean concentrations (microg/m(3)) of pollutants at residential addresses were estimated using the CHIMERE chemistry-transport model from 1990 to the index date. Exposure assessment included nine PM components: ammonium, sulfate, black carbon, polychlorobiphenyl-153 (PCB153), nitrate, benzo[a]pyrene, cadmium, dioxins, and Saharan dust. We evaluated single-pollutant effects using logistic regressions, and mixture effects using Quantile G-computation (QGC) and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR). RESULTS: Significant positive associations with breast cancer (Odds Ratios and confidence intervals for one SD increase (controls distribution) were found for ammonium (OR = 1.19; 95%CI: 1.05-1.35), sulfate (OR = 1.17; 95%CI: 1.02-1.35), PCB153 (OR = 1.17; 95%CI: 1.08-1.26), nitrate (OR = 1.16; 95%CI: 1.01-1.33), black carbon (OR = 1.12; 95%CI: 1.05-1.20), cadmium (OR = 1.05; 95%CI: 1.00-1.11). QGC showed a positive association with breast cancer for a one-quartile increase in joint exposure (OR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.00-1.50) with cadmium and nitrate as major contributors. BKMR confirmed a significant positive association between the exposure to the mixture and breast cancer. CONCLUSION: The consistency between single-pollutant and mixture analyses supports a role for multiple PM components acting jointly on breast cancer risk.

cancer,"Cuproptosis has been identified as a unique copper-dependent cell death mechanism that may provide new opportunities for improving tumor therapy outcomes. For currently developed cuproptosis inducers, nonspecific copper release and low levels of copper accumulation in tumors restrict their clinical applications. To precisely manage copper ion release in vivo, a stimuli-responsive 'cuproptosis switch' was designed as an intelligent platform with pH-sensitive 'off' and 'on' states, thereby inducing cancer-specific cuproptosis while guaranteeing biosecurity. A bilayer copper nanocapsule containing Cu(2)O and Cu(2-x)Se shells was demonstrated with a switch-like pH-dependent Cu(+) release profile across a transition pH (6.8) based on their distinct degradable properties. To boost cuproptosis-targeted therapy efficacy, the STING activating agonist MSA-2 was encapsulated in the Cu(2)O/Cu(2-x)Se nanocapsule for establishing lasting and effective immune responses. Cuproptosis-sensitization effects induced by US irradiation and MSA-2 release were elucidated, including 1) up-regulating Cu influx transporter (SLC31A1) expression and down-regulating Cu efflux transporter (ATP7A) expression to increase intracellular copper overload; 2) facilitating rapid GSH depletion for cuproptosis sensitization in the cytoplasm; 3) increasing mitochondrion membrane permeability for intracellular released Cu(+) ions entering the mitochondrion. The TME-specific Cu(+) and MSA-2 release combined with US-irradiated, spatiotemporally located ROS amplification induced tumor-specific cuproptosis, initiated immunogenic cell death, and activated cGAS-STING pathway for boosting robust and durable antitumor efficacy. As a result, complete elimination of primary and distant tumors in mice was achieved at low doses without side effects. The US-sensitized cuproptosis switch may provide opportunities for elimination of local residual tumors and abscopal metastatic foci for final tumor eradication.",cuproptosi identifi uniqu copperdepend cell death mechan may provid new opportun improv tumor therapi outcom current develop cuproptosi induc nonspecif copper releas low level copper accumul tumor restrict clinic applic precis manag copper ion releas vivo stimulirespons cuproptosi switch design intellig platform phsensit state therebi induc cancerspecif cuproptosi guarante biosecur bilay copper nanocapsul contain cu2o cu2xs shell demonstr switchlik phdepend cu releas profil across transit ph 68 base distinct degrad properti boost cuproptosistarget therapi efficaci sting activ agonist msa2 encapsul cu2ocu2xs nanocapsul establish last effect immun respons cuproptosissensit effect induc us irradi msa2 releas elucid includ 1 upregul cu influx transport slc31a1 express downregul cu efflux transport atp7a express increas intracellular copper overload 2 facilit rapid gsh deplet cuproptosi sensit cytoplasm 3 increas mitochondrion membran permeabl intracellular releas cu ion enter mitochondrion tmespecif cu msa2 releas combin usirradi spatiotempor locat ro amplif induc tumorspecif cuproptosi initi immunogen cell death activ cgasst pathway boost robust durabl antitumor efficaci result complet elimin primari distant tumor mice achiev low dose without side effect ussensit cuproptosi switch may provid opportun elimin local residu tumor abscop metastat foci final tumor erad
cancer,"The development of multidrug resistance (MDR) to anticancer agents following chronic treatment remains a significant obstacle in cancer chemotherapy. Overexpression of the energy-dependent drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) has been identified as a major contributor to MDR. Inspired by naturally occurring MDR-reversing cyclic peptides, a series of readily accessible valine thiazole-containing derivatives were designed and synthesized as effective reversal agents against P-gp-mediated MDR based on a hybridization strategy. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis demonstrated that linear valine thiazole derivatives possess greater MDR reversal activity than their macrocyclic analogs. Compound 17e displayed promising synergistic activity by significantly enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel (PTX) against KBV cells (IC(50) = 2.8 nM, reversal fold = 288.5) without inducing obvious toxicity. 17e exhibited approximately 8-fold greater potency than verapamil (VRP), 2-fold greater potency than the third-generation P-gp inhibitor tariquidar (TAR) in KBV cells. Mechanistic studies confirmed that 17e inhibits the efflux function of P-gp in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting its expression, thereby increasing intracellular chemotherapeutic drug accumulation and causing G(2)/M phase arrests, which is associated with increased apoptosis. Taken together, the linear valine thiazole derivative 17e represents a promising starting scaffold for developing novel P-gp inhibitors against MDR.",develop multidrug resist mdr anticanc agent follow chronic treatment remain signific obstacl cancer chemotherapi overexpress energydepend drug efflux transport pglycoprotein pgp identifi major contributor mdr inspir natur occur mdrrevers cyclic peptid seri readili access valin thiazolecontain deriv design synthes effect revers agent pgpmediat mdr base hybrid strategi structureact relationship sar analysi demonstr linear valin thiazol deriv possess greater mdr revers activ macrocycl analog compound 17e display promis synergist activ significantli enhanc therapeut efficaci paclitaxel ptx kbv cell ic50 28 nm revers fold 2885 without induc obviou toxic 17e exhibit approxim 8fold greater potenc verapamil vrp 2fold greater potenc thirdgener pgp inhibitor tariquidar tar kbv cell mechanist studi confirm 17e inhibit efflux function pgp concentrationdepend manner without affect express therebi increas intracellular chemotherapeut drug accumul caus g2m phase arrest associ increas apoptosi taken togeth linear valin thiazol deriv 17e repres promis start scaffold develop novel pgp inhibitor mdr
cancer,"We report a rare case of thyroid cancer with tumor embolism of the internal jugular vein (IJV) that progressed cranially into the skull base and caused multiple cranial neuropathies. An 80-year-old woman presented with a progressively enlarging right cervical mass, which had been neglected for 10 years. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a cystic cervical lesion with a tumor embolism within the IJV extending to the jugular foramen and hypoglossal and facial canals. Fine-needle aspiration cytology yielded inconclusive results on two occasions, likely because of cystic degeneration. The patient developed facial paralysis, tongue deviation, and vocal cord paralysis. Biopsy confirmed papillary thyroid carcinoma with poorly differentiated areas. The patient elected the best supportive care and passed away four months after diagnosis. Cranial progression was likely facilitated by venous stasis due to an intraluminal tumor thrombus combined with the biological aggressiveness of dedifferentiation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of thyroid cancer with retrograde IJV tumor embolism that led to skull base invasion and jugular foramen syndrome. This case highlights the variability in thyroid cancer extension patterns, which can occasionally result in highly atypical and clinically significant manifestations.",report rare case thyroid cancer tumor embol intern jugular vein ijv progress cranial skull base caus multipl cranial neuropathi 80yearold woman present progress enlarg right cervic mass neglect 10 year ultrasonographi magnet reson imag reveal cystic cervic lesion tumor embol within ijv extend jugular foramen hypogloss facial canal fineneedl aspir cytolog yield inconclus result two occas like cystic degener patient develop facial paralysi tongu deviat vocal cord paralysi biopsi confirm papillari thyroid carcinoma poorli differenti area patient elect best support care pass away four month diagnosi cranial progress like facilit venou stasi due intralumin tumor thrombu combin biolog aggress dedifferenti best knowledg first document case thyroid cancer retrograd ijv tumor embol led skull base invas jugular foramen syndrom case highlight variabl thyroid cancer extens pattern occasion result highli atyp clinic signific manifest
cancer,"BACKGROUND: SAM-pointed domain-containing ETS transcription factor (SPDEF), an ETS family transcription factor (TF), functions as a tumor-promoting factor in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the precise mechanisms of SPDEF in regulating NSCLC pathogenesis remain to be fully characterized. METHODS: Bioinformatics analyses were used to identify disease-associated TFs and downstream targets. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to predict hub TFs. The relationship between SPDEF and BIRC5 was validated by luciferase and ChIP assays. The influences on cell phenotypes were evaluated by testing cell colony formation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis. Xenograft studies were used to explore the role in tumor growth. RESULTS: This study revealed 101 disease-associated TFs in NSCLC. GO enrichment analysis of these TFs demonstrated significant enrichment in biological processes including lung development, lung differentiation, and Wnt signaling pathway. PPI analysis revealed FOXA1, GATA6, TBX2, and SPDEF as core regulatory factors. SPDEF and BIRC5 levels were upregulated in NSCLC tumors and cell lines. Mechanistically, SPDEF induced BIRC5 upregulation through transcriptional regulation. SPDEF depletion impaired NSCLC cell invasion, migration, and clonogenicity while inducing apoptosis in vitro, which could be abolished by BIRC5 reconstitution. Moreover, SPDEF deficiency inhibited A549 tumor growth in subcutaneous xenograft models. Additionally, BIRC5 activated the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in NSCLC cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the tumor-promoting function of SPDEF in NSCLC by transcriptionally activating BIRC5, highlighting SPDEF as a candidate target for future NSCLC-directed therapies.",background sampoint domaincontain et transcript factor spdef et famili transcript factor tf function tumorpromot factor nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc howev precis mechan spdef regul nsclc pathogenesi remain fulli character method bioinformat analys use identifi diseaseassoci tf downstream target proteinprotein interact ppi network construct predict hub tf relationship spdef birc5 valid luciferas chip assay influenc cell phenotyp evalu test cell coloni format invas migrat apoptosi xenograft studi use explor role tumor growth result studi reveal 101 diseaseassoci tf nsclc go enrich analysi tf demonstr signific enrich biolog process includ lung develop lung differenti wnt signal pathway ppi analysi reveal foxa1 gata6 tbx2 spdef core regulatori factor spdef birc5 level upregul nsclc tumor cell line mechanist spdef induc birc5 upregul transcript regul spdef deplet impair nsclc cell invas migrat clonogen induc apoptosi vitro could abolish birc5 reconstitut moreov spdef defici inhibit a549 tumor growth subcutan xenograft model addit birc5 activ wntbetacatenin pathway nsclc cell conclus find demonstr tumorpromot function spdef nsclc transcript activ birc5 highlight spdef candid target futur nsclcdirect therapi
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Compression of morbidity may be linked to belonging to particular social strata defined by intersections of age, gender, migration and occupation. Extending the approach by Crimmins and Beltran-Sanchez, we investigated compression of morbidity, defined as reduced socially stratified prevalence of self-reported heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes and functional limitations, using two samples 15 years apart. METHODS: We used data of eleven European countries from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), comparing 2004 (N = 29,224) and 2019/2020 (N = 46,498) samples, to apply multilevel logistic regressions within an intersectional MAIHDA (Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy) framework. FINDINGS: Overall patterns did not show compression of morbidity in terms of lower prevalence after 15 years, but intersectional analyses revealed specific compression patterns. Certain strata showed reduced heart disease prevalence, with older men with migration background experiencing the strongest declines from initially high levels. However, no social stratum showed morbidity compression for stroke. Blue-collar low-skill men exhibited particularly increased cancer prevalence across waves. Among older men, diabetes prevalence increased substantially. Reductions in functional limitation prevalence emerged across waves for all female groups aged 70-79, and for blue-collar high-skill men. INTERPRETATION: Overall, we found that compression of morbidity was largely intersectionally stratified, evidencing the impact of social inequalities in healthy life expectancy. This calls for stratified preventive measures at public health level in the future.

cancer,"IMPORTANCE: Decisions regarding endometrial cancer (EC) adjuvant therapy can be challenging due to the need to balance the benefits of recurrence reduction with treatment toxicity. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has the potential to guide adjuvant therapy decisions by stratifying patients based on their risk of recurrence. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between perioperative ctDNA positivity and survival outcomes in patients with EC. METHODS: An electronic search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Web of Science and included all articles up to July 23rd, 2025. Studies were included if they assessed patients with EC who had ctDNA assessment before and/or after surgery and reported on survival outcomes. Meta-analysis was done to explore the association between ctDNA levels and survival. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the association between ctDNA positivity pre- or post-operatively and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Of 2862 articles reviewed, 11 met inclusion criteria, which led to reporting on 1298 patients. Pre-operative as well as post-operative ctDNA positivity was significantly associated with worse PFS (HR 3.69 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 2.58-5.26], HR 12.61 [95 % CI, 8.78-18.13] respectively), with no significant heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that perioperative detection of ctDNA positivity is significantly associated with worse PFS and could serve as a valuable tool for EC prognostication and guidance for adjuvant therapy decision-making. Prospective studies that evaluate the role of ctDNA in EC are needed for this to be implemented in clinical practice.",import decis regard endometri cancer ec adjuv therapi challeng due need balanc benefit recurr reduct treatment toxic circul tumor dna ctdna potenti guid adjuv therapi decis stratifi patient base risk recurr object determin associ periop ctdna posit surviv outcom patient ec method electron search perform medlin embas cochran central cochran databas systemat review web scienc includ articl juli 23rd 2025 studi includ assess patient ec ctdna assess andor surgeri report surviv outcom metaanalysi done explor associ ctdna level surviv main outcom measur primari outcom associ ctdna posit pre postop progressionfre surviv pf result 2862 articl review 11 met inclus criteria led report 1298 patient preoper well postop ctdna posit significantli associ wors pf hr 369 95 confid interv ci 258526 hr 1261 95 ci 8781813 respect signific heterogen conclus relev systemat review metaanalysi demonstr periop detect ctdna posit significantli associ wors pf could serv valuabl tool ec prognost guidanc adjuv therapi decisionmak prospect studi evalu role ctdna ec need implement clinic practic
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Obesity-induced metabolic stress impairs the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, but the mechanisms linking a high-fat diet (HFD) to immune suppression remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how HFD-induced metabolic changes modulate the tumor immune microenvironment through the STAT3/CD155 axis. METHODS: Murine colorectal cancer models using control, CD155-overexpressing (CD155 OE), and STAT3 knockdown CT26 cells were established under normal or HFD conditions with anti - PD-L1 treatment. Tumor growth, immune infiltration, and gene expression were analyzed by flow cytometry, Western blotting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: HFD impaired anti - PD-L1 efficacy and accelerated tumor growth. Mechanistically, HFD promoted STAT3 nuclear translocation and CD155 upregulation, reducing CD8(+) T cell infiltration and enhancing regulatory T cell accumulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed direct STAT3 binding to the CD155 promoter, while STAT3 knockdown reversed these effects and restored antitumor immunity in HFD-fed mice. CONCLUSION: HFD-induced metabolic stress drives immune evasion via the STAT3/CD155 axis. Targeting this pathway may improve ICB efficacy in obesity-related cancers.",background obesityinduc metabol stress impair efficaci immun checkpoint blockad icb therapi mechan link highfat diet hfd immun suppress remain unclear object investig hfdinduc metabol chang modul tumor immun microenviron stat3cd155 axi method murin colorect cancer model use control cd155overexpress cd155 oe stat3 knockdown ct26 cell establish normal hfd condit anti pdl1 treatment tumor growth immun infiltr gene express analyz flow cytometri western blot chromatin immunoprecipit result hfd impair anti pdl1 efficaci acceler tumor growth mechanist hfd promot stat3 nuclear transloc cd155 upregul reduc cd8 cell infiltr enhanc regulatori cell accumul chromatin immunoprecipit confirm direct stat3 bind cd155 promot stat3 knockdown revers effect restor antitumor immun hfdfed mice conclus hfdinduc metabol stress drive immun evas via stat3cd155 axi target pathway may improv icb efficaci obesityrel cancer
cancer,"Melanoma is a highly aggressive and heterogeneous form of skin cancer with limited effective treatment options. Although substantial progress has been made in immunotherapy, chemotherapy still serves as an essential alternative therapeutic strategy for many patients. Diphenyl disulfide (DPDS), a small molecule composed of two phenyl groups linked by a disulfide bond, has been reported to exert antioxidant and anticancer activities across several types of malignancies. In this study, we examined the cytotoxic effects of DPDS on melanoma cells and investigated the underlying mechanisms responsible for its antitumor activity. Our results showed that DPDS induces both ferroptosis and apoptosis in melanoma cells in a time-dependent manner. At 24 h, DPDS promoted lipid peroxidation, enhanced xCT ubiquitination, and reduced GPX4 expression, all of which are characteristic hallmarks of ferroptosis. Whereas at 48 h, apoptosis occurred, likely because of NRF2 phosphorylation inhibition, which initially protected against cell death. Additionally, DPDS inhibited the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, leading to decreased mTOR expression and increased autophagy levels. Furthermore, the inhibition of ferroptosis or autophagy partially restored cell viability, suggesting a complex interplay between these pathways in DPDS-induced cytotoxicity. These findings highlight that DPDS may be a potential therapeutic agent for melanoma that functions by leveraging dual programmed cell death mechanisms and targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.",melanoma highli aggress heterogen form skin cancer limit effect treatment option although substanti progress made immunotherapi chemotherapi still serv essenti altern therapeut strategi mani patient diphenyl disulfid dpd small molecul compos two phenyl group link disulfid bond report exert antioxid anticanc activ across sever type malign studi examin cytotox effect dpd melanoma cell investig underli mechan respons antitumor activ result show dpd induc ferroptosi apoptosi melanoma cell timedepend manner 24 h dpd promot lipid peroxid enhanc xct ubiquitin reduc gpx4 express characterist hallmark ferroptosi wherea 48 h apoptosi occur like nrf2 phosphoryl inhibit initi protect cell death addit dpd inhibit pi3kaktmtor pathway lead decreas mtor express increas autophagi level furthermor inhibit ferroptosi autophagi partial restor cell viabil suggest complex interplay pathway dpdsinduc cytotox find highlight dpd may potenti therapeut agent melanoma function leverag dual program cell death mechan target pi3kaktmtor signal pathway

cancer,"Dendrobium officinale polysaccharides (DOP) exhibit anticancer potential against colorectal cancer (CRC), yet their mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated DOP's effects on HCT-116 cells. DOP dose- and time-dependently inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis, evidenced by elevated cleaved caspase-3/-9, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), Bax, and reduced Bcl-2. Concurrently, DOP activated autophagy (increased LC3-II/I, Beclin-1; decreased p62) via phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) suppression. Combining DOP with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine enhanced apoptosis (higher cleaved PARP, Bax; lower Bcl-2) and reactivated PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. These findings demonstrate DOP inhibits CRC by dual induction of apoptosis and autophagy blockade through PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibition, with autophagy suppression synergistically augmenting apoptosis.

cancer,"Oral cancer remains a major public health concern, especially in Southeast Asia. Conventional treatments such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy are limited by severe side effects and drug resistance. Natural products offer a safer, multitargeted approach to cancer therapy. Curcuma caesia, a medicinal plant used in traditional medicine, was investigated for its anticancer potential. Using bioactivity-guided isolation, 14 fractions of its hexane extract were screened against CAL 27 oral cancer cells. Two fractions, NPSU HC and NPSU HJ, showed potent cytotoxicity with IC(50) values of 40.78 and 45.60 microg/mL, respectively, and inhibited cell migration and colony formation. NPSU HC induced S- and G2-phase arrest, whereas NPSU HJ increased S-phase cell accumulation. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified 14 phytochemicals, which was followed by the isolation of four sesquiterpenoids, furanodienone, zederone, germacrone, and curcumenol. Among them, furanodienone displayed the most potent activity with IC(50) of 85.41 microM on CAL 27 cell line, causing G2-phase arrest and suppressing cancer cell proliferation. Molecular docking showed strong binding affinities, particularly for furanodienone, toward key oral cancer targets such as CDK6, HRAS, PIK3CA, and MYH9. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations further confirmed the stable interaction between furanodienone and CDK6, supporting its potential as a promising oral cancer therapeutic candidate.",oral cancer remain major public health concern especi southeast asia convent treatment chemotherapi immunotherapi limit sever side effect drug resist natur product offer safer multitarget approach cancer therapi curcuma caesia medicin plant use tradit medicin investig anticanc potenti use bioactivityguid isol 14 fraction hexan extract screen cal 27 oral cancer cell two fraction npsu hc npsu hj show potent cytotox ic50 valu 4078 4560 microgml respect inhibit cell migrat coloni format npsu hc induc g2phase arrest wherea npsu hj increas sphase cell accumul ga chromatographymass spectrometri gcm analysi identifi 14 phytochem follow isol four sesquiterpenoid furanodienon zederon germacron curcumenol among furanodienon display potent activ ic50 8541 microm cal 27 cell line caus g2phase arrest suppress cancer cell prolifer molecular dock show strong bind affin particularli furanodienon toward key oral cancer target cdk6 hra pik3ca myh9 molecular dynam md simul confirm stabl interact furanodienon cdk6 support potenti promis oral cancer therapeut candid

This study investigates endoscopic and histological findings over a 15-year period in patients with first-degree relatives of gastric cancer intestinal type who underwent follow-up upper gastrointestinal endoscopies. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: we conducted a retrospective real-world observational study involving patients who underwent at least two upper gastrointestinal endoscopies between 2008 and 2023 at Sant'Andrea Hospital, Rome. The study analyzed histological findings, dividing participants into four subgroups based on their baseline conditions [H. pylori infection, gastric atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia]. RESULTS: 106 patients were included, only 13% were indicated for follow-up endoscopy according to the MAPS guidelines. An additional 13% of patients developed precancerous conditions, most of whom were H. pylori positive at the index examination, with an odds ratio risk of 6.778 (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: performing routinely virtual chromoendoscopy during the index endoscopy in these patients could improve the detection of precancerous conditions.

cancer,"The role of platelets in blood coagulation and vascular repair is well known. In recent years, extensive attention has been given to the fact that the impact of tumors on peripheral blood platelets plays a key role in cancer progression. This review systematically summarizes the latest research progress on how tumors regulate the quantity, volume, composition, and activation status of peripheral blood platelets through multiple mechanisms. First, tumor cells can induce excessive platelet production by activating AhR-RUNX1 signaling through paracrine pathways and the release of kynurenine, thereby leading to thrombocytosis, which is associated with advanced tumor stages, metastasis, and poor prognosis. Second, tumor progression may trigger disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or chemotherapy-related bone marrow suppression, which in turn results in consumptive thrombocytopenia. In addition, dynamic changes in the mean platelet volume (MPV) are related to tumor type and progression stage, which may reflect abnormal megakaryocyte differentiation or inflammatory status. In terms of platelet composition, tumor cells can remodel the proteome and transcriptome of platelets by secreting ADP, IgG, and functional RNA. Changes in RNA profiles have been confirmed to have potential for tumor diagnosis. In terms of activation status, tumor cells can induce platelet activation and aggregation (TCIPA) by releasing procoagulant factors such as tissue factors and exosomes (EVs), accelerating thrombosis and promoting angiogenesis. In clinical applications, platelet-related biomarkers have become a research hotspot for early cancer diagnosis and prognostic evaluation. Moreover, targeting platelets affected by tumors provides new strategies for tumor treatment. On the basis of the scientific findings of numerous existing studies, it is speculated that there seems to be a ""dynamic balance"" among platelets, which also provides a new direction for future research.",role platelet blood coagul vascular repair well known recent year extens attent given fact impact tumor peripher blood platelet play key role cancer progress review systemat summar latest research progress tumor regul quantiti volum composit activ statu peripher blood platelet multipl mechan first tumor cell induc excess platelet product activ ahrrunx1 signal paracrin pathway releas kynurenin therebi lead thrombocytosi associ advanc tumor stage metastasi poor prognosi second tumor progress may trigger dissemin intravascular coagul dic chemotherapyrel bone marrow suppress turn result consumpt thrombocytopenia addit dynam chang mean platelet volum mpv relat tumor type progress stage may reflect abnorm megakaryocyt differenti inflammatori statu term platelet composit tumor cell remodel proteom transcriptom platelet secret adp igg function rna chang rna profil confirm potenti tumor diagnosi term activ statu tumor cell induc platelet activ aggreg tcipa releas procoagul factor tissu factor exosom ev acceler thrombosi promot angiogenesi clinic applic plateletrel biomark becom research hotspot earli cancer diagnosi prognost evalu moreov target platelet affect tumor provid new strategi tumor treatment basi scientif find numer exist studi specul seem dynam balanc among platelet also provid new direct futur research
cancer,"PURPOSE: With increasing reliance on large language models (LLMs) for health information, this study evaluated reliability and quality, understandability, actionability, readability and misinformation risk of responses from LLMs to oral health concerns and oral side effects in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. METHODS: Frequently asked questions on oral health and HNC therapy side effects were identified via ChatGPT-GPT-4-turbo and Gemini-2.5 Flash, then submitted to eight LLMs (ChatGPT-GPT-4-turbo, Gemini-2.5 Flash, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, Chatsonic, Mistral, Meta AI-Llama 4, DeepSeek-R1). Responses were assessed using DISCERN and modified DISCERN instruments (reliability and quality), Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT [understandability and actionability]), Flesch-Reading-Ease-Score (FRES [readability]), misinformation score, citations, and wordcounts. Statistical analysis was done by Scheirer-Ray-Hare-test followed by Dunn's post-hoc-tests and Bonferroni-Holm correction (p < 0.05). RESULTS: A total of 40 questions belonging to 12 oral health-related categories were identified. Statistically significant differences between LLMs were found for DISCERN, modified DISCERN, PEMAT-understandability, PEMAT-actionability, FRES, and word counts (p < 0.001). Median DISCERN and modified DISCERN scores amounted from 47.0 (ChatGPT-GPT-4-turbo) to 59.0 (Perplexity, Chatsonic) and from 2.0 (Gemini-2.5 Flash, Mistral) to 5.0 (Perplexity) indicating good to fair reliability. LLMs were understandable (median PEMAT-understandability scores >/= 75.0), but provided limited specific guidance (median PEMAT-actionability scores </= 40) and used complex language (median FRES </= 40.2). Misinformation risk was generally low and not statistically significant among LLMs (p = 0.768). CONCLUSION: Despite a low overall misinformation risk, deficits in actionability highlight the need for cautious integration of LLMs into HNC patient education.",purpos increas relianc larg languag model llm health inform studi evalu reliabl qualiti understand action readabl misinform risk respons llm oral health concern oral side effect head neck cancer hnc patient method frequent ask question oral health hnc therapi side effect identifi via chatgptgpt4turbo gemini25 flash submit eight llm chatgptgpt4turbo gemini25 flash microsoft copilot perplex chatson mistral meta aillama 4 deepseekr1 respons assess use discern modifi discern instrument reliabl qualiti patient educ materi assess tool pemat understand action fleschreadingeasescor fre readabl misinform score citat wordcount statist analysi done scheirerrayharetest follow dunn posthoctest bonferroniholm correct p 005 result total 40 question belong 12 oral healthrel categori identifi statist signific differ llm found discern modifi discern pematunderstand pemataction fre word count p 0001 median discern modifi discern score amount 470 chatgptgpt4turbo 590 perplex chatson 20 gemini25 flash mistral 50 perplex indic good fair reliabl llm understand median pematunderstand score 750 provid limit specif guidanc median pemataction score 40 use complex languag median fre 402 misinform risk gener low statist signific among llm p 0768 conclus despit low overal misinform risk deficit action highlight need cautiou integr llm hnc patient educ

cancer,"Isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) is a critical technique for the quantification of protein biomarkers in complex biological samples, enabling sensitive measurement through integration with sample preparation to eliminate matrix interference. Nevertheless, the interchangeability between distinct pretreatment strategies is poorly defined. Herein, two traceable IDMS methods, immune mass spectrometry (IMS) and direct mass spectrometry (DMS), that combine immunoaffinity or antibody-free pretreatment were established for the quantification of plasma ProGRP, which is a recognized biomarker for small cell lung cancer. The internal standard curve was established using NLLGLIEAK, an enzymatic hydrolysis peptide of ProGRP, and its isotope-labeled molecule to ensure quantitative traceability. A microliter high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry platform was established for sensitive quantification of ProGRP in the range of 0.398-13.8 ng/mL. Correction factors were introduced to eliminate the effects of protein loss and enzyme digestion efficiency on the quantitative results, which were 86.84% for IMS and 85.48% for DMS. The RSDs of IMS and DMS were 5.5% and 4.3%, respectively. The comparability among the established MS methods and two immune methods was studied using plasma from patients with abnormally high expression of ProGRP. The IMS and DMS results showed good consistency and good correlation with the results of clinical chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA), while the correlation between CLIA and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results was poor. The factors affecting quantification accuracy by MS analysis and immunoassay were discussed, revealing the potential of IMS and DMS as reference measurement procedures for protein biomarkers in complex matrices.",isotop dilut mass spectrometri idm critic techniqu quantif protein biomark complex biolog sampl enabl sensit measur integr sampl prepar elimin matrix interfer nevertheless interchang distinct pretreat strategi poorli defin herein two traceabl idm method immun mass spectrometri im direct mass spectrometri dm combin immunoaffin antibodyfre pretreat establish quantif plasma progrp recogn biomark small cell lung cancer intern standard curv establish use nllglieak enzymat hydrolysi peptid progrp isotopelabel molecul ensur quantit traceabl microlit highperform liquid chromatographi tandem mass spectrometri platform establish sensit quantif progrp rang 0398138 ngml correct factor introduc elimin effect protein loss enzym digest effici quantit result 8684 im 8548 dm rsd im dm 55 43 respect compar among establish ms method two immun method studi use plasma patient abnorm high express progrp im dm result show good consist good correl result clinic chemiluminesc immunoassay clia correl clia enzymelink immunosorb assay elisa result poor factor affect quantif accuraci ms analysi immunoassay discuss reveal potenti im dm refer measur procedur protein biomark complex matric
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin D regulates cell growth and differentiation, encourages pro-apoptotic effect, stimulates antiangiogenic effect, and affects both innate and adaptive immunity. However, serum vitamin D level could differ between countries according to geographic, genetic, and dietary factors. AIM OF THE WORK: Cosidering that most studies of relations between vitamin D level and breast cancer were conducted outside Africa and considering the fact that populations differ in sun exposure, dietary habits, and genetic construction, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between serum levels of vitamin D3 and vitamin D- binding protein (VDBP) with pathological response, clinicopathological characteristics, and various biological markers in Egyptian breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). METHODS: A total of 71 female breast cancer patients (mean age: 57 years) were enrolled in this prospective observational study. Fasting blood samples were collected 1 day before and 3 months after initiation of NACT. Serum levels of vitamin D3 and V DBP were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Tumor expression of Ki-67, HER2, progesterone receptor (PR), and estrogen receptor (ER) was assessed via immunohistochemistry. Serum levels of CA 15-3 and Bcl-2 were also measured. RESULTS: Complete pathological response (pCR) was achieved in 44 patients (68.7%). A statistically significant increase in both vitamin D3 and VDBP levels was observed following NACT (p < 0.001). Lower pre- and post-treatment levels of vitamin D3 and VDBP were significantly associated with postmenopausal status, higher tumor grade and stage, triple-negative breast cancer subtype, and high Ki-67 expression (p < 0.001). Conversely, higher levels were significantly associated with achieving pCR (p < 0.001). Both vitamin D3 and VDBP levels demonstrated a significant negative correlation with tumor stage and grade (p < 0.001). Among different clinical and laboratory parameters, only triple-negative subtype and baseline vitamin D were significantly predictive for pCR by multivariable analysis (OR 1.488 and 0.506, respectively) and (95% CI 1.109-1.825 and 0.331-0.75, respectively). CONCLUSION: Serum levels of vitamin D3 and VDBP significantly increased after NACT and were associated with favorable clinicopathological features and pCR. Only triple-negative subtype and baseline vitamin D were significantly predictive for pCR by multivariable analysis. These findings suggest that vitamin D3 and VDBP may serve as potential prognostic indicators in breast cancer management.",background vitamin regul cell growth differenti encourag proapoptot effect stimul antiangiogen effect affect innat adapt immun howev serum vitamin level could differ countri accord geograph genet dietari factor aim work cosid studi relat vitamin level breast cancer conduct outsid africa consid fact popul differ sun exposur dietari habit genet construct studi aim investig relationship serum level vitamin d3 vitamin bind protein vdbp patholog respons clinicopatholog characterist variou biolog marker egyptian breast cancer patient undergo neoadjuv chemotherapi nact method total 71 femal breast cancer patient mean age 57 year enrol prospect observ studi fast blood sampl collect 1 day 3 month initi nact serum level vitamin d3 v dbp quantifi use highperform liquid chromatographi hplc enzymelink immunosorb assay elisa respect tumor express ki67 her2 progesteron receptor pr estrogen receptor er assess via immunohistochemistri serum level ca 153 bcl2 also measur result complet patholog respons pcr achiev 44 patient 687 statist signific increas vitamin d3 vdbp level observ follow nact p 0001 lower pre posttreat level vitamin d3 vdbp significantli associ postmenopaus statu higher tumor grade stage tripleneg breast cancer subtyp high ki67 express p 0001 convers higher level significantli associ achiev pcr p 0001 vitamin d3 vdbp level demonstr signific neg correl tumor stage grade p 0001 among differ clinic laboratori paramet tripleneg subtyp baselin vitamin significantli predict pcr multivari analysi 1488 0506 respect 95 ci 11091825 0331075 respect conclus serum level vitamin d3 vdbp significantli increas nact associ favor clinicopatholog featur pcr tripleneg subtyp baselin vitamin significantli predict pcr multivari analysi find suggest vitamin d3 vdbp may serv potenti prognost indic breast cancer manag
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) is the main cause for cancer-related mortality in the world. Recent studies have confirmed that metabolic reprogramming plays a significant role in cancer progression. This study aims to further clarify the underlying mechanisms that the tumor suppressor miR-1343-3p exerts anti-gastric cancer effects via glucose metabolic reprogramming pathways. METHODS: High-throughput sequencing combined with bioinformatics analysis predicted significantly differentially expressed miRNAs and target mRNAs after salidroside treatment. RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) was used to verify miRNA interaction with its downstream target protein, while co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) was applied to confirm downstream target proteins interaction. The IC(50) of salidroside was determined by in vitro CCK-8 assay and colony formation experiment. qRT-PCR, Western blot, ELISA, and ATP detection were used to evaluate cancer cell proliferation, miRNA-mRNA expression and metabolite changes. Cancer cells were transfection with miR-1343-3p mimics or inhibitors, OGDHL-targeted siRNA (si-OGDHL), to verify the effects of salidroside against cancers. In vivo tumor-bearing nude mouse models after salidroside or miR-1343-3p agomir treatments were applied to analyze the targeted miRNA-mRNA molecules expression and metabolite changes. RESULTS: Bioinformatics confirmed that tumor suppressor miR-1343-3p down-regulated OGDHL expression, a key alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex subunit of TCA cycle. Our findings first verified that OGDHL interacted with PDHB, a key pyruvate dehydrogenase E1-beta subunit in gastric cancer. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that salidroside inhibited GC growth in a time and dose-dependent way through up-regulating tumor suppressor miR-1343-3p, down-regulating OGDHL expression, destabilizing PDHB protein homeostasis, reducing pyruvate oxidative decarboxylation, and decreasing acetyl-CoA and ATP production. CONCLUSION: Tumor suppressor miR-1343-3p inhibited gastric cancer cell proliferation by regulating OGDHL/PDHB-pyruvate glucose metabolism axis, which lay a better basis for targeted therapeutic strategy in cancers.",background gastric cancer gc main caus cancerrel mortal world recent studi confirm metabol reprogram play signific role cancer progress studi aim clarifi underli mechan tumor suppressor mir13433p exert antigastr cancer effect via glucos metabol reprogram pathway method highthroughput sequenc combin bioinformat analysi predict significantli differenti express mirna target mrna salidrosid treatment rnabind protein immunoprecipit rip use verifi mirna interact downstream target protein coimmunoprecipit coip appli confirm downstream target protein interact ic50 salidrosid determin vitro cck8 assay coloni format experi qrtpcr western blot elisa atp detect use evalu cancer cell prolifer mirnamrna express metabolit chang cancer cell transfect mir13433p mimic inhibitor ogdhltarget sirna siogdhl verifi effect salidrosid cancer vivo tumorbear nude mous model salidrosid mir13433p agomir treatment appli analyz target mirnamrna molecul express metabolit chang result bioinformat confirm tumor suppressor mir13433p downregul ogdhl express key alphaketoglutar dehydrogenas complex subunit tca cycl find first verifi ogdhl interact pdhb key pyruv dehydrogenas e1beta subunit gastric cancer vitro vivo experi reveal salidrosid inhibit gc growth time dosedepend way upregul tumor suppressor mir13433p downregul ogdhl express destabil pdhb protein homeostasi reduc pyruv oxid decarboxyl decreas acetylcoa atp product conclus tumor suppressor mir13433p inhibit gastric cancer cell prolifer regul ogdhlpdhbpyruv glucos metabol axi lay better basi target therapeut strategi cancer
cancer,"BACKGROUND: The disease burden of alcoholic liver cancer (ALC) has been changing due to socioeconomic development. An up-to-date evaluation of this change can increase public awareness and facilitate health policy development. METHODS: The data were extracted from the Global Burden of Diseases Study (GBD) 2021. Epidemiological changes of morbidity and mortality in different regions, as well as the differences in gender and age were analyzed. Temporal trends were determined using Joinpoint regression analysis and age-period-cohort analysis was employed to evaluate the effects of age, period, and cohort. RESULTS: Globally, there were 99,543.67 new cases (95% UI 80957.40-120401.87) and 92,227.78 deaths (95% UI 75053.11-112,160.27) in 2021, increased by 158.92% and 141.61%, respectively, compared to 1990. Decomposition analysis revealed that population growth was the primary driver of the increased morbidity (41.13%) and mortality (54.87%). The global estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) of morbidity and mortality exhibited an ascending trend, while differences existed across different regions. The morbidity and mortality rates were higher in males than in females across all age groups. Joinpoint regression analysis showed an increased morbidity and mortality rate. The age effect indicated that the highest risk was observed at 75-79 years for morbidity and 80-84 years for mortality. The period effect showed an increasing risk, while improving cohort risks for mortality were identified. CONCLUSION: Alcoholic liver cancer has posed an increasing health burden since 1990, particularly affecting male and the elderly population. Effective prevention policies on specific age groups should be formulated to improve this situation.",background diseas burden alcohol liver cancer alc chang due socioeconom develop uptod evalu chang increas public awar facilit health polici develop method data extract global burden diseas studi gbd 2021 epidemiolog chang morbid mortal differ region well differ gender age analyz tempor trend determin use joinpoint regress analysi ageperiodcohort analysi employ evalu effect age period cohort result global 9954367 new case 95 ui 809574012040187 9222778 death 95 ui 750531111216027 2021 increas 15892 14161 respect compar 1990 decomposit analysi reveal popul growth primari driver increas morbid 4113 mortal 5487 global estim annual percentag chang eapc morbid mortal exhibit ascend trend differ exist across differ region morbid mortal rate higher male femal across age group joinpoint regress analysi show increas morbid mortal rate age effect indic highest risk observ 7579 year morbid 8084 year mortal period effect show increas risk improv cohort risk mortal identifi conclus alcohol liver cancer pose increas health burden sinc 1990 particularli affect male elderli popul effect prevent polici specif age group formul improv situat
cancer,"In this study, graphene oxide (GO) derived from rice husk was functionalized with silver nitrate (AgNO(3)) through a chemical co-precipitation method, and its biomedical applications were systematically investigated. Drug release experiments revealed a pH-responsive profile, where at pH 4.0 the cumulative release reached 32.6 +/- 1.6% after 24 h, compared to 12.4 +/- 1.8% at pH 7.4, highlighting its potential for targeted delivery to cancer cells. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) analysis and flow cytometry demonstrated that RH-GO/AgNO(3) treatment elevated oxidative stress and triggered apoptosis in HeLa cells. Furthermore, 5-fluorouracil (FU) was successfully loaded onto the nanocomposite surface via non-covalent interactions. Cytotoxicity assessment by MTT assay showed that FU-loaded RH-GO/AgNO(3) had the strongest anticancer activity, with an IC(50) value of 256.3 microg/mL. ROS levels in treated HeLacells increased significantly (40.17%) compared to the control group (19.45%), and flow cytometry confirmed a reduction in cell viability (69.5%) accompanied by enhanced apoptosis (early: 8.3%, late: 4.0%) and necrosis (18.2%). Collectively, these findings indicate that RH-GO/AgNO(3)-FU induces cancer cell death predominantly via apoptosis. Overall, this work demonstrates that agricultural waste-derived nanomaterials can serve as cost-effective and sustainable platforms for advanced drug delivery in cancer therapeutics.",studi graphen oxid go deriv rice husk function silver nitrat agno3 chemic coprecipit method biomed applic systemat investig drug releas experi reveal phrespons profil ph 40 cumul releas reach 326 16 24 h compar 124 18 ph 74 highlight potenti target deliveri cancer cell reactiv oxygen speci ro analysi flow cytometri demonstr rhgoagno3 treatment elev oxid stress trigger apoptosi hela cell furthermor 5fluorouracil fu success load onto nanocomposit surfac via noncoval interact cytotox assess mtt assay show fuload rhgoagno3 strongest anticanc activ ic50 valu 2563 microgml ro level treat helacel increas significantli 4017 compar control group 1945 flow cytometri confirm reduct cell viabil 695 accompani enhanc apoptosi earli 83 late 40 necrosi 182 collect find indic rhgoagno3fu induc cancer cell death predominantli via apoptosi overal work demonstr agricultur wastederiv nanomateri serv costeffect sustain platform advanc drug deliveri cancer therapeut
cancer,"PURPOSE: Acoustic analysis is an objective and quantitative method in diagnosing speech disorders and evaluating treatment efficacy. Although many reports have used acoustic analysis for oral cancer patients, few studies have focused on the extent of tongue resection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of acoustic analysis in the assessment of postoperative speech impairment in oral cancer patients. METHODS: Postoperative speech data as well as Speech Handicap Index (SHI) and 5-point speech intelligibility scale were collected from 65 patients including 31 cases of oral cancer resection without glossectomy, 18 cases of partial glossectomy, and 16 cases of subtotal glossectomy. Speech data were acoustically analyzed by triangular vowel space area, vowel articulation index (VAI), first (F1) and second (F2) formant slopes, and compared according to the extent of tongue resection. RESULTS: The frequency of speech impairment assessed by SHI and 5-point speech intelligibility scale was differed according to the extent of tongue resection. As acoustic analysis, VAI and F1 slope in cases of subtotal glossectomy were significantly smaller than those in cases of partial glossectomy. F2 slope in cases of subtotal glossectomy was significantly smaller than those in the other cases. CONCLUSION: Acoustic analysis was potentially useful as an objective speech assessment for the patients who underwent oral cancer surgery.",purpos acoust analysi object quantit method diagnos speech disord evalu treatment efficaci although mani report use acoust analysi oral cancer patient studi focus extent tongu resect aim studi evalu use acoust analysi assess postop speech impair oral cancer patient method postop speech data well speech handicap index shi 5point speech intellig scale collect 65 patient includ 31 case oral cancer resect without glossectomi 18 case partial glossectomi 16 case subtot glossectomi speech data acoust analyz triangular vowel space area vowel articul index vai first f1 second f2 formant slope compar accord extent tongu resect result frequenc speech impair assess shi 5point speech intellig scale differ accord extent tongu resect acoust analysi vai f1 slope case subtot glossectomi significantli smaller case partial glossectomi f2 slope case subtot glossectomi significantli smaller case conclus acoust analysi potenti use object speech assess patient underw oral cancer surgeri
cancer,"PURPOSE: Chemotherapy-induced constipation frequently occurs with cisplatin-containing treatments, partly because of concomitant neurokinin 1 and serotonin 3 receptor antagonists. We have clinically observed that patients with baseline regular laxative administration, most of whom were on magnesium oxide, exhibited less chemotherapy-induced constipation than those without, and assessed its impact on symptom development in real-world cisplatin-containing treatment. METHODS: Patients with lung cancer receiving cisplatin-containing treatment (n = 240) were divided into a control group without baseline laxative administration and a magnesium group with baseline regular magnesium oxide administration and retrospectively evaluated. The primary endpoint was evaluation of the incidence of grade >/= 2 constipation during the first 7 days following treatment initiation. RESULTS: Incidence of grade >/= 2 constipation was 82.5% in the control group and 50.0% in the magnesium group, which was significantly less in the magnesium group (P < 0.0001). The incidence of all-grade symptoms was also significantly lower in the magnesium group than in the control group (67.5% vs. 84.5%, P = 0.02). Additionally, the administration of new laxatives was less common in the magnesium group (P = 0.007). Multivariable logistic regression analysis suggested that baseline administration of magnesium oxide is a preventive factor for grade >/= 2 constipation. Furthermore, patients receiving 2 g daily magnesium oxide at baseline developed significantly less grade >/= 2 constipation than those with < 2 g (19.1% and 84.2%, respectively, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that patients with baseline regular magnesium oxide administration exhibit less chemotherapy-induced constipation than those without the administration in cisplatin-containing treatments.",purpos chemotherapyinduc constip frequent occur cisplatincontain treatment partli concomit neurokinin 1 serotonin 3 receptor antagonist clinic observ patient baselin regular lax administr magnesium oxid exhibit less chemotherapyinduc constip without assess impact symptom develop realworld cisplatincontain treatment method patient lung cancer receiv cisplatincontain treatment n 240 divid control group without baselin lax administr magnesium group baselin regular magnesium oxid administr retrospect evalu primari endpoint evalu incid grade 2 constip first 7 day follow treatment initi result incid grade 2 constip 825 control group 500 magnesium group significantli less magnesium group p 00001 incid allgrad symptom also significantli lower magnesium group control group 675 vs 845 p 002 addit administr new lax less common magnesium group p 0007 multivari logist regress analysi suggest baselin administr magnesium oxid prevent factor grade 2 constip furthermor patient receiv 2 g daili magnesium oxid baselin develop significantli less grade 2 constip 2 g 191 842 respect p 00001 conclus present studi suggest patient baselin regular magnesium oxid administr exhibit less chemotherapyinduc constip without administr cisplatincontain treatment

METHODS: In this study, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model for bladder cancer diagnosis using CT imaging data from our hospital and The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The model was trained and validated using a large dataset of CT images, and its diagnostic accuracy was assessed through various performance metrics. The AI model was constructed using deep learning techniques, which can automatically learn and extract features from CT images. Retrospective CT data from our hospital and TCIA were used to train the AI model. Performance metrics were evaluated, and the Grad-CAM results were reviewed by radiologists. RESULTS: The test-set accuracy exceeded 0.90, and Grad-CAM correctly highlighted tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The AI model offers accurate and transparent bladder-cancer detection on routine CT scans and merits prospective validation.",object bladder cancer one common malign urinari system earli diagnosi treatment crucial improv patient prognosi method studi develop artifici intellig ai model bladder cancer diagnosi use ct imag data hospit cancer imag archiv tcia model train valid use larg dataset ct imag diagnost accuraci assess variou perform metric ai model construct use deep learn techniqu automat learn extract featur ct imag retrospect ct data hospit tcia use train ai model perform metric evalu gradcam result review radiologist result testset accuraci exceed 090 gradcam correctli highlight tumor conclus ai model offer accur transpar bladdercanc detect routin ct scan merit prospect valid

cancer,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Esophagojejunal (EJ) leakage is a serious complication following total gastrectomy for gastric cancer. While several nutritional and treatment-related risk factors have been described, the role of Candida esophagitis (CE) in anastomotic failure has not been previously investigated. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 268 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent total gastrectomy with EJ anastomosis. The study was conducted between March 2021 and March 2025 at a tertiary referral center. CE was diagnosed by histopathologic examination of proximal esophageal margins submitted during surgery. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine predictors of EJ leakage. Best subsets variable selection using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) guided final model development. RESULTS: Among the 268 patients, 48 (17.9%) developed EJ leakage. Multivariable analysis identified CE (OR: 2.19, p = 0.043), hypoalbuminemia (< 3.5 g/dL) (OR: 3.08, p = 0.007), BMI >/= 25 kg/m(2) (OR: 3.68, p = 0.004), and administration of neoadjuvant therapy (OR: 2.34, p = 0.024) as independent predictors of EJ leakage. Additional analyses of diagnostic timing indicated that CE detected only on permanent histology (delayed treatment) was associated with higher odds of leak (adj OR 3.62; 95%CI: 1.42-9.23; p = 0.007), whereas CE detected on intraoperative frozen section was not. CONCLUSION: CE was associated with increased odds of EJ leakage after adjustment, but causality cannot be inferred from this retrospective study.

cancer,"PURPOSE: To clinically validate fully automated intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) planning for head and neck cancer (HNC) through blinded comparison with manual plans by experienced radiation oncologists (ROs). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty patients with HNC treated with a manually created IMPT plan were retrospectively included. Dose prescription was 7000 cGy (relative biologic effectiveness) to the primary tumor and 5425 cGy (relative biologic effectiveness) to the bilateral elective nodal volumes. Fully automated IMPT plans were generated using Erasmus-iCycle, applying the same clinical 4-beam configuration and dose constraints. Three experienced HNC ROs independently assessed the automated and corresponding manual plans in a blinded manner. Each RO evaluated both plans, blinded to the planning method, to determine clinical acceptability and indicate their preference, if any. Interobserver differences in preference were evaluated using pairwise McNemar tests. A generalized linear mixed model was used to assess overall preference for automated plans. RESULTS: All 30 automated IMPT plans were considered clinically acceptable, whereas 28 of the 30 manual plans were rated clinically acceptable by all 3 ROs. In 28 out of 30 cases, the ROs unanimously (P = 1.00 between each pair of observers) preferred the automated plan. In the remaining 2 cases, 1 of the 3 ROs had no preference. The manual plan was never preferred. The overall preference for automated plans over no preference was statistically significant (P< .001). Target coverage was considered equivalent, whereas target conformality and sparing of both serial and parallel organs at risk were generally rated superior in the automated plans. CONCLUSIONS: All fully automated IMPT plans for HNC were considered clinically acceptable by experienced HNC ROs. Automated plans were unanimously preferred over manually created plans in nearly all cases, with statistical significance, highlighting the clinical potential of automated IMPT planning tools.",purpos clinic valid fulli autom intensitymodul proton therapi impt plan head neck cancer hnc blind comparison manual plan experienc radiat oncologist ro method materi thirti patient hnc treat manual creat impt plan retrospect includ dose prescript 7000 cgi rel biolog effect primari tumor 5425 cgi rel biolog effect bilater elect nodal volum fulli autom impt plan gener use erasmusicycl appli clinic 4beam configur dose constraint three experienc hnc ro independ assess autom correspond manual plan blind manner ro evalu plan blind plan method determin clinic accept indic prefer interobserv differ prefer evalu use pairwis mcnemar test gener linear mix model use assess overal prefer autom plan result 30 autom impt plan consid clinic accept wherea 28 30 manual plan rate clinic accept 3 ro 28 30 case ro unanim p 100 pair observ prefer autom plan remain 2 case 1 3 ro prefer manual plan never prefer overal prefer autom plan prefer statist signific p 001 target coverag consid equival wherea target conform spare serial parallel organ risk gener rate superior autom plan conclus fulli autom impt plan hnc consid clinic accept experienc hnc ro autom plan unanim prefer manual creat plan nearli case statist signific highlight clinic potenti autom impt plan tool
cancer,"CO2 laser resurfacing is a widely used cosmetic procedure for facial rejuvenation, addressing wrinkles, scars, and other skin imperfections. Although complications are rare, post-laser skin lesions have been reported, particularly in patients with a history of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). This report presents a rare case of a 41-year-old female that developed a solitary keratoacanthoma (KA) 3 weeks after CO2 laser resurfacing. A detailed medical history was taken, and an excisional biopsy was performed. Histopathological examination confirmed KA, a rare but documented complication of fractional laser resurfacing. The lesion was excised without recurrence, and healing was uneventful. This case is unique because the patient had no prior NMSC history, making KA an unusual occurrence. Previous studies typically associate KA with known risk factors such as NMSC or immunosuppression. This report highlights the importance of post-laser surveillance, even in patients without recognized risk factors. It contributes to the understanding of potential complications of CO2 laser resurfacing, emphasizing the need for clinical awareness.",co2 laser resurfac wide use cosmet procedur facial rejuven address wrinkl scar skin imperfect although complic rare postlas skin lesion report particularli patient histori nonmelanoma skin cancer nmsc report present rare case 41yearold femal develop solitari keratoacanthoma ka 3 week co2 laser resurfac detail medic histori taken excision biopsi perform histopatholog examin confirm ka rare document complic fraction laser resurfac lesion excis without recurr heal unev case uniqu patient prior nmsc histori make ka unusu occurr previou studi typic associ ka known risk factor nmsc immunosuppress report highlight import postlas surveil even patient without recogn risk factor contribut understand potenti complic co2 laser resurfac emphas need clinic awar
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory disease that affects the skin and skeletal muscles, with variants including clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis and malignancy-associated dermatomyositis. METHODS: This research analyzes the characteristics of dermatomyositis in women. A retrospective cross-sectional study evaluated clinical presentation, muscle involvement, immunological markers, association with malignancy, complications, and mortality in females during a 15-year follow-up at a tertiary dermatology center. RESULTS: Thirty women (mean age 63.6 +/- 11.6 years) were analyzed. The most common skin manifestations were the V-sign (73.3%), followed by a heliotrope rash and Gottron's papules (70.0% each). Periungual erythema appeared in 50.0%, and the shawl sign in 46.7%. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis linked the V-sign with age >/= 62.5 years (area under the curve = 0.75) and periungual erythema with age </= 68.5 (area under the curve = 0.76). Muscle weakness was present in 63.3% of cases. Myositis-associated autoantibodies and myositis-specific autoantibodies were positive in 53.3%. Seven patients (23.3%) had malignancy-associated dermatomyositis, including ovarian, breast, endometrial, lung, gastric, and nasopharyngeal cancers. CONCLUSIONS: The V-sign, a heliotrope rash, and Gottron's papules were the most common skin findings. Muscle involvement affected nearly two-thirds of patients.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no report of trinuclear Pt(II)-NHC complexes showcasing cytotoxicity toward cancer cells. Herein, we introduce the synthesis and characterization of the first examples of trinuclear platinum(II) complexes possessing a tris-NHC ligand, along with the corresponding mononuclear complexes. The in vitro cytotoxicity assessment of these complexes is explored against three breast cancer cell lines, 4T1, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7, and a liver cancer cell line, Hep G2, and the results are compared with values obtained for the standard platinum drug cisplatin.",platinumii complex nheterocycl carben nhc ligand demonstr intrigu promis foundat construct novel metalbas anticanc drug best knowledg report trinuclear ptiinhc complex showcas cytotox toward cancer cell herein introduc synthesi character first exampl trinuclear platinumii complex possess trisnhc ligand along correspond mononuclear complex vitro cytotox assess complex explor three breast cancer cell line 4t1 mdamb231 mcf7 liver cancer cell line hep g2 result compar valu obtain standard platinum drug cisplatin
cancer,"Tobacco is a major cause of chronic diseases such as lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease worldwide. Nicotine, the primary psychoactive component in tobacco, is highly addictive and while not the primary driver of such tobacco-related diseases, poses various health risks, particularly those affecting the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. Although nicotine-based therapies, such as nicotine replacement products, are widely utilized in smoking cessation efforts today, the impact of newer, tobacco delivery systems such as electronic nicotine delivery systems, or ENDS, remains uncertain and warrants continued evaluation. This study aims to develop and validate a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulation model for nicotine using clinical pharmacokinetic data. The PBPK simulation model for nicotine was developed by incorporating drug-specific and system-specific parameters and by considering the systemic absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of nicotine as well as its overall pharmacokinetic behavior on GastroPlus version 9.9. Validation of the developed PBPK model was performed by comparing predicted and observed plasma concentration-time profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters from clinical studies across multiple routes of administration including intravenous infusion, bolus, and pulmonary inhalation. The resulting model accurately captured plasma nicotine concentrations, with predicted pharmacokinetic parameters (C(max), T(max) and AUCs) falling within acceptable ranges of observed values and computational average fold error values. The current model provides a practical tool to translate systemic nicotine exposure across delivery systems, support dose optimization against predefined target exposure, and quantify safety margins, thereby informing safer product design and evidence-based decisions in public-health regulatory science.",tobacco major caus chronic diseas lung cancer cardiovascular diseas chronic obstruct pulmonari diseas worldwid nicotin primari psychoact compon tobacco highli addict primari driver tobaccorel diseas pose variou health risk particularli affect cardiovascular pulmonari system although nicotinebas therapi nicotin replac product wide util smoke cessat effort today impact newer tobacco deliveri system electron nicotin deliveri system end remain uncertain warrant continu evalu studi aim develop valid physiolog base pharmacokinet pbpk simul model nicotin use clinic pharmacokinet data pbpk simul model nicotin develop incorpor drugspecif systemspecif paramet consid system absorpt distribut metabol excret nicotin well overal pharmacokinet behavior gastroplu version 99 valid develop pbpk model perform compar predict observ plasma concentrationtim profil pharmacokinet paramet clinic studi across multipl rout administr includ intraven infus bolu pulmonari inhal result model accur captur plasma nicotin concentr predict pharmacokinet paramet cmax tmax auc fall within accept rang observ valu comput averag fold error valu current model provid practic tool translat system nicotin exposur across deliveri system support dose optim predefin target exposur quantifi safeti margin therebi inform safer product design evidencebas decis publichealth regulatori scienc
cancer,"While proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) show epidemiological associations with gastrointestinal disorders, their mechanistic basis remains unclear. The pharmacological effects of a drug are determined not only by its direct protein targets but also by genes involved in its metabolism and transport. Using two-sample Mendelian randomization and multi-ancestry cohorts (UKB/FinnGen), we systematically assessed genes encoding both direct targets of PPIs and key proteins involved in PPI pharmacokinetics across 24 gastrointestinal diseases. Validation included colocalization/SMR analyses, disease stratification, anatomical stratification, and HPA-based tissue expression profiling. Single-cell sequencing further elucidated target distribution. Finally, meta-analysis validates the correlation between PPI and gastrointestinal disorders. CYP2D6 emerged as the most pleiotropic locus (nine disease endpoints), demonstrating dose-dependent carcinogenic effects in hepatocellular/pancreatic cancers (OR = 1.36-1.58, p = 8.45 x 10(-24), OR = 1.43-1.56, p = 2.31 x 10(-72)) yet protective against acute/chronic pancreatitis (OR = 0.72-0.75, p = 1.26 x 10(-196), OR = 0.62-0.67, p = 1.39 x 10(-111)). ABCB1/SLC22A1 exhibited pan-gastrointestinal risk modulation. Anatomical stratification revealed context-dependent gene effects: SLC22A1 (esophageal), CYP2D6 (hepatic), and CYP2C19 (colorectal) showed opposing roles in carcinogenesis versus precancerous states. HPA profiling identified SLC22A3 as a pan-cancer candidate (moderate-high expression in 4 tumor types). Single-cell tumor data indicated AHR was enriched in tumor cells and significantly higher than in normal cells in all five tumor tissues. The finding suggests that AHR may be related to the potential gastrointestinal carcinogenicity of PPIs. The meta-analysis confirms a significant link between PPI use and increased gastrointestinal cancer risk. Further research is needed on PPI and benign gastrointestinal diseases. Our multi-omics integration reveals tissue-specific PPI pharmacodynamics, identifying targets with dual therapeutic/carcinogenic potential that may explain epidemiological discordances.",proton pump inhibitor ppi show epidemiolog associ gastrointestin disord mechanist basi remain unclear pharmacolog effect drug determin direct protein target also gene involv metabol transport use twosampl mendelian random multiancestri cohort ukbfinngen systemat assess gene encod direct target ppi key protein involv ppi pharmacokinet across 24 gastrointestin diseas valid includ colocalizationsmr analys diseas stratif anatom stratif hpabas tissu express profil singlecel sequenc elucid target distribut final metaanalysi valid correl ppi gastrointestin disord cyp2d6 emerg pleiotrop locu nine diseas endpoint demonstr dosedepend carcinogen effect hepatocellularpancreat cancer 136158 p 845 x 1024 143156 p 231 x 1072 yet protect acutechron pancreat 072075 p 126 x 10196 062067 p 139 x 10111 abcb1slc22a1 exhibit pangastrointestin risk modul anatom stratif reveal contextdepend gene effect slc22a1 esophag cyp2d6 hepat cyp2c19 colorect show oppos role carcinogenesi versu precancer state hpa profil identifi slc22a3 pancanc candid moderatehigh express 4 tumor type singlecel tumor data indic ahr enrich tumor cell significantli higher normal cell five tumor tissu find suggest ahr may relat potenti gastrointestin carcinogen ppi metaanalysi confirm signific link ppi use increas gastrointestin cancer risk research need ppi benign gastrointestin diseas multiom integr reveal tissuespecif ppi pharmacodynam identifi target dual therapeuticcarcinogen potenti may explain epidemiolog discord

cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of late effects after oncological treatment in Southeast Asia remains limited. This study is among the first comprehensive audits of late effects experienced by paediatric cancer survivors from the long-term follow-up (LTFU) clinic at KK Women's and Children's Hospital in Singapore, between September 2017 and December 2023. METHOD: A total of 485 survivors were examined, all of whom had at least 2 years of treatment and 5 years of remission. Data on cancer diagnoses, treatments and late effects were analysed, with severity classified by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. RESULTS: The analysis showed 394 survivors (81%) experienced at least 1 late effect. Body mass index >/=23 kg/m2 or >/=90th percentile, low bone mineral density (e.g. Z-score </=-2.0 standard deviation score) and hearing difficulties were observed in 149 (30.7%), 87 (17.9%) and 73 (15.1%) survivors, respectively. Leukaemia survivors' detection of their first late effect was 10-14 years postdiagnosis, while central nervous system (CNS) and solid tumour survivors detected their first late effect within </=5 years. Majority of late effects were of mild CTCAE severity. The odd ratio of developing late effects in the first 5 years post-diagnosis was 4.88 (95% confidence interval 2.98-7.71, P<0.001) in survivors treated with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy (with and without surgery) compared to chemotherapy (with and without surgery). CONCLUSION: Despite risk-adapted protocols, timely screening is recommended to improve early detection of metabolic health, bone health and hearing impairment. Radiotherapy-treated survivors and survivors of CNS tumours and solid tumours would benefit from earlier and frequent screening. Adopting an exposure-based approach to proactively screen for late effects, coupled with survivor education, can help mitigate the biopsychosocial impacts.",introduct knowledg late effect oncolog treatment southeast asia remain limit studi among first comprehens audit late effect experienc paediatr cancer survivor longterm followup ltfu clinic kk women children hospit singapor septemb 2017 decemb 2023 method total 485 survivor examin least 2 year treatment 5 year remiss data cancer diagnos treatment late effect analys sever classifi common terminolog criteria advers event ctcae version 50 result analysi show 394 survivor 81 experienc least 1 late effect bodi mass index 23 kgm2 90th percentil low bone miner densiti eg zscore 20 standard deviat score hear difficulti observ 149 307 87 179 73 151 survivor respect leukaemia survivor detect first late effect 1014 year postdiagnosi central nervou system cn solid tumour survivor detect first late effect within 5 year major late effect mild ctcae sever odd ratio develop late effect first 5 year postdiagnosi 488 95 confid interv 298771 p0001 survivor treat chemotherapi radiotherapi without surgeri compar chemotherapi without surgeri conclus despit riskadapt protocol time screen recommend improv earli detect metabol health bone health hear impair radiotherapytr survivor survivor cn tumour solid tumour would benefit earlier frequent screen adopt exposurebas approach proactiv screen late effect coupl survivor educ help mitig biopsychosoci impact
cancer,"This study modified the solvent-exposed region of sunitinib by replacing its diethylaminoethyl tail with linear and heterocyclic amines, guided by lipophilicity, steric, and electronic considerations to enhance the anticancer activity and selectivity. Sunitinib and its 20 derivatives, including 14 new compounds (4a, 4c, 4d, 4g-4i, 5a, 5b, 7a-7e, and 8) and 6 known compounds (4b, 4e-4f, 5c-5d, and 6), were successfully synthesized. The cytotoxic effects of sunitinib and its derivatives were evaluated against three human cancer cell lines (HeLa, SH-SY5Y, and HepG2) and one normal cell line (L929) using the MTT assay. Sunitinib exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity toward SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, with an IC(5)(0) of 3.88 microM. Among the derivatives, compound 5b showed the highest potency with an IC(5)(0) of 4.28 microM against SH-SY5Y. Compound 6 displayed the highest selectivity index (SI >/= 5) for HeLa, indicating good selectivity toward cancer over normal cells. Overall, these results suggest that targeted modification of the solvent-exposed region in sunitinib can improve anticancer activity without toxicity against normal cell lines, with compound 5b emerging as a promising lead for further development, particularly against neuroblastoma. The solvent-exposed region is strategic for drug development, allowing modifications that improve affinity, selectivity, solubility, and pharmacokinetics without disrupting ligand-protein interactions.",studi modifi solventexpos region sunitinib replac diethylaminoethyl tail linear heterocycl amin guid lipophil steric electron consider enhanc anticanc activ select sunitinib 20 deriv includ 14 new compound 4a 4c 4d 4g4i 5a 5b 7a7e 8 6 known compound 4b 4e4f 5c5d 6 success synthes cytotox effect sunitinib deriv evalu three human cancer cell line hela shsy5i hepg2 one normal cell line l929 use mtt assay sunitinib exhibit strongest cytotox toward shsy5i neuroblastoma cell ic50 388 microm among deriv compound 5b show highest potenc ic50 428 microm shsy5i compound 6 display highest select index si 5 hela indic good select toward cancer normal cell overal result suggest target modif solventexpos region sunitinib improv anticanc activ without toxic normal cell line compound 5b emerg promis lead develop particularli neuroblastoma solventexpos region strateg drug develop allow modif improv affin select solubl pharmacokinet without disrupt ligandprotein interact
cancer,"Solid tumors are characterized by a metabolically dysregulated tumor microenvironment (TME) enriched with reactive oxygen species (ROS), which suppresses immune cell function. Natural killer (NK) cells are promising effectors in cancer immunotherapy due to their intrinsic cytotoxicity without prior antigen sensitization. However, oxidative stress impairs NK cell cytotoxicity by reducing degranulation, interferon-gamma production, and survival. Therefore, maintaining NK cell redox balance is a crucial obstacle to achieving optimal therapeutic results in ROS-rich TMEs. Here, we proposed a straightforward, non-genetic ex vivo membrane modification approach to reinforce the redox balance of NK cells via ROS scavenging. Using tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), a mild reducing agent, we selectively introduced free thiol groups onto the exterior surface of NK cell plasma membranes. The engineered surface-thiol-riched NK cells (STR-NK) demonstrated (1) increased membrane thiols, (2) efficiently eliminated extracellular ROS, (3) attenuated intracellular ROS accumulation, and (4) preserved cytotoxicity-associated gene expression under oxidative stress. Importantly, STR-NK cells maintained potent cytotoxicity against diverse solid tumor cells despite the presence of ROS. Overall, this uncomplicated and scalable surface redox modulation approach enhances NK cell anticancer activity under oxidative stress, offering a promising strategy to improve NK cell-based cancer immunotherapies in ROS-enriched solid TMEs.",solid tumor character metabol dysregul tumor microenviron tme enrich reactiv oxygen speci ro suppress immun cell function natur killer nk cell promis effector cancer immunotherapi due intrins cytotox without prior antigen sensit howev oxid stress impair nk cell cytotox reduc degranul interferongamma product surviv therefor maintain nk cell redox balanc crucial obstacl achiev optim therapeut result rosrich tme propos straightforward nongenet ex vivo membran modif approach reinforc redox balanc nk cell via ro scaveng use tris2carboxyethylphosphin tcep mild reduc agent select introduc free thiol group onto exterior surfac nk cell plasma membran engin surfacethiolrich nk cell strnk demonstr 1 increas membran thiol 2 effici elimin extracellular ro 3 attenu intracellular ro accumul 4 preserv cytotoxicityassoci gene express oxid stress importantli strnk cell maintain potent cytotox divers solid tumor cell despit presenc ro overal uncompl scalabl surfac redox modul approach enhanc nk cell anticanc activ oxid stress offer promis strategi improv nk cellbas cancer immunotherapi rosenrich solid tme
cancer,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting cell-surface molecules are pivotal in biomedical research, diagnostic applications, and biotechnology. Over the past four decades, the CD nomenclature system, established by the Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens Workshops and endorsed by the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS), has provided a standardized naming convention for both mAbs and the cell surface molecules they target. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest family of cell-surface receptors, playing essential roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Despite their significance, GPCRs are underrepresented in terms of well-validated mAbs available for flow cytometry and therapeutic applications. At the Eleventh HLDA Workshop (HLDA11), new CD nomenclature has been assigned to thirteen GPCR cell-surface molecules expressed on immune cells: CD198 (CCR8), CD199 (CCR9), CD372 (CCR10), CD373 (CX3CR1), CD374 (XCR1), CD375 (GPR15), CDw376 (GPR26), CD377 (SSTR3), CD378 (C3AR1), CDw379 (FPR2), CD380 (LTB4R), CDw381 (GPR183), and CDw382 (F2RL1). In this article, we introduce the newly established CD nomenclature for mAbs targeting the GPCR family. We detail the quantitative expression profiles of these molecules on various subsets of leukocytes and provide validation data for these mAbs. The implications of these expression profiles are discussed for the potential therapeutic targeting of immune-mediated diseases and cancer.",monoclon antibodi mab target cellsurfac molecul pivot biomed research diagnost applic biotechnolog past four decad cd nomenclatur system establish human leukocyt differenti antigen workshop endors intern union immunolog societi iui provid standard name convent mab cell surfac molecul target g proteincoupl receptor gpcr repres largest famili cellsurfac receptor play essenti role innat adapt immun respons despit signific gpcr underrepres term wellvalid mab avail flow cytometri therapeut applic eleventh hlda workshop hlda11 new cd nomenclatur assign thirteen gpcr cellsurfac molecul express immun cell cd198 ccr8 cd199 ccr9 cd372 ccr10 cd373 cx3cr1 cd374 xcr1 cd375 gpr15 cdw376 gpr26 cd377 sstr3 cd378 c3ar1 cdw379 fpr2 cd380 ltb4r cdw381 gpr183 cdw382 f2rl1 articl introduc newli establish cd nomenclatur mab target gpcr famili detail quantit express profil molecul variou subset leukocyt provid valid data mab implic express profil discuss potenti therapeut target immunemedi diseas cancer

The overlap propensity score weighting method was applied to account for known confounding. Cox regression analysis and weighted cox regression analysis were used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).ResultsA total of 247 patients with p16-negative OPSCC (median follow-up duration: 39 months; 3-year OS: 84.9%; 3-year DSS: 89.5%) and 1175 patients with p16-positive OPSCC (median follow-up duration: 35 months; 3-year OS: 95.3%; 3-year DSS: 96.7%) were included. Adjuvant radiotherapy was associated with improved OS [weighted HR (95% CI): 0.37 (0.17-0.79)] and DSS [weighted HR (95% CI): 0.34 (0.13-0.88)] in pT1-2N1-2b p16-negative OPSCC. No prognostic role of adjuvant radiotherapy was observed in pN1 subgroup of p16-negative OPSCC [weighted HR (95% CI) for OS: 0.89 (0.20-4.06); weighted HR (95% CI) for DSS: 1.12 (0.19-6.71)]. Adjuvant radiotherapy was associated with improved OS [weighted HR (95% CI): 0.34 (0.18-0.62)] and DSS [weighted HR (95% CI): 0.30 (0.14-0.64)] in pT1-2N1-2b p16-positive OPSCC. Subgroup analyses of p16-positive OPSCC, including pN1, pN2a-2b, and positive lymph nodes </=4 subgroups, supported that adjuvant radiotherapy had positive prognostic role.Conclusions and RelevanceConsistent with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, patients with pT1-2N2a-2b OPSCC should receive adjuvant radiotherapy (regardless of p16 status), while patients with pT1-2N1 p16-negative OPSCC could consider omitting adjuvant radiotherapy.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: The HIT-CRAD trial (ISRCTN57028065) is the first to combine home-based non-invasive brain stimulation with high-volume strength and skill training over 8 weeks in patients with chronic radiation-associated dysphagia (CRAD) following primary (chemo)radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. METHODS: Fifty-four patients were randomized into three groups. Group 1 performed 8 weeks of strength training. Groups 2 and 3 combined 4 weeks of strength training with 4 weeks of skill training. Group 3 received high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) during training. Group 2 received sham HD-tDCS. RESULTS: Overall adherence and exercise adherence remained above 75% across all groups. Home-based HD-tDCS proved safe and feasible, with mild to moderate side effects (tingling, itching, or burning). Median exercise performance levels for strength training exercises ranged from 94% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the feasibility of high-volume strength and skill training with HD-tDCS in patients with C-RAD. Proactive adherence-supporting factors facilitate high adherence in this population. Both real and sham HD-tDCS proved safe, feasible, and well tolerated.

cancer,"IntroductionCancer among the oldest-old (aged >/=85) is an escalating public health concern, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), where demographic aging is advancing rapidly.MethodsWe analyzed cancer incidence and mortality trends among the oldest-old in MENA from 1990 to 2021 using Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 data, and compared these trends to global patterns.ResultsCancer incidence and mortality among the oldest-old in MENA increased substantially, surpassing global trends. Between 1990 and 2021, incidence rose by 54.2% in MENA vs 25.3% globally, while mortality increased by 17.6% vs 3.1% globally. Females experienced steeper rises in both incidence and mortality. Annual percent change (APC) in MENA incidence was +1.96 (95% CI: 1.28-2.64) for females and +0.83 (95% CI: 0.59-1.08) for males, compared to +0.28 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.38) and +0.47 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.55) globally. APC for mortality in MENA was +1.27 (95% CI: 0.66-1.88) for females and +0.33 (95% CI: 0.12-0.54) for males, vs -0.07 (95% CI: -0.13, 0.0) and +0.11 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.18) globally. Leading cancers were prostate, lung, and colorectal for males, and breast, colorectal, and lung for females, with variation across countries.ConclusionThe rising cancer burden among the oldest-old in MENA underscores the urgent need for targeted interventions. Strengthening preventive measures, improving healthcare access, enhancing cancer registration, and implementing tailored screening and treatment strategies are critical.

cancer,"The immune system orchestrates a delicate balance between robust defense against pathogens and restraint to prevent tissue damage, with T cells serving as central mediators of adaptive immunity. The canonical pathway for T-cell activation hinges on the precise recognition of peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules via the T-cell receptor (TCR), which is complemented by essential co-stimulatory signals. However, this model alone cannot fully explain the nuanced contextualization of immune responses, particularly how T cells integrate signals related to the nature of the threat. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which are traditionally studied in innate immune cells, are recognized as critical regulators of T cell function, challenging the conventional dichotomy between innate and adaptive immunity. T cell-intrinsic PRR signaling integrates endogenous danger signals and microbes to modulate critical processes, including cytokine production, proliferation, and polarization, thereby shaping immune responses and disease outcomes in contexts ranging from viral infections to chronic inflammation and cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying PRR-mediated T cell regulation and their contributions to immune homeostasis or pathology remain incompletely understood. This study investigates the role of T cell-intrinsic PRR signaling in shaping immune responses and its implications for disease. By elucidating key signaling pathways and their impact on T cell function, we aim to offer novel insights into the complex regulation of T cell-mediated immunity and uncover an underappreciated paradigm for immune-related disorders, providing new insights into the pathogenesis of inflammatory and neoplastic diseases.",immun system orchestr delic balanc robust defens pathogen restraint prevent tissu damag cell serv central mediat adapt immun canon pathway tcell activ hing precis recognit peptid antigen present major histocompat complex mhc molecul via tcell receptor tcr complement essenti costimulatori signal howev model alon fulli explain nuanc contextu immun respons particularli cell integr signal relat natur threat pattern recognit receptor prr tradit studi innat immun cell recogn critic regul cell function challeng convent dichotomi innat adapt immun cellintrins prr signal integr endogen danger signal microb modul critic process includ cytokin product prolifer polar therebi shape immun respons diseas outcom context rang viral infect chronic inflamm cancer howev molecular mechan underli prrmediat cell regul contribut immun homeostasi patholog remain incomplet understood studi investig role cellintrins prr signal shape immun respons implic diseas elucid key signal pathway impact cell function aim offer novel insight complex regul cellmedi immun uncov underappreci paradigm immunerel disord provid new insight pathogenesi inflammatori neoplast diseas
cancer,"ObjectiveBreast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy frequently experience psychological distress that negatively impacts treatment outcomes and quality of life. Evidence for structured psychological interventions during radiotherapy remains limited. This study evaluated the longitudinal effects of a structured education plus entertainment therapy intervention on anxiety, depression, and quality of life in mainland China breast cancer patients during and after radiotherapy using linear mixed model analysis.MethodsThis single-center, parallel-group, assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial enrolled 280 female breast cancer patients (aged 18-75 years) receiving adjuvant radiotherapy. Participants were randomized 1:1 to intervention (structured education plus entertainment therapy) or control (standard care). Primary outcomes were Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) trajectories assessed at baseline (T0), mid-radiotherapy (T1), end of radiotherapy (T2), and 1, 3, and 6 months post-radiotherapy (T3-T5). Secondary outcomes included quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30/BR23 domains), acute toxicity (CTCAE v5.0), and adherence. Linear mixed models with group x time interaction assessed intervention effects.ResultsOf 280 randomized patients, 252 (90%) completed the T5 assessment. The intervention group showed significantly improved SAS trajectory (group x time interaction beta = -1.82, 95% CI: -3.14 to -0.50, P = 0.007) with estimated marginal mean difference of -3.45 points at T5. SDS trajectory improvement was marginally significant (beta = -1.56, 95% CI: -3.12 to 0.01, P = 0.051). Minimal clinically important difference (MCID, >/=0.5 SD improvement) was achieved by 48.6% vs 31.4% for anxiety (P = 0.004) and 42.1% vs 29.3% for depression (P = 0.027) for intervention and control groups, respectively. Global health status improved significantly (beta = 4.23, P < 0.001). Grade >/=2 radiation dermatitis occurred in 37.1% vs 48.6% (P = 0.055) in intervention and control groups, respectively. High adherence (>/=70% sessions) in 72.1% of intervention patients was associated with greater benefits.ConclusionsThe structured education plus entertainment therapy intervention demonstrated small-to-moderate clinically meaningful improvements in anxiety, depression, and quality of life during radiotherapy, with effects persisting through 6-month follow-up.

cancer,"Lip squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) accounts for approximately 30% of oral malignancies. Delayed diagnosis worsens the prognosis, leading to tumor growth, regional lymph node involvement, distant metastasis, and the need for invasive therapy. Dermoscopy is a practical, low-cost, and non-invasive diagnostic tool used to detect skin tumors. This review analyzed the common dermoscopic features of lip SCC and actinic cheilitis (AC). A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science was made for original dermatoscopy studies. Pooled proportions were calculated using a random-effects model (95% CI). Eleven studies were included: 325 patients, 205 lip SCCs, and 122 ACs. Key dermoscopic findings in lip SCCs were white structureless areas 61.9%, ulceration 59.3%, white halos 57.7%, keratin scales 54.98%, pinkish-red background 50.5%, whitish-yellow colors 41.8%, and shiny white streaks 24.5%. Polymorphous vessels were found in 55.8%, and monomorphous in 44.1%. Vessel morphology was hairpin 30.90%, serpentine 22.27%, dotted 21.46%, and glomerular 11.20%. ACs exhibited white halos in 66.14% of cases, white structureless areas in 59.62%, white scales in 57.90%, yellow scales in 30.14%, ulceration in 32.43%, white circles in 9.94%, and had polymorphous (72.93%), hairpin (30.83%), or dotted (20.71%) vessels. Dermoscopy aids early detection of lip SCC and AC, though overlapping features can limit accurate distinction.

cancer,"This review is part of a special memorial issue in honor of Erich Sackmann's remarkable research career, in particular, on the biophysics of equilibrium and living membranes. Erich's large body of discoveries firmly established him as a giant in the field of biophysics. In our review, we describe structural studies of microtubules (MTs) in the presence of the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau, an intrinsically disordered protein confined to the axon of mature neurons in vertebrates. We start with a brief review of experiments where the inherently dynamical MT is fixed with the cancer chemotherapy drug molecule paclitaxel (PTX). At a PTX to tubulin-dimer molar ratio of 1, tau is found to modulate the protofilament number of MTs with a tendency to increase the MT diameter. Under these high paclitaxel/tubulin molar ratios, where a vast amount of comprehensive literature on the high-resolution structure of tubulin and MTs exists, tau does not mediate bundling interactions between MTs. The review further describes more recent structural studies, which combine synchrotron small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) with electron microscopy of plastic embedded preparations. The studies, focus on elucidating the steady-state assembled structures emerging from reaction mixtures of tubulin, tau, and GTP at 37 degrees C, all in the absence of paclitaxel. The mixtures contained either no added magnesium (aside from the 1 mM Mg(2+) present in the buffer), or up to a few mM of Mg(2+) comparable to cellular concentrations are intended to provide samples for studies to clarify the effects of cellular metal ions on tubulin/tau assemblies. The combined paclitaxel-free studies represent a minimal cell free model of the MT cytoskeleton found in the central core of the axon initial segment (AIS) of mature neurons. SAXS and TEM revealed out-of-equilibrium steady-state structures with hexagonal and linear symmetries (in cross-section), and large MT wall-to-wall spacing greater than the diameter of MTs. The spacings and linear MT architecture resemble the morphology of MT fascicles found in the AIS. SAXS of reaction mixtures combined with TEM imaging of plastic embedded samples provided evidence that microtubules are bundled and stabilized by an intervening network of complexes of tubulin oligomers and tau.",review part special memori issu honor erich sackmann remark research career particular biophys equilibrium live membran erich larg bodi discoveri firmli establish giant field biophys review describ structur studi microtubul mt presenc microtubuleassoci protein map tau intrins disord protein confin axon matur neuron vertebr start brief review experi inher dynam mt fix cancer chemotherapi drug molecul paclitaxel ptx ptx tubulindim molar ratio 1 tau found modul protofila number mt tendenc increas mt diamet high paclitaxeltubulin molar ratio vast amount comprehens literatur highresolut structur tubulin mt exist tau mediat bundl interact mt review describ recent structur studi combin synchrotron smallangl xray scatter sax electron microscopi plastic embed prepar studi focu elucid steadyst assembl structur emerg reaction mixtur tubulin tau gtp 37 degre c absenc paclitaxel mixtur contain either ad magnesium asid 1 mm mg2 present buffer mm mg2 compar cellular concentr intend provid sampl studi clarifi effect cellular metal ion tubulintau assembl combin paclitaxelfre studi repres minim cell free model mt cytoskeleton found central core axon initi segment ai matur neuron sax tem reveal outofequilibrium steadyst structur hexagon linear symmetri crosssect larg mt walltowal space greater diamet mt space linear mt architectur resembl morpholog mt fascicl found ai sax reaction mixtur combin tem imag plastic embed sampl provid evid microtubul bundl stabil interven network complex tubulin oligom tau
cancer,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the fourth most commonly diagnosed malignancy worldwide and remains a major clinical challenge due to its heterogeneous course and lack of reliable prognostic biomarkers. Mitochondrial ribosomal protein L23 (MRPL23) has recently emerged as a potential contributor to cancer progression, but its role in prostate cancer remains poorly understood. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from 67 PCa patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were analyzed. MRPL23 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry using a semi-quantitative immunoreactive scale (IRS). Clinicopathological data were collected for correlation analysis. Survival outcomes were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models. MRPL23 expression differed significantly across all tissue types, with higher levels in prostate cancer tissues compared with normal epithelium, and the highest expression observed in lymph node metastases (P < .001). High MRPL23 expression was associated with shorter overall survival (P = .003) and remained an independent prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis (HR 3.99, 95% CI 1.63-9.77, P = .002). Complementary TCGA analysis confirmed elevated MRPL23 mRNA levels in prostate adenocarcinomas compared with normal tissues (P = .01) and demonstrated that high expression predicted shorter disease-free survival (10-year DFS: 75.98% versus 92.92%, log-rank P = .01). MRPL23 is a potential prognostic biomarker in prostate cancer, linked to aggressive tumor behavior and poor outcomes. Its expression in metastatic tissue suggests a role in disease progression, while TCGA data confirm its prognostic value for recurrence risk. MRPL23 may also serve as a therapeutic target in advanced PCa.",prostat cancer pca fourth commonli diagnos malign worldwid remain major clinic challeng due heterogen cours lack reliabl prognost biomark mitochondri ribosom protein l23 mrpl23 recent emerg potenti contributor cancer progress role prostat cancer remain poorli understood formalinfix paraffinembed ffpe tissu sampl 67 pca patient underw radic prostatectomi analyz mrpl23 express assess immunohistochemistri use semiquantit immunoreact scale ir clinicopatholog data collect correl analysi surviv outcom evalu use kaplanmei curv cox proport hazard model mrpl23 express differ significantli across tissu type higher level prostat cancer tissu compar normal epithelium highest express observ lymph node metastas p 001 high mrpl23 express associ shorter overal surviv p 003 remain independ prognost factor multivari analysi hr 399 95 ci 163977 p 002 complementari tcga analysi confirm elev mrpl23 mrna level prostat adenocarcinoma compar normal tissu p 01 demonstr high express predict shorter diseasefre surviv 10year df 7598 versu 9292 logrank p 01 mrpl23 potenti prognost biomark prostat cancer link aggress tumor behavior poor outcom express metastat tissu suggest role diseas progress tcga data confirm prognost valu recurr risk mrpl23 may also serv therapeut target advanc pca
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma (NB) is a childhood cancer of the sympathetic nervous system, and its prognosis is poor. NB cells undergo transcriptional changes to utilise aerobic glycolysis as their primary metabolic pathway, which provides an immediate source of ATP to meet high biosynthetic demands. Alternative metabolic fuel inputs, including ketone bodies which require oxidative phosphorylation, may impact the proliferative capacity of NB. AIMS: In this exploratory study, the expression of glycolytic and ketolytic genes in the context of MYCN oncogene amplification, tumour staging 1-4 and Kaplan-Meier survivability was investigated using the R2: Genomics analysis and visualisation platform (http://r2.amc.nl), database. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three NB genomics datasets were assessed in the R2 platform and further analysed in GraphPad Prism to investigate the relationships between glycolytic and ketolytic gene expression and prognosis. Glycolytic gene expression is increased in MYCN amplified, metastatic tumours and is associated with worse event free survival. Ketolytic gene expression is lower in metastatic tumours and is associated with better event free survivability. The glycolytic gene expression profile of NB suggests that elevated levels correlate with a low probability of survival. Ketolytic gene expression patterns suggest a decreased reliance for ketolytic energy, which may be exploited to slow tumourigenic growth. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates glycolytic and ketolytic gene expression profiles in metastatic and MYCN amplified NB tumours and through conditional analysis suggests the potential use of these genes in prognosis prediction. Furthermore, the study highlights the reliability and utility of genomic databases as oncogenomic tools for NB research.",background neuroblastoma nb childhood cancer sympathet nervou system prognosi poor nb cell undergo transcript chang utilis aerob glycolysi primari metabol pathway provid immedi sourc atp meet high biosynthet demand altern metabol fuel input includ keton bodi requir oxid phosphoryl may impact prolif capac nb aim exploratori studi express glycolyt ketolyt gene context mycn oncogen amplif tumour stage 14 kaplanmei surviv investig use r2 genom analysi visualis platform httpr2amcnl databas method result three nb genom dataset assess r2 platform analys graphpad prism investig relationship glycolyt ketolyt gene express prognosi glycolyt gene express increas mycn amplifi metastat tumour associ wors event free surviv ketolyt gene express lower metastat tumour associ better event free surviv glycolyt gene express profil nb suggest elev level correl low probabl surviv ketolyt gene express pattern suggest decreas relianc ketolyt energi may exploit slow tumourigen growth conclus studi valid glycolyt ketolyt gene express profil metastat mycn amplifi nb tumour condit analysi suggest potenti use gene prognosi predict furthermor studi highlight reliabl util genom databas oncogenom tool nb research
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer; however, the mechanisms driving metabolic heterogeneity across diverse cell types in the tumor microenvironment remain poorly understood. Most existing methods predict metabolic states at the pathway level but rarely map reaction-level alterations to their upstream regulators, thereby constraining both interpretability and translational relevance. METHODS: We developed MetroSCREEN, a reference-guided computational framework that infers reaction-level metabolic flux propensity and nominates upstream regulators from bulk and single-cell transcriptomes. MetroSCREEN uses a fast enrichment-based procedure to quantify reaction-level metabolic activity. To characterize metabolic regulons, it integrates intrinsic gene-regulatory signals with extrinsic cell-cell interaction cues, then applies a robust multi-evidence ranking scheme to combine these information sources, and finally employs a constraint-based causal discovery module to infer regulatory directionality. RESULTS: MetroSCREEN accurately predicts reaction-level metabolic activities and their upstream regulators, as demonstrated using paired transcriptomic-metabolomic datasets from the cancer cell lines. We further validated predicted regulators with in-house single-cell CRISPR screens in PC9 cells targeting metabolic regulators. Applying MetroSCREEN to a pan-cancer single-cell atlas of more than 700,000 fibroblasts and myeloid cells across 36 cancer types, we identified ZNF281 and STAT1 as key regulators of collagen metabolism, which is elevated in extracellular-matrix-associated fibroblasts and macrophages at tumor margins. By contrast, APOE and KLF7 regulate sphingolipid metabolism and antigen presentation in macrophages. Leveraging extensive tumor profiles, MetroSCREEN also delineates metabolic subtypes and regulators associated with patient survival and response to immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: MetroSCREEN is a robust and scalable approach for characterizing metabolic heterogeneity and pinpointing metabolic regulators at single-cell resolution, unveiling novel antitumor targets for future metabolic interventions.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology, with pulmonary involvement being the most common and clinically significant manifestation. Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) plays a key role in leukocyte trafficking to inflamed tissues. [(6)(8)Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 is a novel PET radiotracer that binds to VAP-1. This proof-of-concept study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of [(68)Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 PET/CT for imaging pulmonary sarcoidosis. METHODS: Six patients with stage 2 pulmonary sarcoidosis (age 50.5 +/- 13.1 years; bodyweight 84.2 +/- 14.7 kg), diagnosed by clinical, radiological, and histological findings, underwent [(68)Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 PET/CT. Control subjects included six healthy male volunteers (age 37.5 +/- 10.3 years; bodyweight 80.3 +/- 3.9 kg) and one female patient with lung cancer (age 77 years; bodyweight 62 kg). Tracer uptake was quantified in the lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes, and organs involved in systemic inflammation. RESULTS: Patients with sarcoidosis showed significantly higher [(68)Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 uptake in the lungs (SUV(mean) 1.82 +/- 0.52 vs. 0.41 +/- 0.08; P = 0.00006) and mediastinal lymph nodes (SUV(mean) 2.06 +/- 0.46 vs. 0.89 +/- 0.26; P = 0.0003) compared to healthy controls. Increased uptake was also observed in the liver (SUV(mean) 1.18 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.80 +/- 0.10, P = 0.0003), spleen (SUV(mean) 1.13 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.82 +/- 0.06, P = 0.00003), bone marrow (SUV(mean) 0.30 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.06 +/- 0.05, P = 0.001), and bone (SUV(mean) 0.27 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.08 +/- 0.04, P = 0.004), indicating systemic inflammation.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Cancer significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality among incarcerated populations globally, yet research on cancer characteristics and outcomes in this vulnerable group remains limited. The purpose of this study is to compare sociodemographic factors, main tumor characteristics, treatment modalities, and survival rates between cancer patients managed within a prison hospitalization unit (PHU) and those treated in a community hospital. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, comparing 63 cancer patients from the PHU with 129 matched controls from the general population, matched by tumor type and age. Sociodemographic variables, risk factors, tumor types, treatment and survival were analyzed. Chi-square tests and Student's t tests were used for group comparisons, and Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank tests were applied for survival analysis. The statistical significance level considered was 5% (SPSS v29). RESULTS: The prison population had a higher prevalence of smoking (74.6% vs. 60.5%), alcohol consumption (50.8% vs. 36.4%), and other substance use (25.4% vs. 14.7%) (p < 0.001). The most common types of tumors were gastrointestinal (12%), prostate (9%), and head and neck (9%). Survival was lower for head/neck cancer patients in the PHU and higher in lung cancer patients (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Incarcerated cancer patients presented a higher prevalence of risk factors but received similar oncological treatments compared to community controls. Survival was poorer for head and neck cancers and unexpectedly better for lung cancer, although these findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size. The integrated prison-hospital model may reduce treatment disparities, but barriers to early diagnosis and follow-up remain.",background cancer significantli contribut morbid mortal among incarcer popul global yet research cancer characterist outcom vulner group remain limit purpos studi compar sociodemograph factor main tumor characterist treatment modal surviv rate cancer patient manag within prison hospit unit phu treat commun hospit method retrospect cohort studi conduct compar 63 cancer patient phu 129 match control gener popul match tumor type age sociodemograph variabl risk factor tumor type treatment surviv analyz chisquar test student test use group comparison kaplanmei curv logrank test appli surviv analysi statist signific level consid 5 spss v29 result prison popul higher preval smoke 746 vs 605 alcohol consumpt 508 vs 364 substanc use 254 vs 147 p 0001 common type tumor gastrointestin 12 prostat 9 head neck 9 surviv lower headneck cancer patient phu higher lung cancer patient p 0005 conclus incarcer cancer patient present higher preval risk factor receiv similar oncolog treatment compar commun control surviv poorer head neck cancer unexpectedli better lung cancer although find interpret cautious due small sampl size integr prisonhospit model may reduc treatment dispar barrier earli diagnosi followup remain
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Chronic ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a leading cause of cardiovascular-related mortality worldwide, with a growing burden among cancer patients due to shared risk factors and treatment-related Cardiotoxicity. However, nationwide trends and disparities in IHD-related mortality among cancer patients remain unexplored. METHODOLOGY: This study utilized CDC WONDER mortality data from 1999 to 2020, identifying U.S. adults (>/= 25 years) with cancer (ICD-10: C00-D48) who died from chronic IHD (ICD-10: I25) as the underlying cause. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) and annual percent changes (APCs) were calculated and stratified by gender, age, race, geographic region, and urbanization level. RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2020, there were 246,664 Chronic IHD-related deaths among adult cancer patients. The AAMR declined significantly from 8.44 per 100,000 in 1999 to 3.71 in 2020. A steady decline occurred from 1999 to 2018 (APC: -3.85%; 95% CI: -4.01 to -3.72), followed by a slight increase from 2018 to 2020 (APC: 2.92%; 95% CI: 0.33 to 4.70). Men had higher AAMRs than women (8.16 vs. 3.25). The highest CMR were observed in older adults (24.19), with significantly lower rates in middle-aged (1.26) and young adults (0.04). Racial disparities revealed the highest AAMRs in non-Hispanic Black individuals (5.64), followed by non-Hispanic Whites (5.37), NH American Indian (3.59), Hispanics (3.28), and NH Asians (2.7). Geographic trends showed that the Northeast had the highest AAMRs (6.88), while urban areas had slightly higher mortality than rural areas (5.23 vs. 5.06). CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide analysis highlights a significant decline in chronic IHD-related mortality among cancer patients, with persistent disparities by gender, age, race, and geographic location. The recent rise in AAMRs after 2018 suggests emerging risk factors that warrant further investigation. Addressing these disparities through targeted cardiovascular risk management in cancer patients is crucial to improving long-term outcomes.",background chronic ischem heart diseas ihd lead caus cardiovascularrel mortal worldwid grow burden among cancer patient due share risk factor treatmentrel cardiotox howev nationwid trend dispar ihdrel mortal among cancer patient remain unexplor methodolog studi util cdc wonder mortal data 1999 2020 identifi us adult 25 year cancer icd10 c00d48 die chronic ihd icd10 i25 underli caus ageadjust mortal rate aamr annual percent chang apc calcul stratifi gender age race geograph region urban level result 1999 2020 246664 chronic ihdrel death among adult cancer patient aamr declin significantli 844 per 100000 1999 371 2020 steadi declin occur 1999 2018 apc 385 95 ci 401 372 follow slight increas 2018 2020 apc 292 95 ci 033 470 men higher aamr women 816 vs 325 highest cmr observ older adult 2419 significantli lower rate middleag 126 young adult 004 racial dispar reveal highest aamr nonhispan black individu 564 follow nonhispan white 537 nh american indian 359 hispan 328 nh asian 27 geograph trend show northeast highest aamr 688 urban area slightli higher mortal rural area 523 vs 506 conclus nationwid analysi highlight signific declin chronic ihdrel mortal among cancer patient persist dispar gender age race geograph locat recent rise aamr 2018 suggest emerg risk factor warrant investig address dispar target cardiovascular risk manag cancer patient crucial improv longterm outcom
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Dedifferentiated (DC) and poorly differentiated chordomas (PDC) are rare, aggressive chordomas with a significantly worse prognosis than conventional chordomas (CC). The molecular mechanisms driving them remain poorly understood. METHODS: Matched primary CC and recurrent DC cryopreserved samples from one patient were analyzed with whole-exome sequencing (WES). Samples from three additional DCs and one PDC underwent targeted sequencing of cancer-related genes. Furthermore, 102 CC cases - 32 novel and 70 from literature, were analyzed. Functional and survival analysis was performed. RESULTS: WES revealed striking genomic changes during progression from CC to DC, with the number of somatic mutations increasing from 211 in primary to 430 in the recurrent DC; recurrence acquired TP53 and BRCA1 deleterious mutations, along with copy-number alterations, including loss of 6q containing the TBXT locus. Targeted sequencing identified TP53 mutations in 4/5 DC&PDC cases compared to 1/102 cases in combined CC cohorts (p = 2.7x10(-5), OR=162.9). In 3 recurrent DC samples with TP53 variant, presence of the mutation was assessed in primary CC sample and in neither, this variant was found. Literature review revealed TP53 mutations in 9/23 (39%) DC&PDC cases versus 5/445 (1.24%) CC cases. Survival analysis demonstrated that TP53 mutations confer a significantly worse prognosis in DC patients (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: TP53 mutations are acquired during chordoma progression and are associated with an aggressive phenotype; TP53 sequencing could serve as a prognostic and potentially predictive biomarker in aggressive chordomas.",introduct dedifferenti dc poorli differenti chordoma pdc rare aggress chordoma significantli wors prognosi convent chordoma cc molecular mechan drive remain poorli understood method match primari cc recurr dc cryopreserv sampl one patient analyz wholeexom sequenc we sampl three addit dc one pdc underw target sequenc cancerrel gene furthermor 102 cc case 32 novel 70 literatur analyz function surviv analysi perform result we reveal strike genom chang progress cc dc number somat mutat increas 211 primari 430 recurr dc recurr acquir tp53 brca1 deleteri mutat along copynumb alter includ loss 6q contain tbxt locu target sequenc identifi tp53 mutat 45 dcpdc case compar 1102 case combin cc cohort p 27x105 or1629 3 recurr dc sampl tp53 variant presenc mutat assess primari cc sampl neither variant found literatur review reveal tp53 mutat 923 39 dcpdc case versu 5445 124 cc case surviv analysi demonstr tp53 mutat confer significantli wors prognosi dc patient p 003 conclus tp53 mutat acquir chordoma progress associ aggress phenotyp tp53 sequenc could serv prognost potenti predict biomark aggress chordoma
cancer,"Cisplatin resistance remains a major challenge in the clinical treatment of bladder cancer (BC), and the epigenetic regulation of this resistance, particularly involving 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the role of 5hmC and vitamin C (VC) in modulating cisplatin sensitivity in BC. Clinical analyses of 36 BC patients receiving cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed that reduced 5hmC levels in pre-chemotherapy tumor tissues were significantly associated with cisplatin resistance (CR-BC) and poor prognosis, with low 5hmC correlating with shorter progression-free survival (PFS). In vitro, we established two cisplatin-resistant cell lines (T24-CR, UMUC-3-CR) that exhibited reduced 5hmC compared to parental cells. Treatment with 100 muM VC significantly restored 5hmC levels in CR-BC cells by activating TET enzymes, inhibited cell proliferation, and enhanced cisplatin sensitivity; these effects were abrogated by the TET inhibitor Bobcat339, confirming VC acts in a TET-dependent manner. Mechanistically, genome-wide 850 K methylation array and RNA-seq analyses revealed that VC upregulated methylation specifically at the promoter of ATF4, a downstream effector of the MAPK pathway, thereby downregulating ATF4 expression. ATF4 knockdown in CR-BC cells increasing cisplatin sensitivity, while Bobcat339 reversed VC-induced ATF4 downregulation. In vivo, VC combined with cisplatin significantly inhibited tumor growth in T24-CR xenografts, and co-treatment with ATF4 knockdown further enhanced this effect, accompanied by elevated 5hmC and reduced Ki67 in tumors. Collectively, our findings identify reduced 5hmC as a hallmark of cisplatin-resistant BC and reveal a novel mechanism by which VC enhances cisplatin sensitivity. VC activates TET enzymes to increase 5mC at the ATF4 promoter, downregulating ATF4 and modulating the MAPK pathway. This highlights VC as a potential epigenetic adjuvant to overcome cisplatin resistance in BC.",cisplatin resist remain major challeng clinic treatment bladder cancer bc epigenet regul resist particularli involv 5hydroxymethylcytosin 5hmc fulli elucid investig role 5hmc vitamin c vc modul cisplatin sensit bc clinic analys 36 bc patient receiv cisplatinbas neoadjuv chemotherapi show reduc 5hmc level prechemotherapi tumor tissu significantli associ cisplatin resist crbc poor prognosi low 5hmc correl shorter progressionfre surviv pf vitro establish two cisplatinresist cell line t24cr umuc3cr exhibit reduc 5hmc compar parent cell treatment 100 mum vc significantli restor 5hmc level crbc cell activ tet enzym inhibit cell prolifer enhanc cisplatin sensit effect abrog tet inhibitor bobcat339 confirm vc act tetdepend manner mechanist genomewid 850 k methyl array rnaseq analys reveal vc upregul methyl specif promot atf4 downstream effector mapk pathway therebi downregul atf4 express atf4 knockdown crbc cell increas cisplatin sensit bobcat339 revers vcinduc atf4 downregul vivo vc combin cisplatin significantli inhibit tumor growth t24cr xenograft cotreat atf4 knockdown enhanc effect accompani elev 5hmc reduc ki67 tumor collect find identifi reduc 5hmc hallmark cisplatinresist bc reveal novel mechan vc enhanc cisplatin sensit vc activ tet enzym increas 5mc atf4 promot downregul atf4 modul mapk pathway highlight vc potenti epigenet adjuv overcom cisplatin resist bc
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer reduces quality of life. Hr-QoL after all types of surgeries in general and after elective breast surgeries like mastectomy in particular is, however an under-researched area worldwide. This gap is conspicuously felt and seen especially in developing countries like Ethiopia. The main objective of this study was to assess the Hr-QoL outcomes of breast cancer cases after curative-intent surgery in comparison with health institution-based normal individuals. METHODS AND PATIENTS: A comparative cross-sectional study using SF-36 was conducted to compare Hr-QoL outcomes of representatively sampled 366 post-mastectomy women and health institution-based women as controls. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS windows version 21. The mean ranks of the Hr-QoL outcomes on a 0 to 100 scale were compared between the two groups using Mann-Whitney U test at p-value </= 0.05 (two-sided). RESULTS: Three hundred sixty-six participants (366), 183 cases and 183 controls were included in the analysis. Post-mastectomy cases had a median Physical Functioning (PF) of 70.0; Role-Physical (RP) of 75.0; Bodily Pain (BP) of 44.0; General Health (GH) of 35.0; Vitality (VT) of 40.0; Social Functioning (SF) of 50.0; Role-Emotional (RE) of 33.3; and Mental Health (MH) of 44.0. The respective values for the control group were: 75.0; 75.0; 54.0; 50.0; 55.0; 62.5; 66.7; and 64.0. PF and RP showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups. On the other hand, BP, GH, VT, SF, RE and MH were significantly lower in the post-mastectomy group. CONCLUSION: Quality of life of breast cancer patients after a curative-intent mastectomy was found to be lower. They had significantly lower scores in scales measuring mental health and those measuring both physical and mental health. Of the three scales assessing physical health, bodily pain was significantly lower.",background breast cancer reduc qualiti life hrqol type surgeri gener elect breast surgeri like mastectomi particular howev underresearch area worldwid gap conspicu felt seen especi develop countri like ethiopia main object studi assess hrqol outcom breast cancer case curativeint surgeri comparison health institutionbas normal individu method patient compar crosssect studi use sf36 conduct compar hrqol outcom repres sampl 366 postmastectomi women health institutionbas women control collect data analyz use spss window version 21 mean rank hrqol outcom 0 100 scale compar two group use mannwhitney u test pvalu 005 twosid result three hundr sixtysix particip 366 183 case 183 control includ analysi postmastectomi case median physic function pf 700 rolephys rp 750 bodili pain bp 440 gener health gh 350 vital vt 400 social function sf 500 roleemot 333 mental health mh 440 respect valu control group 750 750 540 500 550 625 667 640 pf rp show statist signific differ two group hand bp gh vt sf mh significantli lower postmastectomi group conclus qualiti life breast cancer patient curativeint mastectomi found lower significantli lower score scale measur mental health measur physic mental health three scale assess physic health bodili pain significantli lower
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Colectomy for colon cancer typically results in gastrointestinal hypomotility. Daikenchuto, a herbal medicine traditionally used in Japan, is administered to alleviate gastrointestinal hypomotility. However, it is suspected to cause hepatobiliary injury. Therefore, in this comparative, retrospective cohort study, we aimed to assess the risk of daikenchuto administration-induced hepatobiliary injury post-colectomy. METHODS: Patients with colon cancer who underwent colectomy, excluding the population with a high risk of postoperative hepatobiliary injury, were included in this study (N = 17,996). Specifically, patients who received daikenchuto within 4 days after colectomy or from the day of surgery to the first meal postoperatively and those who did not receive daikenchuto were assigned to the daikenchuto exposure and non-exposure groups, respectively. The primary outcome was the postoperative administration of cholagogues or hepatoprotective drugs. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed considering the perioperative risk factors for hepatobiliary injury. The analysis estimated the adjusted odds ratios to assess the risk of daikenchuto-induced hepatobiliary injury. RESULTS: The frequencies of the postoperative administration of cholagogues or hepatoprotective drugs were 52 of 2,324 patients (2.24%) and 421 of 15,672 (2.69%) in the daikenchuto exposure and non-exposure groups, respectively. Furthermore, the adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (0.62-1.12) were < 1 and included 1, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: No association between daikenchuto and the risk of hepatobiliary injury was identified. Thus, our results imply that daikenchuto can be safely administered post-colectomy.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer (CC) is a public health burden, particularly in low-and middle-income countries, but can be prevented by screening for Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Nevertheless, positive test results may have psychological and sexual impacts for women. This study aimed to assess the impact of HPV test results on anxiety and sexual dysfunction in Cameroonian women. METHODS: This prospective cohort study conducted from 2020 to 2022 in Cameroon, included women previously enrolled in the 3T-Approach trial. Participants underwent a same-day consultation, organized as follows: HPV screening, triage of HPV-positive women and treatment by thermal ablation or Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone (LLETZ), if necessary. They completed anxiety (STAI) and sexual function (ASEX) questionnaires at 1, 6, and 12 months post-screening. RESULTS: Among 273 women included in the study, 220 (80.6%) completed all time points. Upon inclusion, 24.5% were HPV-positive, of which 46.3% underwent treatment. Anxiety levels did not significantly differ by HPV status. Higher sexual dysfunction prevalence was observed in HPV-positive women at all intervals. Between 1 and 12 months HPV-positive women showed an increase in their mean sexual dysfunction score (+ 4.5, 95% CI: 0.5 to 8.4), which was not seen in HPV-negative women. This disparity persisted even after adjusting for socio-demographic factors. CONCLUSION: HPV test results did not significantly impact anxiety levels in women in Cameroon. Nevertheless, HPV-positive women reported higher sexual dysfunction at one-year post-screening compared to HPV-negative women. Further research should focus on investigating the factors affecting sexual dysfunction, in order to propose strategies to maintain women's well-being without compromising screening rates.

cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of Mepitel film on the prevention and treatment of radiodermatitis. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search across multiple databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, and SinoMed Database, from their inception until August 6, 2024. We identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials that assessed the effects of Mepitel film on radiodermatitis. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool for randomized trials (RoB2). Traditional meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 and Stata 14.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies involving 2,313 cancer patients were included. The pooled analysis indicated that Mepitel significantly reduced the incidence of radiation dermatitis (OR = 0.28, 95%CI 0.16 to 0.50, I(2) = 67%, P < 0.0001) compared to the control groups. In the subgroup analysis by cancer type, Mepitel reduced the incidence of radiation dermatitis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (OR = 0.25, 95%CI 0.13 to 0.46, I(2) = 0%, P < 0.0001), breast cancer (OR = 0.42, 95%CI 0.26 to 0.68, I(2) = 24%, P = 0.0004), and various malignancies (OR = 0.10, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.16, I(2) = 0%, P < 0.00001). Mepitel use was also associated with a lower incidence of moderate and severe skin injury in radiotherapy patients (RTOG grade II OR = 0.26, 95%CI 0.16 to 0.42, P < 0.00001; RTOG grade III OR = 0.19, 95%CI 0.12 to 0.30, P < 0.00001; RTOG grade IV OR = 0.10, 95%CI 0.03 to 0.36, P = 0.0005), as well as a reduction in the severity of radiation-induced skin damage (combined RISRAS score, MD= -0.74 95% CI -1.02 to -0.46, I(2) = 95%, P < 0.00001; researcher RISRAS score MD= -0.47 95% CI -0.67 to -0.27, I(2) = 90%, P < 0.00001; and patient RISRAS score MD= -1.19 95% CI -1.33 to -1.05, I(2) = 39%, P < 0.00001). Additionally, patients treated with Mepitel experienced fewer cases of moist desquamation (OR = 0.46, 95%CI 0.25 to 0.83, I(2) = 58%, P = 0.010), and shorter healing times (MD= -4.73, 95%CI -7.16 to -2.30, I(2) = 98%, P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Mepitel interventions significantly reduced RTOG grades and RISRAS scores, decreased the risk of moist desquamation, and shortened healing times for radiation-induced dermatitis in cancer patients. Further clinical studies are needed to better understand the relationship between Mepitel and radiation dermatitis in this patient population.",object evalu effect mepitel film prevent treatment radiodermat method conduct systemat search across multipl databas includ pubm cochran librari embas china nation knowledg infrastructur cnki wanfang databas sinom databas incept august 6 2024 identifi random control trial rct control clinic trial assess effect mepitel film radiodermat risk bia evalu use revis cochran riskofbia tool random trial rob2 tradit metaanalysi perform use revman 53 stata 140 softwar result total 27 studi involv 2313 cancer patient includ pool analysi indic mepitel significantli reduc incid radiat dermat 028 95ci 016 050 i2 67 p 00001 compar control group subgroup analysi cancer type mepitel reduc incid radiat dermat nasopharyng carcinoma 025 95ci 013 046 i2 0 p 00001 breast cancer 042 95ci 026 068 i2 24 p 00004 variou malign 010 95ci 006 016 i2 0 p 000001 mepitel use also associ lower incid moder sever skin injuri radiotherapi patient rtog grade ii 026 95ci 016 042 p 000001 rtog grade iii 019 95ci 012 030 p 000001 rtog grade iv 010 95ci 003 036 p 00005 well reduct sever radiationinduc skin damag combin risra score md 074 95 ci 102 046 i2 95 p 000001 research risra score md 047 95 ci 067 027 i2 90 p 000001 patient risra score md 119 95 ci 133 105 i2 39 p 000001 addit patient treat mepitel experienc fewer case moist desquam 046 95ci 025 083 i2 58 p 0010 shorter heal time md 473 95ci 716 230 i2 98 p 00001 conclus mepitel intervent significantli reduc rtog grade risra score decreas risk moist desquam shorten heal time radiationinduc dermat cancer patient clinic studi need better understand relationship mepitel radiat dermat patient popul
cancer,"BACKGROUND: The prognostic significance of sarcopenia estimated by serum creatinine and cystatin C in cancer patients remained inconsistent. The purpose of the meta-analysis was to comprehensively evaluate the association between creatinine/cystatin C ratio(CCR) or sarcopenia index(SI) and survival outcomes in cancer patients with sarcopenia. METHODS: A comprehensive search of relevant studies was implemented by scrutinizing Pubmed, Web of science and Embase databases until June 30, 2024. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the survival outcomes. RESULTS: 18 studies from 17 articles involving 9908 patients were enrolled in the study. The meta-analysis indicated that low CCR was significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS) (HR:1.71,95% CI: 1.42-2.06), progression free survival (PFS)((HR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.33-2.34), recurrence free survival (RFS)(HR: 2.48; 95% CI: 1.52-4.05). Low SI was correlated with poor OS (HR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.21-2.13). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that low CCR was an adverse prognostic marker not affected by cancer type, treatment method, country and analysis type.

cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To establish a model integrates clinical, traditional radiologic, intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics (ITR and PTR), and intratumoral and peritumoral heterogeneity (ITH and PTH) features to diagnose lymphovascular invasion (LVI) status for early stage non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data and chest CT imaging data of NSCLC patients who underwent surgical resection of the lungs from January 2019 to May 2021 were collected. Surgical pathology were the diagnostic gold standard to clarify the LVI status. ITR and PTR features and ITH and PTH features from the total tumor volume and peritumoral tumor volume were extracted. Then clinical, traditional radiologic, ITR and PTR, ITH and PTH models were established to diagnose LVI status. Finally, a column chart diagnostic model was constructed and the diagnostic efficacy was evaluated. RESULTS: 366 NSCLC patients were enrolled in this retrospective study from 2 institutions, in which Institution 1 served as the basis for training (n = 154) and internal validation (n = 154) sets, while Institution 2 served as the external validation set (n = 58). In the three cohorts of PTR_(0-3, -3-3 and 0-6), the PTR_0-6 model has better predictive performance, with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.882 and 0.824 for the training and validation groups, respectively. Gender, Vascular Convergence Sign, and N stage were significantly related to LVI status, Finally, the combined model integrated ITH, PTR_0-6, and PTH_0-6 models, N stage and Vascular Convergence Sign has the highest diagnostic accuracy. The AUCs for training set, internal validation set, and external validation set were 0.963, 0.882, and 0.743, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive diagnostic model based on clinical features, traditional radiological features, radiomic features, and heterogeneity features of NSCLC were established to diagnose LVI for early stage NSCLC, which has the highest diagnostic efficiency and can help to guide treatment decisions.

cancer,"The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) is a component of a ubiquitin ligase complex that controls cellular responses to hypoxia. Endogenous VHL is also utilized by proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) protein degraders, a promising class of anti-cancer agents. VHL is broadly essential for cell proliferation, yet it is a key tumor suppressor in renal cell carcinoma. To understand the functional consequences of VHL loss, and to identify targeted approaches for the elimination of VHL null cells, we have used genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening in human renal epithelial cells. We find that, upon VHL loss, the HIF1A/ARNT complex is the central inhibitor of cellular fitness, suppressing mitochondrial respiration, and that VHL null cells show HIF1A-dependent molecular vulnerabilities that can be targeted pharmacologically. Combined VHL/HIF1A inactivation in breast and esophageal cancer cells can also provide resistance to ARV-771, a VHL-based bromodomain degrader that has anti-cancer activity. HIF1A stabilization can thus provide opportunities for early intervention in neoplastic VHL clones, and the VHL-HIF1A axis may be relevant for the development of resistance to the emerging class of PROTAC-based cancer therapies.",von hippellindau tumor suppressor vhl compon ubiquitin ligas complex control cellular respons hypoxia endogen vhl also util proteolysistarget chimera protac protein degrad promis class anticanc agent vhl broadli essenti cell prolifer yet key tumor suppressor renal cell carcinoma understand function consequ vhl loss identifi target approach elimin vhl null cell use genomewid crisprcas9 screen human renal epitheli cell find upon vhl loss hif1aarnt complex central inhibitor cellular fit suppress mitochondri respir vhl null cell show hif1adepend molecular vulner target pharmacolog combin vhlhif1a inactiv breast esophag cancer cell also provid resist arv771 vhlbase bromodomain degrad anticanc activ hif1a stabil thu provid opportun earli intervent neoplast vhl clone vhlhif1a axi may relev develop resist emerg class protacbas cancer therapi
cancer,"The recent discovery of cell death mediated by metal ions has aroused significant interest in harnessing this novel mechanism of cell death for cancer therapy. As the two identified metal ion-based regulated cell death forms, ferroptosis and cuproptosis were initially studied separately, while increasing evidences underscored their intricate connections. Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most severe malignant tumors of the digestive system. Targeting the complex interplay between ferroptosis and cuproptosis, and understanding their intrinsic mechanisms may offer approaches for developing innovative therapies in GC. Here, we identified that metal-regulatory transcription factor 1 (MTF1) was the key gene blocking the sensitivity of ferroptosis and cuproptosis enhanced by the combination treatment with FINO2 and ES-Cu in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MTF1 suppressed FINO2/ES-Cu induced ferroptosis through upregulating FTH1 to reduce Fe(2+) levels. In addition to direct transcriptional upregulation of FTH1, MTF1 activated TRIM31. Subsequently, TRIM31 catalyzed ubiquitination of NCOA4 and also promoted the expression of FTH1. On the other hand, it also activated iron-sulfur cluster assembly 2 (ISCA2)-mediated iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly and iron starvation response to inhibit cuproptosis and ferroptosis. Collectively, our findings indicated the mechanism of the synergistic effect of ferroptosis and cuproptosis in the treatment of GC and presented a prospective therapeutic strategy through elucidating the molecular mechanism of ferroptosis and cuproptosis mediated by MTF1.",recent discoveri cell death mediat metal ion arous signific interest har novel mechan cell death cancer therapi two identifi metal ionbas regul cell death form ferroptosi cuproptosi initi studi separ increas evid underscor intric connect gastric cancer gc one sever malign tumor digest system target complex interplay ferroptosi cuproptosi understand intrins mechan may offer approach develop innov therapi gc identifi metalregulatori transcript factor 1 mtf1 key gene block sensit ferroptosi cuproptosi enhanc combin treatment fino2 escu vitro vivo mechanist mtf1 suppress fino2escu induc ferroptosi upregul fth1 reduc fe2 level addit direct transcript upregul fth1 mtf1 activ trim31 subsequ trim31 catalyz ubiquitin ncoa4 also promot express fth1 hand also activ ironsulfur cluster assembl 2 isca2medi ironsulfur cluster isc assembl iron starvat respons inhibit cuproptosi ferroptosi collect find indic mechan synergist effect ferroptosi cuproptosi treatment gc present prospect therapeut strategi elucid molecular mechan ferroptosi cuproptosi mediat mtf1
cancer,"Cell migration is a cornerstone of biological systems, enabling organisms to adapt to environmental stimuli and maintain homeostasis. Disruptions in this process can lead to functional impairment or system failure. In many cases, cells do not move randomly; instead, they migrate directionally in response to external cues, allowing them to perform essential biological functions. This directed movement is especially important in processes such as morphogenesis, cancer invasion, and wound healing. To unravel the complexities of directional cell migration, investigating natural guiding stimuli is crucial. Among these, electrical fields stand out as precise and physiologically relevant stimulus. Using a platform designed to apply programmable electric fields, the SCHEEPDOG device, we applied controlled electric field of varying intensities to keratocytes and quantitatively analyzed their migratory behavior. Our findings reveal that electric field stimulation not only induces robust directional migration but also enhances migration speed in an intensity-dependent manner. Additionally, cells initially moving in random directions gradually align with the field vector, with higher intensities accelerating the alignment. Intriguingly, while both speed and alignment time can be modulated through stimulation, the overall shape of migration trajectories remains unchanged. In other terms, for cells initially moving to the opposite direction of the field, the alignment is accompanied by making a turn and the size and shape of this turn are not affected by the magnitude of the electrical stimulation. Together, these results demonstrate that electrical stimulation can tune the speed and directional alignment of keratocyte migration without altering turning dynamics. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of electrotaxis and offers new insights into how biophysical cues regulate cell migration in both physiological and pathological contexts.",cell migrat cornerston biolog system enabl organ adapt environment stimuli maintain homeostasi disrupt process lead function impair system failur mani case cell move randomli instead migrat direct respons extern cue allow perform essenti biolog function direct movement especi import process morphogenesi cancer invas wound heal unravel complex direct cell migrat investig natur guid stimuli crucial among electr field stand precis physiolog relev stimulu use platform design appli programm electr field scheepdog devic appli control electr field vari intens keratocyt quantit analyz migratori behavior find reveal electr field stimul induc robust direct migrat also enhanc migrat speed intensitydepend manner addit cell initi move random direct gradual align field vector higher intens acceler align intriguingli speed align time modul stimul overal shape migrat trajectori remain unchang term cell initi move opposit direct field align accompani make turn size shape turn affect magnitud electr stimul togeth result demonstr electr stimul tune speed direct align keratocyt migrat without alter turn dynam find contribut deeper understand electrotaxi offer new insight biophys cue regul cell migrat physiolog patholog context
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large group of anthropogenic chemicals that have been widely used in industrial manufacturing for decades. Due to their persistence in both the biotic and abiotic environment over many years, PFAS are also referred to as ""forever chemicals."" Some PFAS exhibit toxic properties and can harm both the environment and human health. OBJECTIVE: To describe the chemical properties, adverse health effects, and main exposure sources of PFAS, with a particular focus on the skin and inflammatory skin diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An unrestricted literature search was conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar to prepare a narrative review. The search terms included the following: atopic dermatitis, cutaneous, forever chemicals, PFAS, PFOA, psoriasis, skin, skin cancer, skin disease. RESULTS: Human skin exposure to PFAS occurs either through direct contact with contaminated cosmetics, personal care products, and textiles, or indirectly through the redistribution of systemically absorbed PFAS. Depending on the specific PFAS compound, as well as the duration and level of exposure, these substances can suppress cutaneous immune responses, induce oxidative stress, and trigger proinflammatory tissue reactions. Epidemiological studies have shown an association between PFAS exposure and atopic dermatitis, particularly among female study participants. CONCLUSION: The currently available epidemiological and experimental evidence regarding the effects of PFAS on skin health remains limited in scope and strength. Given the near-ubiquitous presence of PFAS in the environment, further research is urgently needed to better understand the associated risks to the skin and to develop targeted preventive strategies.",background per polyfluoroalkyl substanc pfa larg group anthropogen chemic wide use industri manufactur decad due persist biotic abiot environ mani year pfa also refer forev chemic pfa exhibit toxic properti harm environ human health object describ chemic properti advers health effect main exposur sourc pfa particular focu skin inflammatori skin diseas materi method unrestrict literatur search conduct pubm googl scholar prepar narr review search term includ follow atop dermat cutan forev chemic pfa pfoa psoriasi skin skin cancer skin diseas result human skin exposur pfa occur either direct contact contamin cosmet person care product textil indirectli redistribut system absorb pfa depend specif pfa compound well durat level exposur substanc suppress cutan immun respons induc oxid stress trigger proinflammatori tissu reaction epidemiolog studi shown associ pfa exposur atop dermat particularli among femal studi particip conclus current avail epidemiolog experiment evid regard effect pfa skin health remain limit scope strength given nearubiquit presenc pfa environ research urgent need better understand associ risk skin develop target prevent strategi
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are pivotal stromal components in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), influencing tumor progression, metastasis, and immunotherapy resistance. However, a comprehensive bibliometric overview of CAFs in HCC is lacking. METHODS: A systematic search of the Web of Science Core Collection from January 1, 2004, to June 15, 2025 yielded 646 eligible publications. Bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer and CiteSpace mapped publication trends, international collaboration, institutional contributions, author networks, journal impact, and research hotspots. RESULTS: A total of 646 articles were analyzed, spanning 282 journals and 2684 keywords. From 2004 to June 15, 2025, there was a significant increase in publications. China led in publication numbers, followed by the US and Japan. Renowned institutions include Sun Yat Sen University, Fudan University, and Zhejiang University. Notable researchers are Fan Jia, Giannelli Gianluigi, and Zhou Jian. The journal with the highest publication and citation frequency is Cancer Research. The main research focuses are the effects of CAFs on HCC cell proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis, immunosuppression, and drug resistance, as well as the mechanisms of CAFs in HCC immunotherapy and the progress in targeted CAF research. CONCLUSION: CAFs research in HCC has transitioned from descriptive studies to precision therapeutic targeting. Future directions involve dissecting CAFs plasticity, leveraging single-cell multiomics, and optimizing combination therapies to overcome TME-mediated resistance.",background cancerassoci fibroblast caf pivot stromal compon tumor microenviron tme hepatocellular carcinoma hcc influenc tumor progress metastasi immunotherapi resist howev comprehens bibliometr overview caf hcc lack method systemat search web scienc core collect januari 1 2004 june 15 2025 yield 646 elig public bibliometr analysi use vosview citespac map public trend intern collabor institut contribut author network journal impact research hotspot result total 646 articl analyz span 282 journal 2684 keyword 2004 june 15 2025 signific increas public china led public number follow us japan renown institut includ sun yat sen univers fudan univers zhejiang univers notabl research fan jia giannelli gianluigi zhou jian journal highest public citat frequenc cancer research main research focus effect caf hcc cell prolifer angiogenesi invas metastasi immunosuppress drug resist well mechan caf hcc immunotherapi progress target caf research conclus caf research hcc transit descript studi precis therapeut target futur direct involv dissect caf plastic leverag singlecel multiom optim combin therapi overcom tmemedi resist
cancer,"FLIM (Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy) is a powerful technique used to study protein-protein interactions, enzyme kinetics dynamics, and cellular metabolism. It is also used in studying diseases like cancer, where changes in fluorescence lifetimes can indicate alterations in cellular physiology of malignancies. Recently, FLIM technology in fluorescence guidance has been applied in receptor-targeted clinical applications. Here, we propose the application of FLIM in two animal models of esophageal adenocarcinoma, xenograft and orthotopic with a HER-2 targeting probe (Nanofitin-IRDye800CW, NF-800 hereafter) previously developed. Moreover, the technique was used to further investigate the determinants of lifetime during probe-receptor interactions. The presented data indicates that FLIM is a powerful technique and, when coupled with NF-800, it could enhance tumor contrast, leading to new clinical applications in fluorescence guided surgery.",flim fluoresc lifetim imag microscopi power techniqu use studi proteinprotein interact enzym kinet dynam cellular metabol also use studi diseas like cancer chang fluoresc lifetim indic alter cellular physiolog malign recent flim technolog fluoresc guidanc appli receptortarget clinic applic propos applic flim two anim model esophag adenocarcinoma xenograft orthotop her2 target probe nanofitinirdye800cw nf800 hereaft previous develop moreov techniqu use investig determin lifetim probereceptor interact present data indic flim power techniqu coupl nf800 could enhanc tumor contrast lead new clinic applic fluoresc guid surgeri
cancer,"BACKGROUND: A previously conducted study reported that insomnia rates among oncology patients in Ireland are twice that of the general population, and that a breast cancer diagnosis was an independent predictor for clinical insomnia disorder. The aim of this study is to explore this interaction further in a larger cohort of breast cancer patients. METHODS: We evaluated sleep disturbance and sleep hygiene practices among adult breast cancer patients via questionnaires. Sociodemographic data, clinical characteristics, sleep history and attitudes towards sleep assessments were collected and analysed. RESULTS: The comprehensive 40-item questionnaire was completed by 315 patients. Of this cohort, 56% reported a change in their sleeping patterns since their cancer diagnosis, with over 55% of the study population having sub-threshold or clinical insomnia disorder. Although 64.2% of patients believed that questions regarding sleep should be part of breast cancer assessment, only 32% recalled being asked about sleep by a healthcare worker. Moreover, only 27.1% of respondents felt their sleeping difficulties were adequately dealt with since their diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In summary, sleep disturbance is prevalent among breast cancer patients. Despite a majority of breast cancer patients recognising the importance of sleep assessment, a significant gap remains in healthcare providers addressing these concerns effectively.",background previous conduct studi report insomnia rate among oncolog patient ireland twice gener popul breast cancer diagnosi independ predictor clinic insomnia disord aim studi explor interact larger cohort breast cancer patient method evalu sleep disturb sleep hygien practic among adult breast cancer patient via questionnair sociodemograph data clinic characterist sleep histori attitud toward sleep assess collect analys result comprehens 40item questionnair complet 315 patient cohort 56 report chang sleep pattern sinc cancer diagnosi 55 studi popul subthreshold clinic insomnia disord although 642 patient believ question regard sleep part breast cancer assess 32 recal ask sleep healthcar worker moreov 271 respond felt sleep difficulti adequ dealt sinc diagnosi conclus summari sleep disturb preval among breast cancer patient despit major breast cancer patient recognis import sleep assess signific gap remain healthcar provid address concern effect
cancer,"Cervical cancer (CC), a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide, is primarily driven by high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and comprises two major histological subtypes: adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Despite advances in prevention and treatment, the molecular and cellular heterogeneity of these subtypes poses significant challenges to achieving optimal clinical outcomes. Here, we integrate single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) to dissect the cellular and spatial heterogeneity of AC and SCC, uncovering distinct tumor microenvironment (TME) dynamics that underlie their divergent clinical behaviors. Our scRNA-seq analysis reveals that AC is enriched in epithelial cells, while SCC exhibits a more immunogenic TME with elevated plasma cells and NK/T cells. Spatial transcriptomics further highlights robust interactions between CD8 + T cells and epithelial subtypes in SCC, contrasting with the stromal-rich, immune-cold phenotype of AC. We identify subtype-specific immune and stromal features, including ICOS+ Tregs, IDO1+ cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and PLVAP+ endothelial cells, which may drive immune evasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding CC heterogeneity and offer actionable insights for developing subtype-specific therapeutic strategies, such as combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with stromal-targeting agents. This study underscores the potential of spatial multi-omics technologies to advance precision oncology and improve outcomes for cervical cancer patients.",cervic cancer cc lead caus cancerrel death among women worldwid primarili driven highrisk human papillomaviru hpv infect compris two major histolog subtyp adenocarcinoma ac squamou cell carcinoma scc despit advanc prevent treatment molecular cellular heterogen subtyp pose signific challeng achiev optim clinic outcom integr singlecel rna sequenc scrnaseq spatial transcriptom st dissect cellular spatial heterogen ac scc uncov distinct tumor microenviron tme dynam underli diverg clinic behavior scrnaseq analysi reveal ac enrich epitheli cell scc exhibit immunogen tme elev plasma cell nkt cell spatial transcriptom highlight robust interact cd8 cell epitheli subtyp scc contrast stromalrich immunecold phenotyp ac identifi subtypespecif immun stromal featur includ ico treg ido1 cancerassoci fibroblast caf plvap endotheli cell may drive immun evas angiogenesi metastasi find provid comprehens framework understand cc heterogen offer action insight develop subtypespecif therapeut strategi combin immun checkpoint inhibitor stromaltarget agent studi underscor potenti spatial multiom technolog advanc precis oncolog improv outcom cervic cancer patient
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance (IR) is increasingly recognized as a significant factor for cancer development and progression. While the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index and its derivatives (TyG-BMI (body mass index), TyG-WC (waist circumference), and TyG-WHtR (waist-to-height ratio)) have been developed as reliable and straightforward surrogate tools for reflecting IR status, their comparative associations with pan-cancer incidence and mortality remain unclear. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the associations of these four IR-related indices with pan-cancer incidence and cancer-specific mortality in a large prospective cohort. METHODS: This prospective cohort study analyzed data from 333,297 participants in the UK Biobank. The four IR-related indices mentioned above were calculated from baseline measurements. The primary outcomes were pan-cancer incidence and pan-cancer-specific mortality. Cox regression models, adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and clinical factors, were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) across participants' quartiles for each index. Besides, we assessed Dose-response relationships via restricted cubic splines (RCSs), and robustness via sensitivity and subgroup analyses. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 15.2 years, 49,695 cases of different types of cancer and 12,852 cancer-specific deaths were recorded. All four IR-related indices showed significant non-linear associations with both outcomes (p < 0.001). After full adjustment, TyG-WC demonstrated the strongest and most graded association with pan-cancer incidence, with HRs progressively increasing from Q2 to Q4 (all p < 0.05 vs. Q1), and HR of Q4 was 1.11 (95% CI (confidence interval): 1.08, 1.15, p = 0.001). For pan-cancer-specific mortality, TyG-WC (HR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.28, 1.46; p < 0.001), TyG-WHtR (HR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.18, 1.33; p < 0.001), and TyG-BMI (HR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.15,1.29; p < 0.001) were significantly elevated in Q4, with TyG-WC again showing a significant dose-response trend across all quartiles. In contrast, the original TyG index showed the weakest predictive performance. Subgroup analyses indicated effect modifications by sex, smoking status, and comorbidities. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the associations, particularly for TyG-WC. CONCLUSION: IR-related indices, especially TyG-WC, are significantly associated with both pan-cancer incidence and cancer-specific mortality. Compared with TyG, TyG-BMI, and TyG-WHtR, TyG-WC demonstrated stronger associations, suggesting its potential utility for stratifying cancer risk and prognosis in clinical and public health settings.",background insulin resist ir increasingli recogn signific factor cancer develop progress triglycerideglucos tyg index deriv tygbmi bodi mass index tygwc waist circumfer tygwhtr waisttoheight ratio develop reliabl straightforward surrog tool reflect ir statu compar associ pancanc incid mortal remain unclear studi aim systemat evalu associ four irrel indic pancanc incid cancerspecif mortal larg prospect cohort method prospect cohort studi analyz data 333297 particip uk biobank four irrel indic mention calcul baselin measur primari outcom pancanc incid pancancerspecif mortal cox regress model adjust demograph socioeconom lifestyl clinic factor use estim hazard ratio hr across particip quartil index besid assess doserespons relationship via restrict cubic spline rcss robust via sensit subgroup analys result median followup 152 year 49695 case differ type cancer 12852 cancerspecif death record four irrel indic show signific nonlinear associ outcom p 0001 full adjust tygwc demonstr strongest grade associ pancanc incid hr progress increas q2 q4 p 005 vs q1 hr q4 111 95 ci confid interv 108 115 p 0001 pancancerspecif mortal tygwc hr 137 95 ci 128 146 p 0001 tygwhtr hr 125 95 ci 118 133 p 0001 tygbmi hr 122 95 ci 115129 p 0001 significantli elev q4 tygwc show signific doserespons trend across quartil contrast origin tyg index show weakest predict perform subgroup analys indic effect modif sex smoke statu comorbid sensit analys confirm robust associ particularli tygwc conclus irrel indic especi tygwc significantli associ pancanc incid cancerspecif mortal compar tyg tygbmi tygwhtr tygwc demonstr stronger associ suggest potenti util stratifi cancer risk prognosi clinic public health set
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) induced by interferons play a crucial role in inflammatory signaling. This study aimed to investigate their anti-cancer properties in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). METHOD: Seven GBPs genes were obtained from the TCGA-LUAD and GSE31210 datasets. The GBPs score was computed for each patient using ssGSEA, followed by conducting WGCNA. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with the Limma package, and further refined by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses to develop a risk score model. Kaplan-Meier survival and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed with the survminer and timeROC packages, respectively. Immune microenvironment was profiled using ESTIMATE and ssGSEA algorithms, while the pRRophetic package was applied to predict chemotherapeutic sensitivity. Relevant signaling pathways were identified by GSEA. Finally, the functional roles of key genes were experimentally validated using CCK-8, wound healing, and Transwell assays. RESULTS: The GBPs score was significantly higher in para-carcinoma tissues. The green-yellow module (beta = 7), which contained 422 genes, was closely associated with the GBPs score. Intersection of this module with the DEGs yielded 92 overlapping candidates. A 4-gene risk model constructed from Cox regression demonstrated high predictive accuracy for 1-, 3-, and 5 year Overall Survival. Patients were assigned by the median risk score into low- and high-risk groups, with low-risk patients showing better prognostic outcomes and higher immune infiltration scores, particularly of CD4(+) T cells and activated B cells. A nomogram combining multiple clinical factors exhibited robust prognostic performance. We also further identified potential drugs for treating different risk groups of LUAD. Pathways such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Myc target V2 were enriched in high-risk groups, suggesting potential targets for immunotherapy. In vitro assays confirmed that knockdown of the model gene CBFA2T3 significantly suppressed the migratory and invasive capacities of A549 and NCI-H838 cells. CONCLUSION: We analyzed the GBPs phenotype associated with LUAD progression and developed a risk score model for patient prognosis. This finding provided a reference model for clinically assessing patient prognosis, contributing to personalized treatment for LUAD patients.",background guanylatebind protein gbp induc interferon play crucial role inflammatori signal studi aim investig anticanc properti lung adenocarcinoma luad method seven gbp gene obtain tcgaluad gse31210 dataset gbp score comput patient use ssgsea follow conduct wgcna differenti express gene deg identifi limma packag refin univari multivari cox regress analys develop risk score model kaplanmei surviv timedepend receiv oper characterist roc analys perform survmin timeroc packag respect immun microenviron profil use estim ssgsea algorithm prrophet packag appli predict chemotherapeut sensit relev signal pathway identifi gsea final function role key gene experiment valid use cck8 wound heal transwel assay result gbp score significantli higher paracarcinoma tissu greenyellow modul beta 7 contain 422 gene close associ gbp score intersect modul deg yield 92 overlap candid 4gene risk model construct cox regress demonstr high predict accuraci 1 3 5 year overal surviv patient assign median risk score low highrisk group lowrisk patient show better prognost outcom higher immun infiltr score particularli cd4 cell activ b cell nomogram combin multipl clinic factor exhibit robust prognost perform also identifi potenti drug treat differ risk group luad pathway reactiv oxygen speci ro myc target v2 enrich highrisk group suggest potenti target immunotherapi vitro assay confirm knockdown model gene cbfa2t3 significantli suppress migratori invas capac a549 ncih838 cell conclus analyz gbp phenotyp associ luad progress develop risk score model patient prognosi find provid refer model clinic assess patient prognosi contribut person treatment luad patient
cancer,"BACKGROUND: To optimize prehabilitation for patients with oesophageal cancer, insight is required into the response to prehabilitation, and factors affecting this response. This study investigated (1) the response to prehabilitation in patients with oesophageal cancer following neoadjuvant treatment, (2) the association between baseline physical fitness and preoperative changes in fitness, (3) differences in physical fitness, nutritional status, and fatigue between responders and non-responders to prehabilitation. METHODS: This multicenter cohort study included patients with oesophageal cancer, following a 6-10 week personalized prehabilitation program as part of standard care. Prehabilitation, consisting of supervised exercise and nutritional counseling, started after neoadjuvant treatment. Preoperative physical fitness and nutritional status were monitored before and after neoadjuvant treatment, and after prehabilitation. Changes over time were analyzed using linear mixed models. Impact of baseline fitness on preoperative changes in exercise capacity was investigated using a linear mixed regression model. Differences between responders to prehabilitation (> 0 Watt improvement during exercise training) and non-responders were analyzed using Independent T-Tests and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Two hundred forty patients were included (mean age 66.0 (9.3) years; 77.1% male). On average, physical fitness and nutritional status declined during neoadjuvant treatment, and significantly improved during prehabilitation. Exercise capacity increased by + 32.7 Watts (95% CI: 25.2-40.2) during prehabilitation, with similar improvements across patients with low, moderate, and high baseline capacity. Substantial heterogeneity in preoperative changes was observed, with only 49.6% of patients following a pattern of decline-improvement (corresponding to average values for exercise capacity). Sixty-five percent of patients were classified as responders. Greater decline in fitness during neoadjuvant treatment (p < .001), lower fitness after neoadjuvant treatment (p = .001), and higher fatigue (p = .01) were associated with a positive response to prehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: On average, patients with oesophageal cancer improved in physical fitness and nutritional status during prehabilitation, recovering from the impact of neoadjuvant treatment.

cancer,"Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), a common oral microorganism linked to periodontal disease, has been recently shown to play a significant role in oral and systemic health through the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Nevertheless, the implications of Porphyromonas gingivalis-derived extracellular vesicles (Pg-EVs) on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) metastasis and the corresponding underlying mechanisms continue to be shrouded in ambiguity. Our study aimed to determine whether and how Pg-EVs mediate ESCC metastasis. Using 16sRNA gene sequencing, FISH and bioinformatics we found that Pg was abundant in human ESCC cancerous tissues and was associated with poor prognosis in ESCC patients. Our results further revealed that Pg-EVs enhanced the migration and invasion of cancer cells, promoted extravasation and metastasis by inducing NFATC2 expression both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we identified that Pg-EVs induced a new pattern recognition receptor PRKACB to activate the JNK pathway, resulting in the upregulation of NFATC2.Interestingly, the abundance of Pg in tumor tissues of EC patients was positively associated with the expression levels of PRKACB and NFATC2. Moreover, high expression of PRKACB or NFATC2 was significantly associated with a shorter overall survival time of EC patients. Our findings suggest that Pg is highly prevalent in ESCC, and it is associated with poor prognosis, stage, and lymph node metastasis. As a consequence of increasing PRKACB expression, Pg-EVs activate the JNK pathway, resulting in an increase in NFATC2 expression.",porphyromona gingivali pg common oral microorgan link periodont diseas recent shown play signific role oral system health secret extracellular vesicl ev nevertheless implic porphyromona gingivalisderiv extracellular vesicl pgev esophag squamou cell carcinoma escc metastasi correspond underli mechan continu shroud ambigu studi aim determin whether pgev mediat escc metastasi use 16srna gene sequenc fish bioinformat found pg abund human escc cancer tissu associ poor prognosi escc patient result reveal pgev enhanc migrat invas cancer cell promot extravas metastasi induc nfatc2 express vitro vivo mechanist identifi pgev induc new pattern recognit receptor prkacb activ jnk pathway result upregul nfatc2interestingli abund pg tumor tissu ec patient posit associ express level prkacb nfatc2 moreov high express prkacb nfatc2 significantli associ shorter overal surviv time ec patient find suggest pg highli preval escc associ poor prognosi stage lymph node metastasi consequ increas prkacb express pgev activ jnk pathway result increas nfatc2 express
cancer,"Investigations on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) events occurring on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are poised to significantly advance nanoliquid biopsy methodologies. This study presented a colorimetric multiplex lateral flow immunoassay strip (mLFIA) for the simultaneous detection of EpCAM and Vimentin, two representative EMT biomarkers, on heterogeneous CTCs. The assay utilized an engineered magnetic probe (pCF-Apt-H1/H2), characterized by a zwitterionic polymer coating on Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles, which conferred anti-fouling properties. This probe also incorporated dual aptamers specific for EpCAM and Vimentin for recognition, along with two complementary strands (H1/H2) that enabled fluorescent detection. Upon recognition, a cascade of strand displacement and entropy-driven amplification reactions was initiated, generating abundant single-stranded DNA co-labeled with biotin and fluorescein, which were subsequently detected by a gold nanoparticle-based mLFIA strip. Coupled with a custom-fabricated 3D-printed reader, the platform facilitated a rapid colorimetric readout for EpCAM and Vimentin, achieving low limits of detection at 0.22 and 0.16 ng/mL, respectively. Remarkably, this assay also demonstrated the capability to detect these two biomarkers on CTCs down to 10 cells/mL, and to track dynamic EMT processes. Machine learning algorithms were subsequently employed to classify and predict the colorimetric signals. Ultimately, this sensing platform proved effective in differentiating healthy individuals from colon cancer patients.",investig epithelialmesenchym transit emt event occur circul tumor cell ctc pois significantli advanc nanoliquid biopsi methodolog studi present colorimetr multiplex later flow immunoassay strip mlfia simultan detect epcam vimentin two repres emt biomark heterogen ctc assay util engin magnet probe pcfapth1h2 character zwitterion polym coat fe3o4 nanoparticl confer antifoul properti probe also incorpor dual aptam specif epcam vimentin recognit along two complementari strand h1h2 enabl fluoresc detect upon recognit cascad strand displac entropydriven amplif reaction initi gener abund singlestrand dna colabel biotin fluorescein subsequ detect gold nanoparticlebas mlfia strip coupl customfabr 3dprint reader platform facilit rapid colorimetr readout epcam vimentin achiev low limit detect 022 016 ngml respect remark assay also demonstr capabl detect two biomark ctc 10 cellsml track dynam emt process machin learn algorithm subsequ employ classifi predict colorimetr signal ultim sens platform prove effect differenti healthi individu colon cancer patient
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulators in cancer progression. Among them, KCNMB2 antisense RNA 1 (KCNMB2-AS1) has been identified as an oncogenic lncRNA in several tumor types; however, its role in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to elucidate the expression profile, functional significance, and underlying molecular mechanisms of KCNMB2-AS1 in ccRCC. METHODS: The expression of KCNMB2-AS1 in ccRCC tissues and cell lines was analyzed using publicly available datasets, quantitative real-time PCR, and Western blotting. Functional assays including Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, wound healing, and Transwell migration/invasion tests along with in vivo xenograft experiments were performed to assess its biological effects. Mechanistic studies, including luciferase reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and rescue assays, were conducted to verify the regulatory interactions among KCNMB2-AS1, forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3), microRNA-744-3p (miR-744-3p), and cluster of differentiation 1D (CD1D). RESULTS: KCNMB2-AS1 expression was markedly elevated in ccRCC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, and its high expression was significantly associated with advanced tumor stage, presence of distant metastasis, and poor overall survival. Silencing KCNMB2-AS1 markedly suppressed ccRCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, accompanied by reduced epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker expression. Consistent with these findings, xenograft experiments confirmed that KCNMB2-AS1 knockdown attenuated tumor growth in vivo, while its overexpression promoted aggressive tumor behavior. Mechanistically, FOXP3 directly bound to the promoter region of KCNMB2-AS1, activating its expression transcriptionally. KCNMB2-AS1 acted as a molecular sponge for miR-744-3p, thereby relieving its inhibitory effect on CD1D expression. Rescue assays demonstrated that restoring CD1D expression counteracted the inhibitory phenotypes resulting from KCNMB2-AS1 silencing. CONCLUSION: KCNMB2-AS1 serves as an oncogenic lncRNA in ccRCC, functioning through a FOXP3/KCNMB2-AS1/miR-744-3p/CD1D signaling axis, thereby revealing a novel molecular pathway that contributes to ccRCC progression.",background long noncod rna lncrna key regul cancer progress among kcnmb2 antisens rna 1 kcnmb2as1 identifi oncogen lncrna sever tumor type howev role clearcel renal cell carcinoma ccrcc remain larg unexplor studi aim elucid express profil function signific underli molecular mechan kcnmb2as1 ccrcc method express kcnmb2as1 ccrcc tissu cell line analyz use publicli avail dataset quantit realtim pcr western blot function assay includ cell count kit8 coloni format wound heal transwel migrationinvas test along vivo xenograft experi perform assess biolog effect mechanist studi includ luciferas report chromatin immunoprecipit chip rna immunoprecipit rip rescu assay conduct verifi regulatori interact among kcnmb2as1 forkhead box protein 3 foxp3 microrna7443p mir7443p cluster differenti 1d cd1d result kcnmb2as1 express markedli elev ccrcc tissu compar adjac normal tissu high express significantli associ advanc tumor stage presenc distant metastasi poor overal surviv silenc kcnmb2as1 markedli suppress ccrcc cell prolifer migrat invas vitro accompani reduc epithelialmesenchym transit marker express consist find xenograft experi confirm kcnmb2as1 knockdown attenu tumor growth vivo overexpress promot aggress tumor behavior mechanist foxp3 directli bound promot region kcnmb2as1 activ express transcript kcnmb2as1 act molecular spong mir7443p therebi reliev inhibitori effect cd1d express rescu assay demonstr restor cd1d express counteract inhibitori phenotyp result kcnmb2as1 silenc conclus kcnmb2as1 serv oncogen lncrna ccrcc function foxp3kcnmb2as1mir7443pcd1d signal axi therebi reveal novel molecular pathway contribut ccrcc progress
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is crucial to detect cardiotoxicity. Manual methods are time-consuming and limited by inter-reader variability, highlighting the need for precise, reproducible and rapid semi-automated digital tools in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the triplicate concatenation method (TCM) using a semi-automated ECG software (CalECG-4.2, AMPS(R)) by assessing intra- and inter-reader variabilities in two distinct cardio-oncology populations: breast cancer patients receiving ribociclib (a QT-prolonging drug) and patients admitted with severe immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI)-myocarditis, a condition marked by QRS alterations. METHODS: A total of 420 ECG from 31 patients (21 ribociclib, and 10 ICI-myocarditis) were independently analyzed by two readers. Variability was assessed using Bland-Altman analyses and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Linear mixed-effects modelling quantified time-dependent changes in heart rate (HR), PR, QTc (Fridericia's HR correction), QRS duration and voltage (Sokolow-Lyon) accounting for inter-reader variability. RESULTS: Intra and inter-reader reproducibility was excellent (ICC > 0.98, including Sokolow-Lyon voltage; standard-deviation < 4 ms across all time-derived parameters). In ribociclib-treated patients (cycles of 21/28 days on drug), QTc peaked at day 14 (16 +/- 1 ms, p < 0.001) before decreasing by day 28 (-6 +/- 1 ms, p < 0.001) compared to baseline. In ICI-myocarditis, QRS duration increased at day 5 before returning to baseline starting day 28, while Sokolow-Lyon voltages increased progressively on immunosuppressive treatments, peaking at day 28 (458 +/- 49 microV, p < 0.001) and remaining constant afterwards for the next month. CONCLUSION: TCM with CalECG-4.2 ensures a high reproducibility while monitoring key parameters like QTc duration and Sokolow-Lyon voltage, making it a reliable and time-saving alternative for the ECG surveillance of drug toxicities in cardio-oncology.",background electrocardiogram ecg analysi crucial detect cardiotox manual method timeconsum limit interread variabl highlight need precis reproduc rapid semiautom digit tool clinic practic object studi evalu triplic concaten method tcm use semiautom ecg softwar calecg42 ampsr assess intra interread variabl two distinct cardiooncolog popul breast cancer patient receiv ribociclib qtprolong drug patient admit sever immun checkpoint inhibitor icimyocard condit mark qr alter method total 420 ecg 31 patient 21 ribociclib 10 icimyocard independ analyz two reader variabl assess use blandaltman analys intraclass correl coeffici icc linear mixedeffect model quantifi timedepend chang heart rate hr pr qtc fridericia hr correct qr durat voltag sokolowlyon account interread variabl result intra interread reproduc excel icc 098 includ sokolowlyon voltag standarddevi 4 ms across timederiv paramet ribociclibtr patient cycl 2128 day drug qtc peak day 14 16 1 ms p 0001 decreas day 28 6 1 ms p 0001 compar baselin icimyocard qr durat increas day 5 return baselin start day 28 sokolowlyon voltag increas progress immunosuppress treatment peak day 28 458 49 microv p 0001 remain constant afterward next month conclus tcm calecg42 ensur high reproduc monitor key paramet like qtc durat sokolowlyon voltag make reliabl timesav altern ecg surveil drug toxic cardiooncolog
cancer,"RNA viruses can generate ""defective"" viral genomes during replication, which can interact with standard viral genomes affecting the course of infections. These non-standard viral genomes are related to milder clinical outcomes and are currently being tested as antivirals. Decades of research in influenza have focused on viral mechanisms affecting the production of deletion-containing viral genomes (DelVGs). Based on adaptations of influenza NS1 protein to manipulate host cell metabolism, we hypothesized host metabolic state could also alter the quantity and pattern of deletion-containing viral genomes and the particles that house them. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated host cell anabolic signaling activity and monitored the production of DelVGs and non-infectious particles by two influenza strains, using single-cell immunofluorescence and third-generation sequencing. We show that: 1) influenza infection activates PI3K signaling, with the A/H1N1 strain having roughly double the pAKT levels in single cells as the A/H3N2; 2) alpelisib, a PI3K receptor inhibitor, subverted the ability of both influenza strains to activate PI3K in a dose dependent manner; 3) DelVGs were increased roughly tenfold in polymerase complex segments and ~ 60% in the hemagglutinin segment of A/H1N1 at 20uM of alpelisib; and 4) the A/H3N2 strain did not show changes in DelVG production, but had a modest, statistically significant maximum increase of 11% in non-infectious particles. We find that host cell metabolism can increase the production of non-infectious particles and DelVGs during single rounds of infection, shifting potential interactions among virions. The differential results according to strain and alpelisib concentration suggest future directions examining strain differences in the NS1::p85beta virus-host interaction and the specific metabolic state of the cell. Our study presents a new line of investigation into metabolic states associated with less severe flu infection and opens the possibility for potential induction of these states with metabolic drugs.",rna virus gener defect viral genom replic interact standard viral genom affect cours infect nonstandard viral genom relat milder clinic outcom current test antivir decad research influenza focus viral mechan affect product deletioncontain viral genom delvg base adapt influenza ns1 protein manipul host cell metabol hypothes host metabol state could also alter quantiti pattern deletioncontain viral genom particl hous test hypothesi manipul host cell anabol signal activ monitor product delvg noninfecti particl two influenza strain use singlecel immunofluoresc thirdgener sequenc show 1 influenza infect activ pi3k signal ah1n1 strain roughli doubl pakt level singl cell ah3n2 2 alpelisib pi3k receptor inhibitor subvert abil influenza strain activ pi3k dose depend manner 3 delvg increas roughli tenfold polymeras complex segment 60 hemagglutinin segment ah1n1 20um alpelisib 4 ah3n2 strain show chang delvg product modest statist signific maximum increas 11 noninfecti particl find host cell metabol increas product noninfecti particl delvg singl round infect shift potenti interact among virion differenti result accord strain alpelisib concentr suggest futur direct examin strain differ ns1p85beta virushost interact specif metabol state cell studi present new line investig metabol state associ less sever flu infect open possibl potenti induct state metabol drug
cancer,"OBJECTIVES: Pediatric cancer survivors are at increased risk for vaccine-preventable diseases due to treatment-related immunosuppression. This study aimed to assess serological status for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) following chemotherapy and identify factors associated with antibody loss. RESULTS: Fifty-four pediatric cancer survivors (mean age 12.5 years) were evaluated at a median of 2.5 years (IQR 1.2, 5.4) after completing chemotherapy. All participants had received at least one MMR dose before their cancer diagnosis and had completed treatment at least six months prior. Overall, 43 patients (79.6%) were seronegative for at least one MMR component. Seronegativity was highest for measles (64.8%), followed by mumps (55.6%) and rubella (35.2%). Measles seronegativity was significantly associated with a longer interval since chemotherapy (> 5 years; p = 0.04) and older age at receipt of the second MMR dose (mean 86.4 vs. 44.9 months; p = 0.002). No significant associations were observed for mumps or rubella seronegativity. These findings indicate a substantial decline in MMR immunity after chemotherapy and support the incorporation of routine post-chemotherapy revaccination into survivorship care, especially in settings where serologic testing is not readily available.",object pediatr cancer survivor increas risk vaccineprevent diseas due treatmentrel immunosuppress studi aim assess serolog statu measl mump rubella mmr follow chemotherapi identifi factor associ antibodi loss result fiftyfour pediatr cancer survivor mean age 125 year evalu median 25 year iqr 12 54 complet chemotherapi particip receiv least one mmr dose cancer diagnosi complet treatment least six month prior overal 43 patient 796 seroneg least one mmr compon seroneg highest measl 648 follow mump 556 rubella 352 measl seroneg significantli associ longer interv sinc chemotherapi 5 year p 004 older age receipt second mmr dose mean 864 vs 449 month p 0002 signific associ observ mump rubella seroneg find indic substanti declin mmr immun chemotherapi support incorpor routin postchemotherapi revaccin survivorship care especi set serolog test readili avail
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and cancer-related fatigue (CRF) are prevalent and debilitating side effects in breast cancer patients, adversely affecting treatment adherence and quality of life. Although exercise is beneficial, a standardized, practical protocol for integrating nurse-led exercise interventions into clinical pathways during chemotherapy is not yet established. METHODS: A three-round modified Delphi study was conducted between February and May 2025 among a multidisciplinary panel of 22 experts, including oncology nurses, breast oncologists, rehabilitation therapists, and patient advocates. Anonymized, structured questionnaires were administered electronically. Consensus was predefined as a mean score >/= 4.0 (on a 5-point Likert scale), agreement by >/= 75% of respondents, and standard deviation </= 1.0. Kendall's coefficient of concordance (W) was used to assess stability of rankings across rounds. RESULTS: High response rates were maintained across all rounds (100%, 95%, 100%). A strong consensus was achieved regarding 42 discrete items. Key agreements included: (1) initiating assessment and exercise prescription at the first chemotherapy cycle; (2) implementing a multi-component regimen combining aerobic, resistance, and balance training; (3) clearly defining nurses' roles in assessment, education, and monitoring; (4) personalizing exercise intensity based on daily patient-reported symptoms (e.g., fatigue); and (5) integrating digital tools for adherence support and documentation. CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes a robust expert consensus on a structured, nurse-led, personalized exercise intervention package for integration into the clinical pathway of breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The framework offers practical guidance for mitigating treatment-related side effects and improving patient outcomes. Future research should focus on evaluating its feasibility and effectiveness in diverse clinical settings.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Oncogenic KRAS mutations in cancer cells drive macropinocytosis, a pathway that scavenges extracellular proteins to obtain nutrients under metabolic stress. Lysosomal degradation is essential for processing these proteins, but the precise molecular link between macropinocytic uptake and lysosomal processing remains largely unclear. Aldolase A (ALDOA), a glycolytic enzyme, has diverse non-canonical functions. While interactions between ALDOA and Vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) subunits have been suggested, their functional role in lysosomal degradation of macropinocytosed cargo remains undefined. METHODS: We investigated the role of ALDOA using integrated approaches, including The Cancer Genome Atlas data analysis and in vitro assays of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines to evaluate macropinocytosis, lysosomal degradation, lysosomal pH, and interactions with V-ATPase. We also assessed mTORC1 signaling and cell proliferation under nutrient-deprived and anchorage-independent conditions. In vivo relevance was tested in xenograft tumor models. RESULTS: High expression of ALDOA correlated with a poor prognosis for patients with KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. Functionally, ALDOA selectively regulated lysosomal degradation of macropinocytosed proteins without affecting their uptake. Mechanistically, ALDOA interacted physically with V-ATPase subunits to increase lysosomal acidification, uncovering a novel, non-enzymatic role that is independent of its glycolytic function. This interaction was essential for efficient nutrient utilization, sustained mTORC1 activity, and cell proliferation under metabolic and mechanical stress. In vivo, depletion of ALDOA inhibited macropinocytosis-dependent tumor growth, phenocopying treatment with 5-(N-Ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride. CONCLUSION: Our study identifies a novel, non-enzymatic function of ALDOA as a critical regulator of lysosomal degradation of macropinocytosed proteins via interaction with V-ATPase. This mechanism is essential for metabolic adaptation and growth of KRAS-mutant tumors under stress conditions. Targeting ALDOA offers a promising therapeutic strategy for cancers that rely on extracellular nutrient scavenging.",background oncogen kra mutat cancer cell drive macropinocytosi pathway scaveng extracellular protein obtain nutrient metabol stress lysosom degrad essenti process protein precis molecular link macropinocyt uptak lysosom process remain larg unclear aldolas aldoa glycolyt enzym divers noncanon function interact aldoa vacuolartyp hatpas vatpas subunit suggest function role lysosom degrad macropinocytos cargo remain undefin method investig role aldoa use integr approach includ cancer genom atla data analysi vitro assay lung adenocarcinoma cell line evalu macropinocytosi lysosom degrad lysosom ph interact vatpas also assess mtorc1 signal cell prolifer nutrientdepriv anchorageindepend condit vivo relev test xenograft tumor model result high express aldoa correl poor prognosi patient krasmut lung adenocarcinoma function aldoa select regul lysosom degrad macropinocytos protein without affect uptak mechanist aldoa interact physic vatpas subunit increas lysosom acidif uncov novel nonenzymat role independ glycolyt function interact essenti effici nutrient util sustain mtorc1 activ cell prolifer metabol mechan stress vivo deplet aldoa inhibit macropinocytosisdepend tumor growth phenocopi treatment 5nethylnisopropyl amilorid conclus studi identifi novel nonenzymat function aldoa critic regul lysosom degrad macropinocytos protein via interact vatpas mechan essenti metabol adapt growth krasmut tumor stress condit target aldoa offer promis therapeut strategi cancer reli extracellular nutrient scaveng
cancer,"PURPOSE: Patients with breast cancer and brain metastasis (BCBM) have poor survival outcomes. We aim to explore predictors of survival in patients with BCBM including the Breast Graded Prognostic Assessment -GPA tool and its variables and review the impact of emerging targeted therapies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Cleveland Clinic database was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients diagnosed with BCBM between 2010 and 2020 at multiple treatment centers in Ohio and Florida. Data on demographic, clinical, and treatment variables were collected, including BC surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, HER2-targeted therapy, immunotherapy, PARP inhibitors, CDK4/6 inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), BM characteristics (number, size, location), extracranial metastasis (ECM), and BM treatments. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate median overall survival (mOS), and univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were adopted to identify significant survival predictors. RESULTS: N = 318 evaluable patients with BCBM were included. Patients were aged 46-60 years (42.5%), female (99.7%), of white race (79.6%), and non-Hispanic (97.2%). Among BC subtypes, the triple positive subgroup had the longest mOS, while the triple negative subgroup had the shortest. Having one or less ECM was linked to longer survival compared to >/= 2 ECM. Patients receiving HER2-targeted therapy, PARP inhibitors, and TKIs had significantly longer mOS than those who did not receive targeted agents. Additionally, patients who underwent BM surgery had significantly longer mOS. Patients treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) such gamma knife radiosurgery had the longest mOS among the radiotherapy subgroups. CONCLUSION: BCBM is a heterogeneous population with variable outcomes. This analysis suggests that several factors influence the development and outcome after BCBM with HR+/HER2- subgroup having the longest median time to develop BM compared to other subgroups. Survival after BCBM is impacted by age, performance status and overall disease burden, as well as the use of novel targeted therapies suggesting the feasibility to overcome the historical blood brain barrier to systemic treatment benefit from chemotherapy. Brain surgery and Radiation modalities also play an important role in improving long term outcome. These results support updating current prognostic models, such as the Breast-GPA, by integrating treatment exposures, shifting from static baseline scores to dynamic, treatment-informed prognostication.",purpos patient breast cancer brain metastasi bcbm poor surviv outcom aim explor predictor surviv patient bcbm includ breast grade prognost assess gpa tool variabl review impact emerg target therapi patient method cleveland clinic databas retrospect review identifi patient diagnos bcbm 2010 2020 multipl treatment center ohio florida data demograph clinic treatment variabl collect includ bc surgeri radiotherapi chemotherapi endocrin therapi her2target therapi immunotherapi parp inhibitor cdk46 inhibitor tyrosin kinas inhibitor tki bm characterist number size locat extracrani metastasi ecm bm treatment kaplanmei method use calcul median overal surviv mo univari multivari cox regress model adopt identifi signific surviv predictor result n 318 evalu patient bcbm includ patient age 4660 year 425 femal 997 white race 796 nonhispan 972 among bc subtyp tripl posit subgroup longest mo tripl neg subgroup shortest one less ecm link longer surviv compar 2 ecm patient receiv her2target therapi parp inhibitor tki significantli longer mo receiv target agent addit patient underw bm surgeri significantli longer mo patient treat stereotact radiosurgeri sr gamma knife radiosurgeri longest mo among radiotherapi subgroup conclus bcbm heterogen popul variabl outcom analysi suggest sever factor influenc develop outcom bcbm hrher2 subgroup longest median time develop bm compar subgroup surviv bcbm impact age perform statu overal diseas burden well use novel target therapi suggest feasibl overcom histor blood brain barrier system treatment benefit chemotherapi brain surgeri radiat modal also play import role improv long term outcom result support updat current prognost model breastgpa integr treatment exposur shift static baselin score dynam treatmentinform prognost
cancer,"Approximately 5-10% of all cancer types are hereditary cancer syndromes, which are caused by pathogenic mutations in cancer susceptibility genes. In this investigation, a hereditary cancer pedigree was collected from a province in southern China, and the proband was a 31-year-old woman with breast cancer. Utilizing blood whole exome sequencing technology and bioinformatics analysis, the sole heterozygous missense mutation in PIBF1 that exhibits trait segregation was identified: PIBF1 (p.R405Q). The pedigree also included two other mutations that may be linked to carcinogenesis: RAD51D (p.K91Ifs*13) and BRCA2 (p.G3134Afs*29). This research concentrated on PIBF1 (p.R405Q) and employed breast cancer as a tumor model. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that PIBF1-WT suppressed breast cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, invasive ability, and tumorigenesis. However, PIBF1 (p.R405Q) attenuated or inhibited the function of PIBF1-WT. Mechanistically, PIBF1-WT resisted cisplatin-induced DNA damage, significantly down-regulated the expression of gamma-H2AX, and affected DNA damage repair, thus exerting a cancer inhibitory function. Interestingly, PIBF1 (p.R405Q) affects protein stability, thereby mitigating or eliminating the inhibitory effect of PIBF1. Furthermore, this family's polygenic risk factors for cancer are analyzed, and there is speculation about potential synergistic effects between PIBF1 and DNA damage repair genes like BRCA2 and RAD51D. In conclusion, PIBF1 regulates the cell cycle and DNA damage repair, PIBF1(p.R405Q) increases susceptibility to cancer, multiple DNA damage repair gene mutations may synergistically promote cancer progression in this cancer family lineage, and PIBF1(p.R405Q) may be one of the polygenic risk factors for familial hereditary cancer syndromes.",approxim 510 cancer type hereditari cancer syndrom caus pathogen mutat cancer suscept gene investig hereditari cancer pedigre collect provinc southern china proband 31yearold woman breast cancer util blood whole exom sequenc technolog bioinformat analysi sole heterozyg missens mutat pibf1 exhibit trait segreg identifi pibf1 pr405q pedigre also includ two mutat may link carcinogenesi rad51d pk91ifs13 brca2 pg3134afs29 research concentr pibf1 pr405q employ breast cancer tumor model vitro vivo experi show pibf1wt suppress breast cancer cell prolifer coloni format invas abil tumorigenesi howev pibf1 pr405q attenu inhibit function pibf1wt mechanist pibf1wt resist cisplatininduc dna damag significantli downregul express gammah2ax affect dna damag repair thu exert cancer inhibitori function interestingli pibf1 pr405q affect protein stabil therebi mitig elimin inhibitori effect pibf1 furthermor famili polygen risk factor cancer analyz specul potenti synergist effect pibf1 dna damag repair gene like brca2 rad51d conclus pibf1 regul cell cycl dna damag repair pibf1pr405q increas suscept cancer multipl dna damag repair gene mutat may synergist promot cancer progress cancer famili lineag pibf1pr405q may one polygen risk factor famili hereditari cancer syndrom
cancer,"Imagine the future where melanoma, one of the most lethal types of skin cancer, is not a frightful diagnosis anymore but a challenge met with tailored precision medicine. Despite advances, its treatment remains hindered by the triple barrier of metabolic reprogramming, immune escape, and inefficient nano-delivery. This review explores the transformative intersection of nanotechnology methodologies and precision medicine, addressing the central question: how these barriers can be overcome to achieve durable and personalized responses? Beyond summarizing current progress, it introduces the Metabolism-Immune-Nano Collaborative (MIN-C) Framework as an integrated perspective, where molecular insights, patient-specific data, and innovative nanomaterials converge to redefine care. The analysis begins by dissecting melanoma genetic and molecular complexities as a systemic disease, revealing the interplay between driver mutations, immune escape mechanisms, and the many players of the tumor microenvironment. The discussion shifts to the pivotal role of nanotechnology as a powerful ally breaking delivery barriers, amplifying immune responses, and enabling real-time monitoring of disease progression. This article proposes using the TME metabolic reprograming as a starting point for the design of nanoimmunotherapy, rather than an endpoint, complemented by precision medicine guiding decisions through biomarkers and genomic profiling, ensuring that each intervention is as unique as the patient it serves.",imagin futur melanoma one lethal type skin cancer fright diagnosi anymor challeng met tailor precis medicin despit advanc treatment remain hinder tripl barrier metabol reprogram immun escap ineffici nanodeliveri review explor transform intersect nanotechnolog methodolog precis medicin address central question barrier overcom achiev durabl person respons beyond summar current progress introduc metabolismimmunenano collabor minc framework integr perspect molecular insight patientspecif data innov nanomateri converg redefin care analysi begin dissect melanoma genet molecular complex system diseas reveal interplay driver mutat immun escap mechan mani player tumor microenviron discuss shift pivot role nanotechnolog power alli break deliveri barrier amplifi immun respons enabl realtim monitor diseas progress articl propos use tme metabol reprogram start point design nanoimmunotherapi rather endpoint complement precis medicin guid decis biomark genom profil ensur intervent uniqu patient serv
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 900,000 MRI brain scans are performed annually in the United Kingdom alone, with incidental findings frequently encountered. One of the most prevalent findings is white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). WMHs often indicate cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) but can also be associated with migraine and demyelination. Prospective population studies have already confirmed a high prevalence of WMHs in elderly patients. In younger patients, or when the radiological burden is low, WMHs are commonly considered non-specific. Routinely collected data represents a valuable resource to facilitate further study. We aimed to describe the prevalence of WMHs in a direct to scan referral population and to understand associations with age, demographics, performance status and referral criteria. METHODS: We performed a service evaluation of our local two-week wait suspected central nervous system cancer pathway to understand the association between age, demographics, performance status, referral criteria, imaging outcomes and both the prevalence and radiological characteristics of WMHs. Analysis was performed using R version 4.1.3. RESULTS: We identified 1033 patients, referred over a 30-month period. Mean patient age was 51.3+/-18.3 years with 65% females. As expected, WMHs were present on 89.7% of scans in patients aged over 80, with 98.1% of these consistent with cSVD upon review by an experienced neuroradiologist. We show an important association between WMHs deemed representative of cSVD and both performance status and levels of deprivation. However, WMHs were also present in approximately 1 in 5 patients under 50 years old and were typically deemed non-specific. Our analysis showed prevalence of WMH, its radiological burden and likelihood of WMHs being attributed to cSVD all increased with age. It is therefore feasible to consider that these changes may represent early cSVD. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a prevalence of radiological cSVD comparable to the wider literature in elderly patients whilst highlighting the potential underestimation of cSVD in the younger population, in whom further study of WMHs is required. There is potential for routinely collected data to define the prevalence and characteristics of radiological cSVD more accurately whilst facilitating further research.",background approxim 900000 mri brain scan perform annual unit kingdom alon incident find frequent encount one preval find white matter hyperintens wmh wmh often indic cerebr small vessel diseas csvd also associ migrain demyelin prospect popul studi alreadi confirm high preval wmh elderli patient younger patient radiolog burden low wmh commonli consid nonspecif routin collect data repres valuabl resourc facilit studi aim describ preval wmh direct scan referr popul understand associ age demograph perform statu referr criteria method perform servic evalu local twoweek wait suspect central nervou system cancer pathway understand associ age demograph perform statu referr criteria imag outcom preval radiolog characterist wmh analysi perform use r version 413 result identifi 1033 patient refer 30month period mean patient age 513183 year 65 femal expect wmh present 897 scan patient age 80 981 consist csvd upon review experienc neuroradiologist show import associ wmh deem repres csvd perform statu level depriv howev wmh also present approxim 1 5 patient 50 year old typic deem nonspecif analysi show preval wmh radiolog burden likelihood wmh attribut csvd increas age therefor feasibl consid chang may repres earli csvd conclus demonstr preval radiolog csvd compar wider literatur elderli patient whilst highlight potenti underestim csvd younger popul studi wmh requir potenti routin collect data defin preval characterist radiolog csvd accur whilst facilit research
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a prevalent and often aggressive malignancy. While ribosome production is a critical process in numerous cancers, the role of ribosome biogenesis-related genes (RB-RGs) in PCa remains underexplored. Therefore, this study aims to examine the expression characteristics of RB-RGs as potential prognostic markers in PCa. METHODS: Transcriptomic data were obtained from public databases to pinpoint differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with PCa. Among these, DEGs that were also identified as regulatory genes were selected as candidate genes and subjected to regression analysis to determine those with prognostic significance. A prognostic risk model was then created and subjected to validation. A standalone prognostic evaluation was performed. Additionally, analyses for enrichment, immune infiltration, and drug prediction were conducted for both high- and low-risk PCa cohorts. Finally, the levels of the prognostic genes were validated through reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western Blot (WB). RESULTS: SMARCA4, FBLL1, RRS1, and NVL were selected as prognostic genes. A risk model, exhibited considerable precision in evaluating the risk of PCa. The risk score, in conjunction with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) score and Gleason score, has been recognized as independent prognostic factors for PCa. Analysis of biological pathways indicated notable variations in pathways, especially the cell cycle, when comparing the high- and low-risk groups. The expression of prognostic genes demonstrated a correlation with the presence of 21 distinct types of immune cells, notably including type-17 T helper cells, within PCa samples. Furthermore, notable variations in the levels of target genes (AKT1, CDK1, HIF1A, NFKB1, SRC, and TRIM24) were detected between the high- and low-risk cohorts in relation to different chemotherapeutic agents. PCR analysis showed that NVL and SMARCA4 were significantly upregulated in PCa samples (p < 0.05), with no significant difference in RRS 1. WB analysis showed that SMARCA4, FBLL 1, and RRS1 and NVL were differently expressed in both PCa and Control, with higher upregulation in PCa than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Among RB-RGs, SMARCA4, FBLL1, RRS1 and NVL were identified as prognostic genes for PCa, thereby providing a new direction for clinical disease treatment.",background prostat cancer pca preval often aggress malign ribosom product critic process numer cancer role ribosom biogenesisrel gene rbrg pca remain underexplor therefor studi aim examin express characterist rbrg potenti prognost marker pca method transcriptom data obtain public databas pinpoint differenti express gene deg associ pca among deg also identifi regulatori gene select candid gene subject regress analysi determin prognost signific prognost risk model creat subject valid standalon prognost evalu perform addit analys enrich immun infiltr drug predict conduct high lowrisk pca cohort final level prognost gene valid revers transcript quantit polymeras chain reaction rtqpcr western blot wb result smarca4 fbll1 rrs1 nvl select prognost gene risk model exhibit consider precis evalu risk pca risk score conjunct prostatespecif antigen psa score gleason score recogn independ prognost factor pca analysi biolog pathway indic notabl variat pathway especi cell cycl compar high lowrisk group express prognost gene demonstr correl presenc 21 distinct type immun cell notabl includ type17 helper cell within pca sampl furthermor notabl variat level target gene akt1 cdk1 hif1a nfkb1 src trim24 detect high lowrisk cohort relat differ chemotherapeut agent pcr analysi show nvl smarca4 significantli upregul pca sampl p 005 signific differ rr 1 wb analysi show smarca4 fbll 1 rrs1 nvl differ express pca control higher upregul pca control group conclus among rbrg smarca4 fbll1 rrs1 nvl identifi prognost gene pca therebi provid new direct clinic diseas treatment
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: It is unclear whether patients with breast cancer (BC) who undergo mastectomy experience delays in adjuvant treatment when bilateral surgery is performed. This study was conducted with the objective of addressing this knowledge gap. METHODS: Stage 0-III BC patients who underwent mastectomy (including conventional mastectomy, nipple-sparing mastectomy [NSM], and skin-sparing mastectomy [SSM]) at a Swiss university hospital between 01/2013 and 12/2023 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to detect predictors of time to adjuvant treatment. RESULTS: A total of 394 patients were included, 308 (78.2%) of whom underwent unilateral mastectomy (UM) and 86 (21.8%) of whom underwent bilateral mastectomy (BM). Compared with patients who underwent UM, those who underwent BM were younger (median age [years] 49 vs. 60), more likely to carry a pathogenic germline BRCA variant (28.7% vs. 2.6%), presented with bilateral breast cancer (14.9% vs. 0%), and underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (34.5% vs. 12.4%). Patients who underwent BM were more likely to receive NSM or SSM (81.4% vs. 52.9%) and to develop wound healing disorders (20.7% vs. 11.4%). On univariable analysis, no differences in time to any adjuvant treatment were observed between BMs and UMs (median [days] 34 vs. 33; p = 0.444). Multivariable analysis suggested that bilateral mastectomy was associated with a shorter time to adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.15-5.58). Short-term postoperative complications were associated with prolonged time to any adjuvant treatment (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.36-0.71) and time to adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17-0.79). CONCLUSION: Undergoing BM did not result in a delay in time to adjuvant treatment in comparison to UM.",introduct unclear whether patient breast cancer bc undergo mastectomi experi delay adjuv treatment bilater surgeri perform studi conduct object address knowledg gap method stage 0iii bc patient underw mastectomi includ convent mastectomi nipplespar mastectomi nsm skinspar mastectomi ssm swiss univers hospit 012013 122023 identifi prospect maintain databas multivari cox proport hazard regress model use detect predictor time adjuv treatment result total 394 patient includ 308 782 underw unilater mastectomi um 86 218 underw bilater mastectomi bm compar patient underw um underw bm younger median age year 49 vs 60 like carri pathogen germlin brca variant 287 vs 26 present bilater breast cancer 149 vs 0 underw neoadjuv chemotherapi 345 vs 124 patient underw bm like receiv nsm ssm 814 vs 529 develop wound heal disord 207 vs 114 univari analysi differ time adjuv treatment observ bm um median day 34 vs 33 p 0444 multivari analysi suggest bilater mastectomi associ shorter time adjuv chemotherapi hr 254 95 ci 115558 shortterm postop complic associ prolong time adjuv treatment hr 050 95 ci 036071 time adjuv chemotherapi hr 037 95 ci 017079 conclus undergo bm result delay time adjuv treatment comparison um
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types is a well-established risk factor for various malignancies, and timely vaccination of university students is a cost-effective strategy to reduce infection rates and the burden of HPV-associated consequences. Although many studies have examined HPV knowledge, vaccine acceptance, and uptake in university students, findings remain heterogeneous, and comprehensive quantitative synthesis is limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess global estimates of university students' knowledge of HPV and its vaccine, willingness to receive the vaccine, and actual vaccination behaviors. METHODS: The study was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) 2020 Checklist. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, China Biology Medicine disc, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wan Fang Database for studies published from January 2006 through August 2024. Studies with quality assessment scores > 5 and published in Chinese or English were included for data extraction. Pooled prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. The heterogeneity statistic I-squared and corresponding p value were also reported. RESULTS: A total of 56 studies covering 184,351 university students from four continents (Asia, Africa, Europe and North America) were included. Among students, 68.3% (95% CI 56.4%-79.0%) and 53.5% (95% CI 53.0%-54.1%) were aware of HPV and HPV vaccine, respectively, with significant gaps in knowledge about HPV symptoms, cervical cancer screening methods, and optimal vaccination timing. Pooled HPV vaccination willingness was 52.9% (95% CI 44.2%-61.6%), with higher willingness observed among females and medical students. Only 10.4% (95% CI 6.1%-15.8%) had received at least 1 dose of vaccination and 12.4% (95% CI 3.0%-26.9%) had completed the full three-dose schedule. Vaccination coverage among females was 8.6% (95% CI 3.7%-15.1%), and among medical students, 7.7% (95% CI 1.3%-18.4%). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis found that university students exhibit limited awareness of HPV and its vaccine, with about half willing to be vaccinated. Actual vaccination rates remain low and vary widely by gender, major, time of year, and geographic regions. These findings highlight the need for targeted intervention strategies, such as precision education and cross-sector collaboration, to effectively increase HPV vaccination coverage in this population.",background persist infect highrisk human papillomaviru hpv type wellestablish risk factor variou malign time vaccin univers student costeffect strategi reduc infect rate burden hpvassoci consequ although mani studi examin hpv knowledg vaccin accept uptak univers student find remain heterogen comprehens quantit synthesi limit systemat review metaanalysi aim assess global estim univers student knowledg hpv vaccin willing receiv vaccin actual vaccin behavior method studi report accord prefer report item systemat review metaanalysi prisma 2020 checklist systemat search conduct pubm web scienc china biolog medicin disc china nation knowledg infrastructur wan fang databas studi publish januari 2006 august 2024 studi qualiti assess score 5 publish chines english includ data extract pool preval estim 95 confid interv ci calcul use freemantukey doubl arcsin transform heterogen statist isquar correspond p valu also report result total 56 studi cover 184351 univers student four contin asia africa europ north america includ among student 683 95 ci 564790 535 95 ci 530541 awar hpv hpv vaccin respect signific gap knowledg hpv symptom cervic cancer screen method optim vaccin time pool hpv vaccin willing 529 95 ci 442616 higher willing observ among femal medic student 104 95 ci 61158 receiv least 1 dose vaccin 124 95 ci 30269 complet full threedos schedul vaccin coverag among femal 86 95 ci 37151 among medic student 77 95 ci 13184 conclus metaanalysi found univers student exhibit limit awar hpv vaccin half will vaccin actual vaccin rate remain low vari wide gender major time year geograph region find highlight need target intervent strategi precis educ crosssector collabor effect increas hpv vaccin coverag popul
cancer,"BACKGROUND: The optimal management of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after progression on osimertinib includes cytotoxic chemotherapy. Continuing osimertinib therapy beyond progressive disease (PD) is occasionally adopted in real-world practice; however, evidence for its efficacy is limited. In this multi-institutional retrospective study, we evaluated whether osimertinib continuation beyond PD could improve survival compared with the best supportive care (BSC) in such patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with EGFR-mutated advanced or recurrent NSCLC treated with osimertinib between March 2016 and September 2025 at three Japanese community hospitals. Patients with radiological progression or intolerable adverse events after osimertinib treatment were included Patients were classified into three groups: (1) osimertinib beyond PD, (2) BSC, and (3) chemotherapy after osimertinib. Overall survival (OS) was compared among the groups using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses adjusted for time-to-treatment failure (TTF). RESULTS: Of the 309 patients treated with osimertinib, 126 met the inclusion criteria. The median age of the patients was 77 years, and 23% had poor performance status (>/= 2). Osimertinib beyond PD was administered to 21 patients (16.7%), BSC to 36 patients (28.6%), and chemotherapy to 69 patients (54.8%). The median OS after osimertinib failure was 8.8, 2.6, and 15.5 months in the beyond PD, BSC, and chemotherapy groups, respectively (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, beyond PD was associated with significantly longer OS than BSC (hazard ratio: 0.34, 95% confidence interval: 0.18-0.66, p < 0.001), even after adjusting for TTF. CONCLUSIONS: In real-world settings involving elderly and frail patients, osimertinib continuation beyond PD was associated with improved survival compared with BSC alone. Although chemotherapy remains the preferred strategy when feasible, osimertinib continuation beyond PD may represent a reasonable treatment option for patients who are ineligible for further cytotoxic therapy. In the absence of other guiding biomarkers, TTF may help clinicians identify patients most likely to benefit from continued TKI administration.",background optim manag patient epiderm growth factor receptor egfrmut nonsmallcel lung cancer nsclc progress osimertinib includ cytotox chemotherapi continu osimertinib therapi beyond progress diseas pd occasion adopt realworld practic howev evid efficaci limit multiinstitut retrospect studi evalu whether osimertinib continu beyond pd could improv surviv compar best support care bsc patient method retrospect review patient egfrmut advanc recurr nsclc treat osimertinib march 2016 septemb 2025 three japanes commun hospit patient radiolog progress intoler advers event osimertinib treatment includ patient classifi three group 1 osimertinib beyond pd 2 bsc 3 chemotherapi osimertinib overal surviv os compar among group use kaplanmei cox regress analys adjust timetotreat failur ttf result 309 patient treat osimertinib 126 met inclus criteria median age patient 77 year 23 poor perform statu 2 osimertinib beyond pd administ 21 patient 167 bsc 36 patient 286 chemotherapi 69 patient 548 median os osimertinib failur 88 26 155 month beyond pd bsc chemotherapi group respect p 0001 multivari analysi beyond pd associ significantli longer os bsc hazard ratio 034 95 confid interv 018066 p 0001 even adjust ttf conclus realworld set involv elderli frail patient osimertinib continu beyond pd associ improv surviv compar bsc alon although chemotherapi remain prefer strategi feasibl osimertinib continu beyond pd may repres reason treatment option patient inelig cytotox therapi absenc guid biomark ttf may help clinician identifi patient like benefit continu tki administr
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Systematic biopsy (SBx) underdetects clinically significant prostate cancer and overdiagnoses indolent disease. This study compared the transperineal cognitive fusion targeted biopsy (COG-TBx)-which uses multiparametric MRI for precision-against SBx, evaluating their cancer detection rates and safety profiles in a clinical cohort. METHODS: A total of 360 patients undergoing transperineal prostate biopsy were included, with 161 assigned to the COG-TBx group and 199 to the SBx group. Primary outcomes included PCa detection, csPCa (defined as Gleason score >/= 3 + 4 or ISUP Level >/= 2), and 30-day complication rates. Secondary outcomes comprised cancer detection rate per core and pathological characteristics. Statistical analyses involved chi(2) tests, t-tests, and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups, though prostate volume was larger in the COG-TBx group (52.0 ml vs. 46.0 ml, P = 0.024). The COG-TBx group demonstrated significantly higher PCa (52.2% vs. 41.2%, P = 0.034) and csPCa detection rates (44.7% vs. 25.6%, P < 0.05), as well as a higher cancer detection rate per needle (28.5% vs. 19.3%, P = 0.003). The overall 30-day complication rate was slightly higher in the COG-TBx group (13.0% vs. 7.0%, P > 0.05), without statistical significance. Multivariate analysis identified COG-TBx (OR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.15-3.41, P = 0.013) and PSA level (OR = 1.12 per ng/mL, 95% CI: 1.03-1.22, P = 0.008) as independent predictors of csPCa detection. CONCLUSION: Transperineal COG-TBx is associated with higher detection rates for prostate cancer and clinically significant cancer compared to SBx. Although associated with a slightly higher complication rate, the difference was not significant. The overall benefit supports the clinical adoption of COG-TBx.",object systemat biopsi sbx underdetect clinic signific prostat cancer overdiagnos indol diseas studi compar transperin cognit fusion target biopsi cogtbxwhich use multiparametr mri precisionagainst sbx evalu cancer detect rate safeti profil clinic cohort method total 360 patient undergo transperin prostat biopsi includ 161 assign cogtbx group 199 sbx group primari outcom includ pca detect cspca defin gleason score 3 4 isup level 2 30day complic rate secondari outcom compris cancer detect rate per core patholog characterist statist analys involv chi2 test ttest multivari logist regress result baselin characterist compar group though prostat volum larger cogtbx group 520 ml vs 460 ml p 0024 cogtbx group demonstr significantli higher pca 522 vs 412 p 0034 cspca detect rate 447 vs 256 p 005 well higher cancer detect rate per needl 285 vs 193 p 0003 overal 30day complic rate slightli higher cogtbx group 130 vs 70 p 005 without statist signific multivari analysi identifi cogtbx 198 95 ci 115341 p 0013 psa level 112 per ngml 95 ci 103122 p 0008 independ predictor cspca detect conclus transperin cogtbx associ higher detect rate prostat cancer clinic signific cancer compar sbx although associ slightli higher complic rate differ signific overal benefit support clinic adopt cogtbx
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers (CAYAC) present unique challenges in oncology. Advances in treatment Have led to an 80% 5-year survival rate; however, CAYAC survivors (CAYACS) remain at high risk of long-term medical and psychosocial complications, significantly impacting their quality of life. Short and long-term follow-up care is recommended, but is often fragmented, with considerable disparities in availability and accessibility across Europe. Many existing digital tools primarily address medical needs, leaving psychosocial challenges unaddressed. The e-QuoL project aims to bridge these gaps by leveraging existing digital health solutions to provide equitable, person-centered survivorship care. METHODS: The e-QuoL project employs a participatory approach involving survivors, families, healthcare professionals (HCP), and researchers. Using the FormIT methodology, the project follows three phases: Explore, Create, and Evaluate. The Explore phase includes a large-scale cross-sectional survey across 15 European countries to assess the unmet needs of CAYACS and their families. The Create phase involves co-creation workshops to develop and refine digital tools, including MyCare(e-QuoL) tool, which will supplement survivorship care passports, to provide personalized medical and psychosocial support. The Evaluate phase comprises usability testing and clinical studies in at least seven European countries to assess effectiveness, scalability, and real-world applicability. DISCUSSION: The e-QuoL project builds on existing digital health innovations while adapting them to diverse European healthcare systems. By developing MyCare(e-QuoL), the project fosters a decentralized, person-centered model of survivorship care to promote equal access to quality survivorship support for CAYACS and HCPs. Ethical considerations, including data privacy, patient consent, and equitable access, are central to the project, with dedicated Ethics and Social Challenge Groups guiding implementation. Digital disparities remain a challenge, particularly for survivors from lower socio-economic backgrounds or remote areas. To mitigate this, e-QuoL will work with healthcare professionals to offer additional in-person support to complement digital interventions. The project aligns with Europe's Beating Cancer Plan, aiming to improve quality of life and reduce disparities in care. By fostering collaboration among 30 partners across 15 countries and hosting resources on the PanCare website, e-QuoL seeks to ensure long-term impact, contributing to the goal of high-quality, equitable survivorship care across Europe.",background childhood adolesc young adult cancer cayac present uniqu challeng oncolog advanc treatment led 80 5year surviv rate howev cayac survivor cayac remain high risk longterm medic psychosoci complic significantli impact qualiti life short longterm followup care recommend often fragment consider dispar avail access across europ mani exist digit tool primarili address medic need leav psychosoci challeng unaddress equol project aim bridg gap leverag exist digit health solut provid equit personcent survivorship care method equol project employ participatori approach involv survivor famili healthcar profession hcp research use formit methodolog project follow three phase explor creat evalu explor phase includ largescal crosssect survey across 15 european countri assess unmet need cayac famili creat phase involv cocreat workshop develop refin digit tool includ mycareequol tool supplement survivorship care passport provid person medic psychosoci support evalu phase compris usabl test clinic studi least seven european countri assess effect scalabl realworld applic discuss equol project build exist digit health innov adapt divers european healthcar system develop mycareequol project foster decentr personcent model survivorship care promot equal access qualiti survivorship support cayac hcp ethic consider includ data privaci patient consent equit access central project dedic ethic social challeng group guid implement digit dispar remain challeng particularli survivor lower socioeconom background remot area mitig equol work healthcar profession offer addit inperson support complement digit intervent project align europ beat cancer plan aim improv qualiti life reduc dispar care foster collabor among 30 partner across 15 countri host resourc pancar websit equol seek ensur longterm impact contribut goal highqual equit survivorship care across europ
cancer,"Pressurized Intraperitoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy (PIPAC) is an emerging method that delivers chemotherapeutic agents as aerosols directly into the peritoneal cavity to overcome poor tissue penetration. Although early clinical outcomes are promising, challenges remain, such as variable patient responses and the lack of appropriate preclinical models. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of PIPAC combined with three cytotoxic agents (Cisplatin, Oxaliplatin, and Paclitaxel) using patient-derived colorectal cancer organoid models. Our results demonstrates that PIPAC, especially when combined with Cisplatin, significantly enhances the cytotoxicity against colorectal cancer organoids and modulates key cancer-related pathways. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant alterations in gene expression patterns under PIPAC conditions, with notable impacts on cancer-related pathways such as epithelial-mesenchymal-transition and KRAS signaling. Pathway analysis further elucidated the modulation of cell-cycle related and oncogenic pathways by PIPAC, providing insights into its mechanism of action. These key findings suggest that PIPAC, particularly with Cisplatin, can enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy via transcriptomic modulation, supporting its potential clinical application in treating peritoneal carcinomatosis.",pressur intraperiton aerosol chemotherapi pipac emerg method deliv chemotherapeut agent aerosol directli periton caviti overcom poor tissu penetr although earli clinic outcom promis challeng remain variabl patient respons lack appropri preclin model studi investig efficaci pipac combin three cytotox agent cisplatin oxaliplatin paclitaxel use patientderiv colorect cancer organoid model result demonstr pipac especi combin cisplatin significantli enhanc cytotox colorect cancer organoid modul key cancerrel pathway transcriptom analysi reveal signific alter gene express pattern pipac condit notabl impact cancerrel pathway epithelialmesenchymaltransit kra signal pathway analysi elucid modul cellcycl relat oncogen pathway pipac provid insight mechan action key find suggest pipac particularli cisplatin enhanc chemotherapeut efficaci via transcriptom modul support potenti clinic applic treat periton carcinomatosi
cancer,"The importance of microbiota-associated metabolites in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumorigenesis highlights the need to investigate the microbiota and metabolome along the normal-adjacent-carcinoma sequence to explore their mechanistic implications in PDAC tumorigenesis. We characterized the pancreatic microbiota and metabolome in four distinct tissue groups using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and untargeted metabolomics: tumor tissues from 23 PDAC patients (PDAC T), their matched para-carcinoma tissues (PCT), tumor tissues from 13 pancreatic benign tumor patients (Control T), and their matched non-tumor tissues (Control N). For the selected metabolites, we verified their functional activities using cell proliferation assay. From Control N, through PCT, to PDAC T, there were 90 significantly differential genera, of which seven genera increased and 65 genera decreased sequentially. Specifically, Peptostreptococcus, norank_f__Mitochondria, and Ileibacterium increased, while Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, Subdoligranulum, and Coprococcus decreased sequentially. Among altered metabolites, beta-guanidinopropionic acid (GPA), S-(2-Carboxyethyl)-L-cysteine, L-lactic acid, and 3-hydroxybutanoic acid increased, while (3Z)-2-Propylpent-3-enoic acid, linoleic acid, and monopalmitin decreased sequentially. PDAC-associated metabolites were enriched in the GABAergic synapse, butanoate metabolism, purine metabolism, and CCM in cancer pathways. GPA and S-(2-Carboxyethyl)-L-cysteine were also enriched in the chemotherapy-resistant patients compared with chemotherapy-sensitive patients, while Faecalibacterium and (3Z)-2-Propylpent-3-enoic acid were also reduced. In both PDAC tumorigenesis and chemotherapy-resistant patients, decreased Faecalibacterium was positively correlated with (3Z)-2-Propylpent-3-enoic acid, but negatively correlated with GPA and S-(2-carboxyethyl)-L-cysteine. CCK8 assays confirmed that GPA and S-(2-carboxyethyl)-L-cysteine promoted the proliferation of PDAC cell lines. GPA and S-(2-Carboxyethyl)-L-cysteine were enriched in both PDAC tumorigenesis and chemotherapy-resistant patients, while Faecalibacterium and (3Z)-2-Propylpent-3-enoic acid were reduced. GPA and S-(2-carboxyethyl)-L-cysteine could promote the proliferation of PDAC cell lines.",import microbiotaassoci metabolit pancreat ductal adenocarcinoma pdac tumorigenesi highlight need investig microbiota metabolom along normaladjacentcarcinoma sequenc explor mechanist implic pdac tumorigenesi character pancreat microbiota metabolom four distinct tissu group use 16 rrna amplicon sequenc untarget metabolom tumor tissu 23 pdac patient pdac match paracarcinoma tissu pct tumor tissu 13 pancreat benign tumor patient control match nontumor tissu control n select metabolit verifi function activ use cell prolifer assay control n pct pdac 90 significantli differenti genera seven genera increas 65 genera decreas sequenti specif peptostreptococcu norankfmitochondria ileibacterium increas faecalibacterium ruminococcu subdoligranulum coprococcu decreas sequenti among alter metabolit betaguanidinopropion acid gpa s2carboxyethyllcystein llactic acid 3hydroxybutano acid increas 3z2propylpent3eno acid linol acid monopalmitin decreas sequenti pdacassoci metabolit enrich gabaerg synaps butano metabol purin metabol ccm cancer pathway gpa s2carboxyethyllcystein also enrich chemotherapyresist patient compar chemotherapysensit patient faecalibacterium 3z2propylpent3eno acid also reduc pdac tumorigenesi chemotherapyresist patient decreas faecalibacterium posit correl 3z2propylpent3eno acid neg correl gpa s2carboxyethyllcystein cck8 assay confirm gpa s2carboxyethyllcystein promot prolifer pdac cell line gpa s2carboxyethyllcystein enrich pdac tumorigenesi chemotherapyresist patient faecalibacterium 3z2propylpent3eno acid reduc gpa s2carboxyethyllcystein could promot prolifer pdac cell line

Applying SPLiCR-seq to investigate XBP1 splicing during the unfolded protein response (UPR), we conduct targeted and genome-wide screens across diverse cellular contexts, revealing both common and cell-type specific regulators. Notably, we identify GADD34 (PPP1R15A) as a novel modulator of IRE1alpha-XBP1 signaling, demonstrating that it directly interacts with IRE1alpha and functions independently of its canonical role in eIF2alpha dephosphorylation. Pharmacological inhibition of GADD34 using Sephin1 effectively suppressed XBP1 splicing and alleviated CAR-T cell exhaustion in an ex vivo model, leading to enhanced tumor-killing capacity across multiple cancer models. This work not only establishes a powerful new tool for systematically studying RNA splicing regulation but also uncovers a promising therapeutic strategy for improving CAR-T cell immunotherapy through modulation of the IRE1alpha-XBP1 pathway.",rna splice fundament cellular function yet systemat investig complex regul limit exist method present splicrseq splice regul identif crispr screen highthroughput crispr screen platform enabl direct measur rna splice outcom pool genet perturb overcom limit tradit fluorescencebas approach appli splicrseq investig xbp1 splice unfold protein respons upr conduct target genomewid screen across divers cellular context reveal common celltyp specif regul notabl identifi gadd34 ppp1r15a novel modul ire1alphaxbp1 signal demonstr directli interact ire1alpha function independ canon role eif2alpha dephosphoryl pharmacolog inhibit gadd34 use sephin1 effect suppress xbp1 splice allevi cart cell exhaust ex vivo model lead enhanc tumorkil capac across multipl cancer model work establish power new tool systemat studi rna splice regul also uncov promis therapeut strategi improv cart cell immunotherapi modul ire1alphaxbp1 pathway
cancer,"There is relatively low awareness about Human papillomavirus (HPV) in Saudi Arabia. Increased awareness is required to gain better knowledge, particularly among the general population. This study aims to evaluate the awareness level of women about cervical smears, HPV, and HPV vaccine. Also, this study evaluates the effectiveness of the Saudi Ministry of Health's campaign aimed to raise awareness of HPV and the HPV vaccine by comparing data collected before and after the campaign. This study employed a cross-sectional, online survey-based design conducted in Saudi Arabia. Data were collected during two periods: 2022 and 2024. The target participants were women aged 18 and older residing in Saudi Arabia. Exclusions included individuals with a history of HPV infection and those who did not provide consent. The questionnaire comprised 26 items, organized into three sections: sociodemographic information, awareness levels of HPV and the HPV vaccine, and cervical screening practices and vaccine acceptance. A total of 858 women participated in this study. Overall, 49.4% of women were aware of HPV, and 38% were aware of the HPV vaccine. Over two-thirds (67.6%) were willing to receive a free HPV vaccination. Social media was the most common source of information (HPV: 63.2%; HPV vaccine: 57.1%). From 2022 to 2024, there was a significant increase in HPV awareness, rising from 38.8% in 2022 to 71.1% in 2024 (p < 0.001), and awareness of the HPV vaccine significantly increased from 28.2% to 58.7% (p < 0.001). Despite these improvements in awareness, only 25.8% of participants reported having undergone cervical cancer screening (Pap smear). The main drivers for awareness are knowledge-based (knowing the vaccine exists for men/children, knowing where to get it). For acceptance of HPV vaccine, the strongest psychological driver is a parent's willingness to vaccinate their children. This study highlights the success of the Saudi Ministry of Health's campaign in raising awareness about HPV and its vaccine. Despite this progress, the low uptake of cervical cancer screening remains a critical public health issue. Greater emphasis on the importance of pap smear tests is needed to enhance early detection and prevention of cervical cancer.",rel low awar human papillomaviru hpv saudi arabia increas awar requir gain better knowledg particularli among gener popul studi aim evalu awar level women cervic smear hpv hpv vaccin also studi evalu effect saudi ministri health campaign aim rais awar hpv hpv vaccin compar data collect campaign studi employ crosssect onlin surveybas design conduct saudi arabia data collect two period 2022 2024 target particip women age 18 older resid saudi arabia exclus includ individu histori hpv infect provid consent questionnair compris 26 item organ three section sociodemograph inform awar level hpv hpv vaccin cervic screen practic vaccin accept total 858 women particip studi overal 494 women awar hpv 38 awar hpv vaccin twothird 676 will receiv free hpv vaccin social media common sourc inform hpv 632 hpv vaccin 571 2022 2024 signific increas hpv awar rise 388 2022 711 2024 p 0001 awar hpv vaccin significantli increas 282 587 p 0001 despit improv awar 258 particip report undergon cervic cancer screen pap smear main driver awar knowledgebas know vaccin exist menchildren know get accept hpv vaccin strongest psycholog driver parent willing vaccin children studi highlight success saudi ministri health campaign rais awar hpv vaccin despit progress low uptak cervic cancer screen remain critic public health issu greater emphasi import pap smear test need enhanc earli detect prevent cervic cancer
cancer,"Personalized assessment of immunocompetence and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair requires methods that are sensitive to genetic and molecular complexity beyond the well-known monogenic disorders. Inspired by decades of research using B cells to study DNA repair processes, here we present SWIBRID (SWItch junction Breakpoint Repertoire IDentification), a tool to systematically profile genomic junctions generated in vivo during antibody class switch recombination (CSR) in B cells. As CSR junctions reflect immune diversity and DNA repair proficiency, SWIBRID detects phenotypic manifestations of deficiencies via a highly scalable, blood-based PCR followed by long-read sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. We show that specific DNA repair defects, including cancer-associated mutations, exhibit distinct CSR junction patterns. Notably, SWIBRID distinguishes different types of DSB repair knockouts and identifies the respective genetic defect in cell lines. In 68 patients, we detect immunodeficiencies and DNA repair defects with high accuracy (area under the curve 0.99 and 0.84, respectively), and identify previously uncharacterized patient groups as well as patient-specific CSR junction signatures. With SWIBRID, we seek to advance the identification of pathogenic defects, support early diagnosis, and address molecular heterogeneity that drives variable clinical outcomes.",person assess immunocompet dna doublestrand break dsb repair requir method sensit genet molecular complex beyond wellknown monogen disord inspir decad research use b cell studi dna repair process present swibrid switch junction breakpoint repertoir identif tool systemat profil genom junction gener vivo antibodi class switch recombin csr b cell csr junction reflect immun divers dna repair profici swibrid detect phenotyp manifest defici via highli scalabl bloodbas pcr follow longread sequenc bioinformat analysi show specif dna repair defect includ cancerassoci mutat exhibit distinct csr junction pattern notabl swibrid distinguish differ type dsb repair knockout identifi respect genet defect cell line 68 patient detect immunodefici dna repair defect high accuraci area curv 099 084 respect identifi previous uncharacter patient group well patientspecif csr junction signatur swibrid seek advanc identif pathogen defect support earli diagnosi address molecular heterogen drive variabl clinic outcom

This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of perineal infections and identify associated risk factors in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma undergoing ELAPE with perineal reconstruction using an absorbable synthetic prosthesis. This prospective observational study including consecutive patients treated between 2009 and 2024. All patients underwent standardized perineal reconstruction with an absorbable synthetic prosthesis. Clinical, tumor, surgical, and postoperative complication variables were recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with perineal infection. A total of 61 patients were analyzed. Perineal infection occurred in 23%, with most infections developing within the first 30 postoperative days. Multivariate analysis identified obesity (Odds Ratio [OR] 74.3), active smoking (OR 33.7), and circumferential margin involvement observed on basal magnetic resonance imaging (OR 28) as independent risk factors. Patients with perineal infection had longer hospital stays, more readmissions, more postoperative visits, and higher complications severity. Infection was not associated with an increased rate of perineal hernia, which was low in our cohort (3%). In conclusion, perineal reconstruction with an absorbable synthetic prosthesis following ELAPE is safe and effective. Identification of patients at high risk for perineal infection enables targeted preventive strategies and informs future comparative studies of perineal reconstruction techniques.",extralev abdominoperin excis elap improv surgic margin distal rectal cancer compar convent amput howev associ higher rate perin morbid studi aim evalu incid perin infect identifi associ risk factor patient rectal adenocarcinoma undergo elap perin reconstruct use absorb synthet prosthesi prospect observ studi includ consecut patient treat 2009 2024 patient underw standard perin reconstruct absorb synthet prosthesi clinic tumor surgic postop complic variabl record univari multivari analys perform identifi factor associ perin infect total 61 patient analyz perin infect occur 23 infect develop within first 30 postop day multivari analysi identifi obes odd ratio 743 activ smoke 337 circumferenti margin involv observ basal magnet reson imag 28 independ risk factor patient perin infect longer hospit stay readmiss postop visit higher complic sever infect associ increas rate perin hernia low cohort 3 conclus perin reconstruct absorb synthet prosthesi follow elap safe effect identif patient high risk perin infect enabl target prevent strategi inform futur compar studi perin reconstruct techniqu
cancer,"Low‑dose CT (LDCT) screening reduces lung cancer mortality but yields high false‑positive findings, motivating practical AI that aligns with slice‑based clinical review. We evaluate a label‑efficient 2D pipeline that uses frozen RAD‑DINO embeddings from native‑resolution axial slices and a lightweight multilayer perceptron for patient‑level risk estimation via mean aggregation and isotonic calibration. Using the NLST CT arm with outcomes defined over a 0-24‑month window, we construct a fixed patient‑level split (one CT per patient; no cross‑split leakage) and perform 25 repeated imbalanced test draws (~ 6% prevalence) to approximate screening conditions. At screening prevalence, RAD‑DINO + MLP achieves PR‑AUC = 0.705 (calibrated; raw 0.554) and ROC‑AUC = 0.817 (raw; 0.736 calibrated), with improved probability reliability following calibration; operating points are selected on validation and reported on test. For secondary ablations only, a near‑balanced cohort (N = 1984) yields accuracy 0.966, precision 0.974, recall 0.973, F1 0.973, and ROC‑AUC 0.912. Beyond classification, retrieval with triplet‑fine‑tuned embeddings attains Precision@5 = 0.853. Interpretability analyses show that cancer cases sustain higher top‑k slice scores and that directional SHAP concentrates on a small subset of high‑probability slices; label‑colored t‑SNE provides qualitative views of embedding structure. Limitations include single‑cohort evaluation, lack of Lung‑RADS labels in public NLST, and a CXR --> CT pretraining shift; future work will pursue external validation and CT‑native self‑supervised continuation. Overall, frozen 2D foundation embeddings provide a strong, transparent, and computationally practical starting point for LDCT screening workflows under realistic prevalence.",low‑dos ct ldct screen reduc lung cancer mortal yield high false‑posit find motiv practic ai align slice‑bas clinic review evalu label‑effici 2d pipelin use frozen rad‑dino embed native‑resolut axial slice lightweight multilay perceptron patient‑level risk estim via mean aggreg isoton calibr use nlst ct arm outcom defin 024‑month window construct fix patient‑level split one ct per patient cross‑split leakag perform 25 repeat imbalanc test draw 6 preval approxim screen condit screen preval rad‑dino mlp achiev pr‑auc 0705 calibr raw 0554 roc‑auc 0817 raw 0736 calibr improv probabl reliabl follow calibr oper point select valid report test secondari ablat near‑balanc cohort n 1984 yield accuraci 0966 precis 0974 recal 0973 f1 0973 roc‑auc 0912 beyond classif retriev triplet‑fine‑tun embed attain precision5 0853 interpret analys show cancer case sustain higher top‑k slice score direct shap concentr small subset high‑prob slice label‑color t‑sne provid qualit view embed structur limit includ single‑cohort evalu lack lung‑rad label public nlst cxr ct pretrain shift futur work pursu extern valid ct‑nativ self‑supervis continu overal frozen 2d foundat embed provid strong transpar comput practic start point ldct screen workflow realist preval
cancer,"Recent breast cancer research has investigated shape-based attention guidance in Vision Transformer (ViT) models, focusing on anatomical structures and the heterogeneity surrounding tumors. However, few studies have clarified the optimal transformer encoder layer stage for applying attention guidance. Our study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of shape-guidance strategies by varying the combinations of encoder layers that guide attention to breast structures and by comparing the proposed models with conventional models. For the shape-guidance strategy, we applied breast masks to the attention mechanism to emphasize spatial dependencies and enhance the learning of positional relationships within breast anatomy. We then compared the representative models-Masked Transformer models that demonstrated the best performance across layer combinations-with the conventional ResNet50, ViT, and SwinT V2. In our study, a total of 2,436 publicly available mammography images from the Chinese Mammography Database via The Cancer Imaging Archive were analyzed. Three-fold cross-validation was employed, with a patient-wise split of 70% for training and 30% for validation. Model performance on differentiating breast cancer from non-cancer images was assessed by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The results showed that applying masks at the Shallow and Deep stages gave the highest AUROC for Masked ViT. The Masked ViT achieved an AUROC of 0.885 [95% confidence interval: 0.849-0.918], a sensitivity of 0.876, and a specificity of 0.802, outperforming all other conventional models. These results indicate that incorporating mask guidance into particular Transformer encoders promotes representation learning, highlighting their potential as decision-support tools in breast cancer diagnosis.",recent breast cancer research investig shapebas attent guidanc vision transform vit model focus anatom structur heterogen surround tumor howev studi clarifi optim transform encod layer stage appli attent guidanc studi aim evalu effect shapeguid strategi vari combin encod layer guid attent breast structur compar propos model convent model shapeguid strategi appli breast mask attent mechan emphas spatial depend enhanc learn posit relationship within breast anatomi compar repres modelsmask transform model demonstr best perform across layer combinationswith convent resnet50 vit swint v2 studi total 2436 publicli avail mammographi imag chines mammographi databas via cancer imag archiv analyz threefold crossvalid employ patientwis split 70 train 30 valid model perform differenti breast cancer noncanc imag assess area receiveroper characterist curv auroc result show appli mask shallow deep stage gave highest auroc mask vit mask vit achiev auroc 0885 95 confid interv 08490918 sensit 0876 specif 0802 outperform convent model result indic incorpor mask guidanc particular transform encod promot represent learn highlight potenti decisionsupport tool breast cancer diagnosi
cancer,"PURPOSE: This retrospective study compared the outcomes of radiotherapy (RT) and chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with T2N0 hypopharyngeal cancer. METHODS: We analyzed patients with T2N0 hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with RT or CRT between 2011 and 2016 using data from the Head and Neck Cancer Registry of Japan. RESULTS: Among 53,512 patients, 457 with T2N0 disease received RT (n = 165) or CRT (n = 292; median follow-up, 41.8 months; median age, 70 years). Tumor sites included the pyriform sinus (72.9%), postcricoid region (12.3%), posterior wall (11.8%), and unknown (3.1%). The groups differed in terms of age and alcohol use. Before weighing, CRT was associated with longer PFS and a lower cumulative incidence of locoregional recurrence compared with RT. However, in the IPTW-adjusted analysis, CRT did not significantly improve OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-1.62) or PFS (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.53-1.16) compared with RT. PFS was associated with alcohol/smoking history, performance status, and primary site of the tumor. CONCLUSION: In T2N0 hypopharyngeal cancer, CRT reduced the locoregional recurrence compared to RT. However, CRT did not confer a significant OS or PFS advantage over RT after adjustment for baseline imbalances. RT alone may, therefore, be a reasonable definitive treatment option for selected patients.",purpos retrospect studi compar outcom radiotherapi rt chemoradiotherapi crt patient t2n0 hypopharyng cancer method analyz patient t2n0 hypopharyng squamou cell carcinoma treat rt crt 2011 2016 use data head neck cancer registri japan result among 53512 patient 457 t2n0 diseas receiv rt n 165 crt n 292 median followup 418 month median age 70 year tumor site includ pyriform sinu 729 postcricoid region 123 posterior wall 118 unknown 31 group differ term age alcohol use weigh crt associ longer pf lower cumul incid locoregion recurr compar rt howev iptwadjust analysi crt significantli improv os hazard ratio hr 098 95 confid interv ci 059162 pf hr 079 95 ci 053116 compar rt pf associ alcoholsmok histori perform statu primari site tumor conclus t2n0 hypopharyng cancer crt reduc locoregion recurr compar rt howev crt confer signific os pf advantag rt adjust baselin imbal rt alon may therefor reason definit treatment option select patient
cancer,"PURPOSE: Our study endeavors to synthesize the expansive literature on cancer-related extracellular vesicles (EVs), mapping the research landscape and identifying key trends. METHODS: Bibliometric analysis was conducted on the EVs and cancer-related studies using the bibliometrix R-package, exploring growth patterns, research hotspots, and trends across 647 journals, 2769 institutions, 9919 authors, 4029 keywords, and 82626 references. To identify and explore the mechanical aspects of EV-cancer signatures, the stringr and dplyr packages were used to extract signatures from article titles and keywords. Functional annotation of these signatures was performed using the clusterProfiler package, and the Human Protein Atlas was utilized to confirm the protein activity of EV signatures in cancer. RESULTS: Our analysis reveals a global, collaborative research effort, with a 5.76% annual growth in publications, yet a decline in average citations post-2013 suggests a need for more impactful research. China, the United States, and Japan emerge as leading contributors, with China showing a notable upward trend. Research hotspots include exosomes, miRNA, biomarkers, and liquid biopsies, with future directions predicted in cancer treatment and diagnostics. EV-cancer signatures are linked to cancer progression and therapy resistance, offering mechanistic insights. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis revealed that several EV-cancer-related signatures were significantly associated with the ferroptosis pathway (p < 0.01), among which PRNP was found to be overexpressed at the protein level in pancreatic carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an overview of cancer-related EV research and identifies key directions for further mechanistic exploration and clinical translation of EVs in precision oncology.",purpos studi endeavor synthes expans literatur cancerrel extracellular vesicl ev map research landscap identifi key trend method bibliometr analysi conduct ev cancerrel studi use bibliometrix rpackag explor growth pattern research hotspot trend across 647 journal 2769 institut 9919 author 4029 keyword 82626 refer identifi explor mechan aspect evcanc signatur stringr dplyr packag use extract signatur articl titl keyword function annot signatur perform use clusterprofil packag human protein atla util confirm protein activ ev signatur cancer result analysi reveal global collabor research effort 576 annual growth public yet declin averag citat post2013 suggest need impact research china unit state japan emerg lead contributor china show notabl upward trend research hotspot includ exosom mirna biomark liquid biopsi futur direct predict cancer treatment diagnost evcanc signatur link cancer progress therapi resist offer mechanist insight moreov function enrich analysi reveal sever evcancerrel signatur significantli associ ferroptosi pathway p 001 among prnp found overexpress protein level pancreat carcinoma conclus studi provid overview cancerrel ev research identifi key direct mechanist explor clinic translat ev precis oncolog
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of MAT2A silencing on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer (GC) cells and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: MAT2A expression in GC tissues and adjacent normal tissues was assessed using immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Two GC cell lines with elevated MAT2A expression underwent gene silencing. Cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion were evaluated using EdU incorporation, Transwell, wound healing, and flow cytometry assays. Transcriptomic profiling was conducted to identify downstream pathways affected by MAT2A silencing, demonstrating significant enrichment of the p53 signaling pathway. To further clarify this mechanism, the p53 pathway was inhibited in MAT2A-silenced cells, and changes in p53 and p21 protein expression, along with alterations in proliferation, migration, and invasion, were reassessed. RESULTS: MAT2A expression was significantly higher in GC tissues and cell lines compared with adjacent normal controls. Silencing of MAT2A induced cell cycle arrest, suppressed proliferation and metastatic capacity, and enhanced apoptosis, accompanied by an increased expression of p53 and p21 proteins. Inhibition of p53 with PFT-alpha reduced both p53 and p21 levels and reversed the suppressive effects of MAT2A silencing on GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. CONCLUSION: MAT2A silencing induces cell cycle arrest, enhances apoptosis, and inhibits malignant phenotypes of GC cells, including proliferation, migration, and invasion, through activation of the p53 signaling pathway.",object studi aim evalu effect mat2a silenc prolifer migrat invas gastric cancer gc cell investig underli molecular mechan method mat2a express gc tissu adjac normal tissu assess use immunohistochemistri western blot two gc cell line elev mat2a express underw gene silenc cellular prolifer migrat invas evalu use edu incorpor transwel wound heal flow cytometri assay transcriptom profil conduct identifi downstream pathway affect mat2a silenc demonstr signific enrich p53 signal pathway clarifi mechan p53 pathway inhibit mat2asilenc cell chang p53 p21 protein express along alter prolifer migrat invas reassess result mat2a express significantli higher gc tissu cell line compar adjac normal control silenc mat2a induc cell cycl arrest suppress prolifer metastat capac enhanc apoptosi accompani increas express p53 p21 protein inhibit p53 pftalpha reduc p53 p21 level revers suppress effect mat2a silenc gc cell prolifer migrat invas conclus mat2a silenc induc cell cycl arrest enhanc apoptosi inhibit malign phenotyp gc cell includ prolifer migrat invas activ p53 signal pathway
cancer,"Apoptosis dysfunction is linked to diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. A key event during apoptosis is mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which typically proceeds in a rapid all-or-none fashion. If MOMP occurs only in a subset of mitochondria (minority MOMP), it can be sublethal and contribute to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Similarly, individual mitochondria escaping widespread MOMP (majority MOMP) can allow cancer cells to recover if apoptosis execution fails. How such heterogeneities in mitochondrial MOMP responsiveness arise within cells is incompletely understood. In particular, whether stochasticity in subcellular protein distributions and interactions across cytosol and mitochondria can realistically contribute to mitochondrial MOMP heterogeneity has not yet been studied. To assess this, we sequentially built and experimentally parameterized a particle-based, cell-sized model including cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments, and that featured a reduced interactome of MCL-1, BAK and tBID. High-performance computing enabled cell-scale simulations of protein distributions and interactions to understand how and under which conditions stochasticity could contribute to heterogeneity in MOMP susceptibility. Our results show that stochastic effects strongly predispose sub-pools of fragmented mitochondria to MOMP under low apoptotic stress. At higher apoptotic stress, fractions of small mitochondria were more likely to escape MOMP than large mitochondria. Retrospective quantification of mitochondrial sizes in experimental scenarios of minority and majority MOMP confirmed these findings. We therefore conclude that stochasticity substantially contributes to enabling small or fragmented mitochondria to undergo MOMP in minority MOMP scenarios and to escape MOMP in majority MOMP scenarios.",apoptosi dysfunct link diseas like cancer neurodegen disord key event apoptosi mitochondri outer membran permeabil momp typic proce rapid allornon fashion momp occur subset mitochondria minor momp subleth contribut tumorigenesi cancer progress similarli individu mitochondria escap widespread momp major momp allow cancer cell recov apoptosi execut fail heterogen mitochondri momp respons aris within cell incomplet understood particular whether stochast subcellular protein distribut interact across cytosol mitochondria realist contribut mitochondri momp heterogen yet studi assess sequenti built experiment parameter particlebas cellsiz model includ cytosol mitochondri compart featur reduc interactom mcl1 bak tbid highperform comput enabl cellscal simul protein distribut interact understand condit stochast could contribut heterogen momp suscept result show stochast effect strongli predispos subpool fragment mitochondria momp low apoptot stress higher apoptot stress fraction small mitochondria like escap momp larg mitochondria retrospect quantif mitochondri size experiment scenario minor major momp confirm find therefor conclud stochast substanti contribut enabl small fragment mitochondria undergo momp minor momp scenario escap momp major momp scenario
cancer,"The combination of PARP and NAMPT inhibitors (PARPi/NAMPTi) has been explored for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer, Ewing sarcoma and high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). However, dose limiting toxicity has hampered NAMPTi in clinical trials. To maximise the therapeutic window, we set out to identify predictive genomic biomarkers. Bioinformatic analysis and screening of a panel of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cell lines revealed that cells with RAS/PI3K pathway mutations are sensitive to the NAMPTi FK866. Combined exposure to olaparib and FK866 is associated with a reduction in nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and the PARP substrate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)), with coincident increases in ROS production, DNA damage and apoptosis induction. Caspase 3/7 activity is upregulated to a greater extent in RAS/PI3K mutant cell lines. Finally, the combination significantly reduces omental tumour weight and increases overall survival in mice injected with ID8 Trp53(-/-);Pten(-/-) cells.

cancer,"Ovarian cancer (OC) remains a major threat to women's health, with chemoresistance driven by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Formin-2 (FMN2), a cytoskeletal regulator, was investigated for its role in OC chemoresistance and macrophage polarization. Bioinformatics analysis identified high FMN2 expression in chemotherapy-resistant OC cell lines, validated experimentally. Stable FMN2 knockdown cell lines were generated via lentiviral transfection. Functional assays revealed that FMN2 overexpression conferred chemoresistance in vitro and in vivo and promoted M2 macrophage polarization via the CCL2/JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Co-culture with M2 macrophages enhanced cisplatin (DDP) resistance in OC cells, mediated by CXCL1 secretion, which activated the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Clinically, FMN2 levels correlated with CCL2 and CD206 (M2 marker) in platinum-resistant patients, and high FMN2, CCL2, or CD206 expression predicted poorer overall and disease-free survival. This study identifies FMN2 as a key mediator of chemoresistance and immune evasion in OC, proposing FMN2-CCL2-CD206 signaling and macrophage-derived CXCL1 as therapeutic targets and prognostic markers for chemotherapy response.",ovarian cancer oc remain major threat women health chemoresist driven immunosuppress tumor microenviron formin2 fmn2 cytoskelet regul investig role oc chemoresist macrophag polar bioinformat analysi identifi high fmn2 express chemotherapyresist oc cell line valid experiment stabl fmn2 knockdown cell line gener via lentivir transfect function assay reveal fmn2 overexpress confer chemoresist vitro vivo promot m2 macrophag polar via ccl2jak2stat3 pathway cocultur m2 macrophag enhanc cisplatin ddp resist oc cell mediat cxcl1 secret activ epithelialmesenchym transit emt pathway clinic fmn2 level correl ccl2 cd206 m2 marker platinumresist patient high fmn2 ccl2 cd206 express predict poorer overal diseasefre surviv studi identifi fmn2 key mediat chemoresist immun evas oc propos fmn2ccl2cd206 signal macrophagederiv cxcl1 therapeut target prognost marker chemotherapi respons
cancer,"PURPOSE: Oncofertility support plays a critical role in coping with fertility issues among women with breast cancer. There is a growing demand for reliable tools to assess and enhance oncofertility support. This study aimed to validate a tool assessing oncofertility support. METHODS: The study involved two phases. First, insights from healthcare professionals and women with breast cancer were used to modify the Fertility Information Support Scale, resulting in a 22-item Oncofertility Support Scale. Second, a cross-sectional study was conducted among 343 participants aged 18-40 to assess the scale's content validity, structural validity, measurement invariance, convergent validity, known-group validity, and internal consistency reliability. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis yielded a 19-item scale across four dimensions: information support on fertility impact, information support on fertility preservation, fertility and sexual guidance, and fertility communication and supportive networks. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the scale's structure. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis showed measurement invariance across age and fertility desire groups. The content validity for the scale was 0.95. Oncofertility support showed a weak association with medical social support. Average Variance Extracted (AVE >/= 0.63) and Composite Reliability (CR >/= 0.90) supported the convergent validity of the scale. Women aged </= 30 reported higher information support on fertility preservation and fertility communication and supportive networks than those older than 30. Both Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega were 0.95. CONCLUSION: The Oncofertility Support Scale is a valid and reliable measure for assessing oncofertility support among women with breast cancer.",purpos oncofertil support play critic role cope fertil issu among women breast cancer grow demand reliabl tool assess enhanc oncofertil support studi aim valid tool assess oncofertil support method studi involv two phase first insight healthcar profession women breast cancer use modifi fertil inform support scale result 22item oncofertil support scale second crosssect studi conduct among 343 particip age 1840 assess scale content valid structur valid measur invari converg valid knowngroup valid intern consist reliabl result exploratori factor analysi yield 19item scale across four dimens inform support fertil impact inform support fertil preserv fertil sexual guidanc fertil commun support network confirmatori factor analysi confirm scale structur multigroup confirmatori factor analysi show measur invari across age fertil desir group content valid scale 095 oncofertil support show weak associ medic social support averag varianc extract ave 063 composit reliabl cr 090 support converg valid scale women age 30 report higher inform support fertil preserv fertil commun support network older 30 cronbach alpha mcdonald omega 095 conclus oncofertil support scale valid reliabl measur assess oncofertil support among women breast cancer
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of oral mucositis in cetuximab-plus-radiotherapy compared to cisplatin-plus-radiotherapy in head and neck cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This PROSPERO-registered systematic review conducted searches through PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS, EBSCOhost, LIVIVO, Embase, and Grey literature (Google Scholar) until March 2025. Therefore, 10 articles were included for the evaluation in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed by Rob-2, and meta-analysis was performed (combined relative risk) in subgroups. The assessment of the certainty of evidence was analyzed by GRADE-pro. RESULTS: From 4118 reviewed articles, 10 RCTs were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, and 4329 patients were evaluated. The Rob was predominantly low. The relative risk of oral mucositis was 1.15 (95% CI = 1.03 to 1.29) higher in cetuximab-plus-radiotherapy compared with cisplatin-plus-radiotherapy in head and neck cancer patients (p = 0.010).

cancer,"The incidence of human papillomavirus-positive (HPV(+)) head and neck cancer (HNC), particularly oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), is rising globally. Although radio- or chemo-radiotherapy yields better outcomes for patients with HPV(+) tumors compared to those with HPV-negative tumors, these treatments do not cure all cases and are associated with significant side effects. This underscores the need for more personalized therapy. To help individualize treatment, we evaluated the presence of cell-free HPV DNA (cfHPV-DNA) in plasma collected before, during, and after therapy in patients with HPV(+) HNC and correlated cfHPV-DNA levels with clinical characteristics, HPV genotype, and treatment response. 267 longitudinal plasma samples were collected from 83 patients with HPV(+) HNC/cancer of unknown primary, at diagnosis/recurrence, during treatment and follow-ups, and tested for cfHPV-DNA with droplet digital PCR assaying for HPV16, 18, 33 or 35.39. 76/81 (93.8%) eligible diagnostic or recurrence samples tested positive for cfHPV-DNA, while a diagnostic sample was unavailable/or had inadequate cfDNA in 2/83 cases. cfHPV-DNA levels declined in most patients by 3-4 weeks post-radiotherapy initiation and became undetectable (fast responders) in approximately 30% of cases. By 3-6 months post-treatment, most patients had no detectable cfHPV-DNA. To date, no new recurrences have been documented, although two patients were unresponsive to therapy. Most HPV(+) OPSCC patients were cfHPV-DNA-positive at diagnosis and cleared their cfHPV-DNA upon treatment, but the speed of clearance varied depending on tumor sub-site, patient characteristics and treatment. The data suggest that follow-up with cfHPV-DNA is a promising clinical approach and should be expanded to include more patients and longer time periods.",incid human papillomavirusposit hpv head neck cancer hnc particularli oropharyng squamou cell carcinoma opscc rise global although radio chemoradiotherapi yield better outcom patient hpv tumor compar hpvneg tumor treatment cure case associ signific side effect underscor need person therapi help individu treatment evalu presenc cellfre hpv dna cfhpvdna plasma collect therapi patient hpv hnc correl cfhpvdna level clinic characterist hpv genotyp treatment respons 267 longitudin plasma sampl collect 83 patient hpv hnccancer unknown primari diagnosisrecurr treatment followup test cfhpvdna droplet digit pcr assay hpv16 18 33 3539 7681 938 elig diagnost recurr sampl test posit cfhpvdna diagnost sampl unavailableor inadequ cfdna 283 case cfhpvdna level declin patient 34 week postradiotherapi initi becam undetect fast respond approxim 30 case 36 month posttreat patient detect cfhpvdna date new recurr document although two patient unrespons therapi hpv opscc patient cfhpvdnaposit diagnosi clear cfhpvdna upon treatment speed clearanc vari depend tumor subsit patient characterist treatment data suggest followup cfhpvdna promis clinic approach expand includ patient longer time period
cancer,"BACKGROUND: As larger population-based studies assessing neoplasm risk in neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) are limited, we aimed to evaluate overall neoplasm risk, specific cancer types, and second primary cancers. METHODS: Using Danish registries and clinical databases, we identified 2053 individuals with NF1 and 20,530 population comparisons. We calculated cumulative incidences for first and second primary neoplasms for the study population born 1971-2020 and for adult-onset cancers in the study population born 1951-2020. We used multistate models to estimate the probabilities of being neoplasm-free, having one neoplasm, having >/=two neoplasms or being dead at a certain age. RESULTS: The 50-year cumulative incidence of any first neoplasm was 27.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 23.1-31.4%) for NF1 individuals and 5.0% (4.0-6.0%) for comparisons. Moreover, the cumulative incidence of second primary neoplasm was 21.1% (14.4-27.8%) for NF1 individuals and 6.4% (0.0-15.0%) for comparisons 20 years after the first neoplasm. A person born with NF1 had a 69.8% (65.6-74.2%) probability of being alive and without neoplasm history at age 50 compared to 93.5% (92.4-94.6%) for a person without NF1. CONCLUSION: The highly increased risks for primary and secondary neoplasms and mortality warrant close clinical surveillance of individuals with NF1.",background larger populationbas studi assess neoplasm risk neurofibromatosi 1 nf1 limit aim evalu overal neoplasm risk specif cancer type second primari cancer method use danish registri clinic databas identifi 2053 individu nf1 20530 popul comparison calcul cumul incid first second primari neoplasm studi popul born 19712020 adultonset cancer studi popul born 19512020 use multist model estim probabl neoplasmfre one neoplasm two neoplasm dead certain age result 50year cumul incid first neoplasm 272 95 confid interv ci 231314 nf1 individu 50 4060 comparison moreov cumul incid second primari neoplasm 211 144278 nf1 individu 64 00150 comparison 20 year first neoplasm person born nf1 698 656742 probabl aliv without neoplasm histori age 50 compar 935 924946 person without nf1 conclus highli increas risk primari secondari neoplasm mortal warrant close clinic surveil individu nf1
cancer,"Anemia is highly prevalent among oncological patients and is often managed with red blood cell transfusions. Current guidelines predominantly rely on hemoglobin levels to guide transfusion, but hemoglobin alone may not accurately reflect oxygen delivery. Physiological triggers, particularly the oxygen extraction ratio (O(2)ER), could provide a more individualized transfusion strategy. This prospective, single-center, observational study included 107 clinically stable adult oncology patients at the Kazakh Institute of Oncology and Radiology. All patients required red blood cell transfusion based on a restrictive trigger (Hb 70 g/L). Patients were stratified into two groups according to their baseline O(2)ER (</= 35.4% or > 35.4%). The primary outcome was the change in O(2)ER before and one hour after transfusion. We also measured changes in central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO(2)), central venous oxygen partial pressure (PvO(2)), arteriovenous oxygen difference (A-V O(2)diff), lactate, and veno-arterial carbon dioxide difference (DeltaCO(2)). Patients with higher baseline oxygen extraction ratio (O(2)ER > 35.4%) demonstrated more pronounced improvements in oxygenation parameters-including O(2)ER, ScvO(2), PvO(2), A‑V O(2) diff, and DeltaCO(2)-following transfusion, compared to patients with O(2)ER </= 35.4%. Although baseline hemoglobin levels and post-transfusion increases in hemoglobin were similar between groups, significant differences were observed across all physiological markers of oxygen transport. Correlation analyses showed significant associations between baseline O(2)ER and changes in PvO(2), ScvO(2), A‑V O(2) diff, DeltaCO(2), and lactate. In contrast, baseline hemoglobin demonstrated no significant correlations with most physiological response parameters, except for a moderate but statistically significant correlation with the change in blood lactate levels. Lactate levels remained within normal limits in the majority of patients, indicating that critical oxygen delivery thresholds were not reached. In stable cancer patients with anemia, hemoglobin levels alone may not adequately capture oxygen delivery status. The oxygen extraction ratio and other physiological triggers offer valuable insights into which patients may benefit most from transfusion. Our findings support a more individualized transfusion strategy, though larger randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm the safety and efficacy of physiological triggers in broader patient populations.Trial Registration The study protocol was retrospectively registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06952361, Initial Release 04/23/2025).",anemia highli preval among oncolog patient often manag red blood cell transfus current guidelin predominantli reli hemoglobin level guid transfus hemoglobin alon may accur reflect oxygen deliveri physiolog trigger particularli oxygen extract ratio o2er could provid individu transfus strategi prospect singlecent observ studi includ 107 clinic stabl adult oncolog patient kazakh institut oncolog radiolog patient requir red blood cell transfus base restrict trigger hb 70 gl patient stratifi two group accord baselin o2er 354 354 primari outcom chang o2er one hour transfus also measur chang central venou oxygen satur scvo2 central venou oxygen partial pressur pvo2 arterioven oxygen differ av o2diff lactat venoarteri carbon dioxid differ deltaco2 patient higher baselin oxygen extract ratio o2er 354 demonstr pronounc improv oxygen parametersinclud o2er scvo2 pvo2 a‑v o2 diff deltaco2follow transfus compar patient o2er 354 although baselin hemoglobin level posttransfus increas hemoglobin similar group signific differ observ across physiolog marker oxygen transport correl analys show signific associ baselin o2er chang pvo2 scvo2 a‑v o2 diff deltaco2 lactat contrast baselin hemoglobin demonstr signific correl physiolog respons paramet except moder statist signific correl chang blood lactat level lactat level remain within normal limit major patient indic critic oxygen deliveri threshold reach stabl cancer patient anemia hemoglobin level alon may adequ captur oxygen deliveri statu oxygen extract ratio physiolog trigger offer valuabl insight patient may benefit transfus find support individu transfus strategi though larger random control trial warrant confirm safeti efficaci physiolog trigger broader patient populationstri registr studi protocol retrospect regist clinicaltrialsgov nct06952361 initi releas 04232025
cancer,"PURPOSE: The expansion of digital health offers a promising avenue to improve care delivery and optimize treatment outcomes. This study evaluated telehealth utilization and its impact on endocrine therapy adherence, clinical outcomes, and healthcare costs. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used claims data from the Merative MarketScan database. Eligible patients were females under 65 years old who were diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer in 2018 and maintained commercial insurance for one year pre-diagnosis and five years post-endocrine therapy initiation. Telehealth utilization was assessed as a binary (user vs. nonuser) measure. Primary outcomes were endocrine therapy adherence, metastasis incidence, and patient-incurred healthcare costs. Associations between telehealth and outcomes were tested using generalized linear models. RESULTS: Among 1,141 eligible patients (mean age: 51 years), 874 (77%) used telehealth, totaling 8,350 visits over five years. Telehealth utilization was consistent across age groups and insurance plans but varied significantly by geographic region, urban-rural status, comorbidity burden, and endocrine therapy regimen. Telehealth use was significantly associated with better adherence (adjusted odds ratio = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.31-1.91; p < 0.0001) but not with metastasis rates. Notably, telehealth users incurred 15% higher out-of-pocket medical costs compared to nonusers (p < 0.0001), though prescription costs did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrate telehealth benefits for long-term adherence to endocrine therapy among commercially insured women under 65 with breast cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Telehealth may help breast cancer survivors stay adherent to endocrine therapy, but its financial burden could limit accessibility and equity in oncology care.",purpos expans digit health offer promis avenu improv care deliveri optim treatment outcom studi evalu telehealth util impact endocrin therapi adher clinic outcom healthcar cost method retrospect cohort studi use claim data mer marketscan databas elig patient femal 65 year old diagnos nonmetastat breast cancer 2018 maintain commerci insur one year prediagnosi five year postendocrin therapi initi telehealth util assess binari user vs nonus measur primari outcom endocrin therapi adher metastasi incid patientincur healthcar cost associ telehealth outcom test use gener linear model result among 1141 elig patient mean age 51 year 874 77 use telehealth total 8350 visit five year telehealth util consist across age group insur plan vari significantli geograph region urbanrur statu comorbid burden endocrin therapi regimen telehealth use significantli associ better adher adjust odd ratio 158 95 ci 131191 p 00001 metastasi rate notabl telehealth user incur 15 higher outofpocket medic cost compar nonus p 00001 though prescript cost differ significantli conclus find demonstr telehealth benefit longterm adher endocrin therapi among commerci insur women 65 breast cancer implic cancer survivor telehealth may help breast cancer survivor stay adher endocrin therapi financi burden could limit access equiti oncolog care
cancer,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to examine smoking-related work productivity loss among working-age cancer survivors. METHODS: The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS; 2013-2019 and 2022-2023) data were used to identify cancer survivors ages 18-64 years. The sample was stratified by smoking status (currently smoke, formerly smoked, and never smoked). Multivariable generalized linear regressions were conducted to examine the associations of smoking status and work productivity loss measures, including labor force participation, inability to work due to health, and any missed workdays (logistic models), and number of missed workdays (negative binomial models). All analyses controlled for sociodemographic characteristics, survey year, and region, accounting for the complex survey design. RESULTS: In total, 8203 (weighted n = 7,048,624) cancer survivors were identified, of whom 1793 (weighted n = 1,387,882; 19.7%) currently smoke, 2189 (weighted n = 1,889,235; 26.5%) formerly smoked, and 4221 (weighted n = 3,771,507; 53.5%) never smoked. In adjusted analyses, the labor force participation rate was similar by smoking status. Survivors who currently smoke were more likely to report an inability to work due to health reasons than those who never smoked (23.9% vs. 18.0%, p < 0.001). Among working cancer survivors (n = 5320), those who currently smoke were more likely to report any missed workdays than those who never smoked (59.7% vs. 53.8%, p = 0.016) and experienced a higher number of missed workdays than those who formerly smoked (13.1 vs. 9.9 days, p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: About one-fifth of working-age cancer survivors report currently smoking, and smoking status is associated with health-related work productivity loss.

cancer,"Traditional segmentation networks treat anatomical structures as isolated elements, often neglecting their hierarchical relationships. This study introduces Softmax for Arbitrary Label Trees (SALT), a novel method that leverages these hierarchical connections to improve segmentation efficiency and interpretability. SALT is a novel activation function that extends the softmax to arbitrary hierarchical label trees by modeling conditional probabilities along parent-child relations in imaging data. This enables anatomical hierarchies in CT imaging to be represented naturally, allowing segmentations to propagate from broader regions to detailed structures. Using the SAROS dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), which comprises 900 body segmentations from 883 patients and was enhanced by TotalSegmentator to include 113 anatomical labels, the model was trained on 600 scans, with validation and testing on 150. Dice scores across SAROS, CT-ORG, FLARE22, LCTSC, LUNA16, and WORD datasets measured performance, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) from 1000 bootstrapping rounds. SALT achieved top performance on the LUNA16 and SAROS datasets, with Dice scores of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.919-0.938) and 0.929 (95% CI: 0.924-0.933). Reliable accuracy was also observed in CT-ORG (0.891, 95% CI: 0.869-0.906), FLARE22 (0.849, 95% CI: 0.844-0.854), LCTSC (0.908, 95% CI: 0.902-0.914), and WORD (0.844, 95% CI: 0.839-0.85). SALT can segment a 1000-slice CT in 35 s. By leveraging hierarchical body structures, SALT enables rapid whole-body segmentation, processing CT scans in 35 s on average. This capability supports its integration into clinical workflows, enhancing efficiency in automated full-body segmentation and contributing to improved diagnostic workflows and patient care.",tradit segment network treat anatom structur isol element often neglect hierarch relationship studi introduc softmax arbitrari label tree salt novel method leverag hierarch connect improv segment effici interpret salt novel activ function extend softmax arbitrari hierarch label tree model condit probabl along parentchild relat imag data enabl anatom hierarchi ct imag repres natur allow segment propag broader region detail structur use saro dataset cancer imag archiv tcia compris 900 bodi segment 883 patient enhanc totalsegment includ 113 anatom label model train 600 scan valid test 150 dice score across saro ctorg flare22 lctsc luna16 word dataset measur perform 95 confid interv ci 1000 bootstrap round salt achiev top perform luna16 saro dataset dice score 093 95 ci 09190938 0929 95 ci 09240933 reliabl accuraci also observ ctorg 0891 95 ci 08690906 flare22 0849 95 ci 08440854 lctsc 0908 95 ci 09020914 word 0844 95 ci 0839085 salt segment 1000slice ct 35 leverag hierarch bodi structur salt enabl rapid wholebodi segment process ct scan 35 averag capabl support integr clinic workflow enhanc effici autom fullbodi segment contribut improv diagnost workflow patient care
cancer,"Surgery is the primary treatment for early-stage lung cancer. Adjuvant therapy is offered to patients who are at a high risk of recurrence, however, determining the patients that would benefit from additional therapy is often difficult. In this study, we aimed to develop a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for post-surgery lung cancer prognostication integrating a multi-modality deep learning model (DLM). Pre-operative medical images and clinical, surgical, and pathological information were fed into an externally validated DLM. A CDSS was then developed to display the patient information and DLM results for potential clinical use. Four oncologists evaluated each patient's recurrence probability, their confidence level, and their post-surgery recommendations both with and without the DLM information. The CDSS DLM information demonstrated the potential to improve user prediction performance and confidence. This exploratory study is the first to integrate a multi-modality DLM for prognostication with a CDSS, as well as the first study of clinician attitudes towards CDSSs for lung cancer.",surgeri primari treatment earlystag lung cancer adjuv therapi offer patient high risk recurr howev determin patient would benefit addit therapi often difficult studi aim develop clinic decis support system cdss postsurgeri lung cancer prognost integr multimod deep learn model dlm preoper medic imag clinic surgic patholog inform fed extern valid dlm cdss develop display patient inform dlm result potenti clinic use four oncologist evalu patient recurr probabl confid level postsurgeri recommend without dlm inform cdss dlm inform demonstr potenti improv user predict perform confid exploratori studi first integr multimod dlm prognost cdss well first studi clinician attitud toward cdsss lung cancer

cancer,"This study presents a novel electrochemical immunosensor designed for the highly sensitive detection of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The sensor utilizes gold nanostructures grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes through a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated electrochemical process. Fabrication involves a two-step immobilization strategy, combining physical vapor deposition (PVD) of a gold thin film with thermal annealing. The nanostructured electrode is subsequently modified electrochemically via PEG mediation, followed by antibody functionalization to enhance binding specificity. PEG-mediated control over nanostructure growth yields irregular short nanorods and leaf-like dendrites, significantly enhancing sensor performance. Extensive electrochemical analyses, including cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy, confirm improved sensitivity and stability. The optimized immunosensor achieves an ultralow detection limit of 6 fg/mL (corresponding to ~ 9500 VEGF molecules in 60 microL, and a broad linear detection range of 10 fg/mL to 10(5) fg/mL, with excellent reproducibility. Given VEGF's pivotal role in angiogenesis and tumor progression, this ultrasensitive platform offers a promising tool for early cancer diagnostics.",studi present novel electrochem immunosensor design highli sensit detect vascular endotheli growth factor vegf sensor util gold nanostructur grown fluorinedop tin oxid fto electrod polyethylen glycol pegmedi electrochem process fabric involv twostep immobil strategi combin physic vapor deposit pvd gold thin film thermal anneal nanostructur electrod subsequ modifi electrochem via peg mediat follow antibodi function enhanc bind specif pegmedi control nanostructur growth yield irregular short nanorod leaflik dendrit significantli enhanc sensor perform extens electrochem analys includ cyclic voltammetri imped spectroscopi confirm improv sensit stabil optim immunosensor achiev ultralow detect limit 6 fgml correspond 9500 vegf molecul 60 microl broad linear detect rang 10 fgml 105 fgml excel reproduc given vegf pivot role angiogenesi tumor progress ultrasensit platform offer promis tool earli cancer diagnost
cancer,"We investigated the role of the intraperitoneal immune microenvironment in the therapeutic response of gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis to intraperitoneal paclitaxel. Gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis has a poor prognosis, even with systemic chemotherapy. Although intraperitoneal paclitaxel administration has demonstrated clinical benefit, treatment resistance remains a major hurdle. Between 2017 and 2023, 30 patients undergoing staging laparoscopy were prospectively enrolled. Immune cell subsets and checkpoint marker expression in peritoneal lavage fluid were analyzed using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Their associations with clinical outcomes were assessed using univariable and multivariable analyses, including Kaplan-Meier, logistic regression, and Ridge regression analyses. Elevated CD4(+) T and CD19(+) B cell levels were associated with inferior progression-free survival, whereas increased natural killer T-like cell levels correlated with improved survival. High FOXP3 and CTLA-4 expression were linked to worse outcomes. Ridge regression identified CD4(+) T cell levels and CTLA-4 expression as unfavorable factors, while the presence of natural killer cells emerged as a favorable factor. An immunoregulatory-dominant immune landscape may drive resistance to intraperitoneal paclitaxel. Immune profiling of ascitic fluid could identify patients likely to benefit from immune-modulating strategies, including those targeting FOXP3(+) and CTLA-4(+) regulatory cells.",investig role intraperiton immun microenviron therapeut respons gastric cancer periton metastasi intraperiton paclitaxel gastric cancer periton metastasi poor prognosi even system chemotherapi although intraperiton paclitaxel administr demonstr clinic benefit treatment resist remain major hurdl 2017 2023 30 patient undergo stage laparoscopi prospect enrol immun cell subset checkpoint marker express periton lavag fluid analyz use flow cytometri immunohistochemistri associ clinic outcom assess use univari multivari analys includ kaplanmei logist regress ridg regress analys elev cd4 cd19 b cell level associ inferior progressionfre surviv wherea increas natur killer tlike cell level correl improv surviv high foxp3 ctla4 express link wors outcom ridg regress identifi cd4 cell level ctla4 express unfavor factor presenc natur killer cell emerg favor factor immunoregulatorydomin immun landscap may drive resist intraperiton paclitaxel immun profil ascit fluid could identifi patient like benefit immunemodul strategi includ target foxp3 ctla4 regulatori cell
cancer,"Breast cancer is a serious health concern and one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. The early diagnosis of breast cancer is crucial for successful treatment and improved patient outcomes. Advanced computational techniques, particularly deep transfer learning have gained considerable attention for their effectiveness in medical image computing. Initially, six transfer learning models with different specifications are trained, validated and tested on the breast ultrasound image dataset. Additionally, a novel hybrid model, DRM-Net, is developed by stacking the top three TL models based on concatenation and flattening of deep dense layers. Various techniques, including image preprocessing, image masking, data augmentation, and hyperparameter tuning, are incorporated to enhance the overall performance of the considered models. The models are thoroughly evaluated using various standard metrics and statistical methods. Furthermore, to ensure transparent decision-making, the proposed model is interpreted using XAI-based class activation mapping (CAM) method with different versions. The proposed DRM-Net model demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to the other six transfer learning models. Among all the models, DRM-Net achieved the highest overall performance, with an accuracy of 96.71%, precision of 96%, recall of 97%, F1-score of 97%, and an AUC value of 99%, respectively. It also outperformed state-of-the-art similar studies in the literature. The experimental results demonstrate the potential utility of the hybrid DRM-Net model in improving the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis, which could facilitate informed clinical decision-making. The proposed model can also be applied to other diseases where ultrasound imaging is available.",breast cancer seriou health concern one lead caus cancerrel death among women worldwid earli diagnosi breast cancer crucial success treatment improv patient outcom advanc comput techniqu particularli deep transfer learn gain consider attent effect medic imag comput initi six transfer learn model differ specif train valid test breast ultrasound imag dataset addit novel hybrid model drmnet develop stack top three tl model base concaten flatten deep dens layer variou techniqu includ imag preprocess imag mask data augment hyperparamet tune incorpor enhanc overal perform consid model model thoroughli evalu use variou standard metric statist method furthermor ensur transpar decisionmak propos model interpret use xaibas class activ map cam method differ version propos drmnet model demonstr superior predict perform compar six transfer learn model among model drmnet achiev highest overal perform accuraci 9671 precis 96 recal 97 f1score 97 auc valu 99 respect also outperform stateoftheart similar studi literatur experiment result demonstr potenti util hybrid drmnet model improv accuraci breast cancer diagnosi could facilit inform clinic decisionmak propos model also appli diseas ultrasound imag avail
cancer,"Oxidative/nitrosative stresses, common characters of inflamed/cancer tissues, produce reactive oxygen/nitrogen species that alter guanine, such as 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-hydroxy-dG)-a lesion highly involved in carcinogenesis. Although its biological relevance is established, structural impact of such lesions remains partially clarified. Here, reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations have been used for examining spatial distribution of the hydroxylated guanines dictates canonical B-DNA's 3D structure towards canonical B-DNA structure. Through the Dickerson-Drew dodecamer, a standard, five schemes of hydroxylation have been modeled, such as global (MtOH), site-visited (MdOH, MlOH), and orientation-dependent terminal schemes (Ml2r14OH, Ml2r24OH). Five helical deformation descriptors-center-of-base-pair distance (COBP), propeller twist angle (PTA), global/local twist angle (GTA/LTA), and end-to-end DNA length-were obtained from equilibrium trajectory for encoding local/global disturbances structure quantitatively. The results display a clear-cut priority of deformation: fully hydroxylated duplexes display isotropic elongation and wide unwinding, while vertically assembled terminal lesions retain almost native helical structure, oppositely cross-axis lesions, which impose collaborative end-fraying with wide alterations. The results illustrate that more than lesion occurrence, positional symmetry decisively dictates the stability of DNA, giving mechanistic information relevant for mutagenesis, genome instability, and pathogenetic processes under oxidative stress.",oxidativenitros stress common charact inflamedcanc tissu produc reactiv oxygennitrogen speci alter guanin 8hydroxy2deoxyguanosin 8hydroxydga lesion highli involv carcinogenesi although biolog relev establish structur impact lesion remain partial clarifi reactiv molecular dynam rmd simul use examin spatial distribut hydroxyl guanin dictat canon bdna 3d structur toward canon bdna structur dickersondrew dodecam standard five scheme hydroxyl model global mtoh sitevisit mdoh mloh orientationdepend termin scheme ml2r14oh ml2r24oh five helic deform descriptorscenterofbasepair distanc cobp propel twist angl pta globalloc twist angl gtalta endtoend dna lengthwer obtain equilibrium trajectori encod localglob disturb structur quantit result display clearcut prioriti deform fulli hydroxyl duplex display isotrop elong wide unwind vertic assembl termin lesion retain almost nativ helic structur opposit crossaxi lesion impos collabor endfray wide alter result illustr lesion occurr posit symmetri decis dictat stabil dna give mechanist inform relev mutagenesi genom instabl pathogenet process oxid stress
cancer,"Breast cancer is the most common non-skin related malignancy and the leading cause of cancer death in women. Mammography remains the gold standard for early detection; however, its accessibility is limited in low-resource settings due to cost and technical complexity. Ultrasound (US) is a viable alternative, but its implementation is hindered by the scarcity of trained radiologists and sonographers. Volume sweep imaging (VSI) has addressed the issue of US acquisition by enabling non-specialists to perform standardized scans. However, these still require expert interpretation, limiting their impact. To overcome this barrier, we propose a fully automated Breast VSI (VSI-B) system integrating artificial intelligence (AI) for segmentation and classification of breast lesions, aiming to provide an accessible diagnostic tool for low-resource environments. This study developed an AI-driven diagnostic system for VSI-B, combining a segmentation model (Attention U-Net 3D) with a classification model for lesion detection. A total of 98 patients with palpable breast lumps were included in the study. The dataset consisted of 392 VSI-B US videos and 2,100 classified frames. A new method was implemented to enhance mass identification by selecting key frames for analysis. A majority voting algorithm was used to optimize lesion classification. The system's performance was assessed based on sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Following a detection step that achieved 100% sensitivity and 93.6% specificity for cancer and no cancer patients, as well as 95.0% sensitivity and 63.0% specificity for mass and no mass patients, the DenseNet classification model reached 87% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 83% specificity. A majority voting algorithm optimized classification, yielding an AUC of 0.91. This study highlights the potential of an AI-enabled VSI-B system as a reliable diagnostic tool in low-resource settings. By integrating multi-modal segmentation and classification, the system automates breast lesion detection and stratification, reducing reliance on radiologists. The results suggest that this approach could enhance early breast cancer diagnosis and guide clinical decision-making, particularly in underserved regions.",breast cancer common nonskin relat malign lead caus cancer death women mammographi remain gold standard earli detect howev access limit lowresourc set due cost technic complex ultrasound us viabl altern implement hinder scarciti train radiologist sonograph volum sweep imag vsi address issu us acquisit enabl nonspecialist perform standard scan howev still requir expert interpret limit impact overcom barrier propos fulli autom breast vsi vsib system integr artifici intellig ai segment classif breast lesion aim provid access diagnost tool lowresourc environ studi develop aidriven diagnost system vsib combin segment model attent unet 3d classif model lesion detect total 98 patient palpabl breast lump includ studi dataset consist 392 vsib us video 2100 classifi frame new method implement enhanc mass identif select key frame analysi major vote algorithm use optim lesion classif system perform assess base sensit specif accuraci follow detect step achiev 100 sensit 936 specif cancer cancer patient well 950 sensit 630 specif mass mass patient densenet classif model reach 87 accuraci 100 sensit 83 specif major vote algorithm optim classif yield auc 091 studi highlight potenti aienabl vsib system reliabl diagnost tool lowresourc set integr multimod segment classif system autom breast lesion detect stratif reduc relianc radiologist result suggest approach could enhanc earli breast cancer diagnosi guid clinic decisionmak particularli underserv region
cancer,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) exhibits significant heterogeneity in clinical outcomes, influenced by histology, age, stage, and molecular characteristics. This study aimed to develop and validate a comprehensive model integrating demographic, clinical, and molecular data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to predict two-year survival outcomes in EOC. The cohort included 2,427 patients with Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma (EA)s and Serous Cystadenocarcinoma (SC) , of whom 1,011 had gene data. Machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated for predictive performance. SVM provided the optimal balance of mortality-class detection and overall performance. While GBC achieved the highest ROC-AUC (0.81), SVM demonstrated superior recall for mortality cases (0.70 vs. 0.61), which was prioritized given our clinical objective. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analyses revealed that WT1, HOXA11, TPM4, TMPRSS2, MUC16, SDHD, and MYC were the most influential predictors of mortality, along with age at diagnosis. Differential gene expression and enrichment analyses identified distinct age- and stage-associated molecular profiles, with genes involved in cell cycle regulation, tumor microenvironment, and growth factor signaling showing significant upregulation. Mutational analyses revealed histology-specific patterns, with TP53, PIK3CA, and ZFHX3 highly mutated in SC, while PTEN and ARID1A were more prevalent in EA. Several mutations, including TP53, FAT3, and FAT4 in EA, and CSMD3 in SC, were associated with poorer survival. Integrating multivariate predictive modeling with biological interpretation provides a comprehensive framework for personalized risk stratification and treatment decision-making in EOC. The identified prognostic biomarkers, such as TPM4, SDHD, MUC16, and BCL6, represent potential targets for future studies and therapeutic interventions.",epitheli ovarian cancer eoc exhibit signific heterogen clinic outcom influenc histolog age stage molecular characterist studi aim develop valid comprehens model integr demograph clinic molecular data cancer genom atla tcga predict twoyear surviv outcom eoc cohort includ 2427 patient endometrioid adenocarcinoma ea serou cystadenocarcinoma sc 1011 gene data machin learn model includ logist regress gradient boost classifi gbc support vector machin svm random forest train evalu predict perform svm provid optim balanc mortalityclass detect overal perform gbc achiev highest rocauc 081 svm demonstr superior recal mortal case 070 vs 061 priorit given clinic object shapley addit explan shap analys reveal wt1 hoxa11 tpm4 tmprss2 muc16 sdhd myc influenti predictor mortal along age diagnosi differenti gene express enrich analys identifi distinct age stageassoci molecular profil gene involv cell cycl regul tumor microenviron growth factor signal show signific upregul mutat analys reveal histologyspecif pattern tp53 pik3ca zfhx3 highli mutat sc pten arid1a preval ea sever mutat includ tp53 fat3 fat4 ea csmd3 sc associ poorer surviv integr multivari predict model biolog interpret provid comprehens framework person risk stratif treatment decisionmak eoc identifi prognost biomark tpm4 sdhd muc16 bcl6 repres potenti target futur studi therapeut intervent
cancer,"Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women, with hormone receptor-positive (HR + ) disease representing the majority of cases. Despite advances in targeted therapies and antibody-drug conjugates, resistance to treatment remains a significant challenge, necessitating innovative therapeutic strategies. Epigenetic dysregulation, particularly involving histone acetylation, plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and therapy resistance. Lysine acetyltransferase 6 (KAT6A/B), key regulators of chromatin structure and gene expression, have emerged as promising therapeutic targets in HR+ breast cancer. This review highlights the molecular mechanisms by which KAT6A/B modulate histone acetylation and gene regulation, emphasizing their roles in oncogenic pathways and cellular processes such as transcriptional activation, chromatin remodeling, and regulation of cellular senescence. We discuss preclinical evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of KAT6 inhibition and the challenges faced in epigenetic drug development, including the need for robust biomarker-driven approaches. Finally, we explore the prospects for integrating KAT6 inhibitors with existing therapies to overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes in breast cancer.",breast cancer lead caus cancerrel mortal among women hormon receptorposit hr diseas repres major case despit advanc target therapi antibodydrug conjug resist treatment remain signific challeng necessit innov therapeut strategi epigenet dysregul particularli involv histon acetyl play crucial role tumorigenesi therapi resist lysin acetyltransferas 6 kat6ab key regul chromatin structur gene express emerg promis therapeut target hr breast cancer review highlight molecular mechan kat6ab modul histon acetyl gene regul emphas role oncogen pathway cellular process transcript activ chromatin remodel regul cellular senesc discuss preclin evid support therapeut potenti kat6 inhibit challeng face epigenet drug develop includ need robust biomarkerdriven approach final explor prospect integr kat6 inhibitor exist therapi overcom resist improv patient outcom breast cancer
cancer,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has vast potential for improving healthcare delivery, but concerns regarding biases in these systems have raised important questions regarding fairness when deployed clinically. Most prior studies on fairness in clinical AI focus solely on performance disparities between subpopulations, which often fall short of connecting the technical outputs of AI systems with sociotechnical outcomes. In this work, we present a simulation-based approach to explore how statistical definitions of algorithmic fairness translate to fairness in long-term outcomes, using AI-assisted breast cancer screening as a case example. We evaluate four fairness criteria and their impact on mortality rates and socioeconomic disparities, while also considering how clinical decision makers' reliance on AI and patients' access to healthcare affect outcomes. Our results highlight how algorithmic fairness does not directly translate into fair and equitable outcomes, underscoring the importance of integrating sociotechnical perspectives to gain a holistic understanding of fairness in healthcare AI.",artifici intellig ai vast potenti improv healthcar deliveri concern regard bias system rais import question regard fair deploy clinic prior studi fair clinic ai focu sole perform dispar subpopul often fall short connect technic output ai system sociotechn outcom work present simulationbas approach explor statist definit algorithm fair translat fair longterm outcom use aiassist breast cancer screen case exampl evalu four fair criteria impact mortal rate socioeconom dispar also consid clinic decis maker relianc ai patient access healthcar affect outcom result highlight algorithm fair directli translat fair equit outcom underscor import integr sociotechn perspect gain holist understand fair healthcar ai
cancer,"Mitochondrial hyperfunction is important for cervical cancer progression. Solute carrier family 30 member 9 (SLC30A9) is a member of the solute carrier family 30, specifically a zinc transporter that plays a critical role in mitochondrial zinc homeostasis and maintaining mitochondrial function. We investigated the expression, function, and underlying mechanisms of SLC30A9 in the context of cervical cancer. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed a marked overexpression of SLC30A9 within the malignant epithelial cell population of cervical squamous cell carcinoma. This elevated SLC30A9 expression was further corroborated in clinical specimens from local patients and across various established and primary cervical cancer cells. SLC30A9 shRNA or knockout (via CRISPR/Cas9 method) significantly impeded the viability, proliferation, cell cycle progression and migration, and triggered apoptosis in cervical cancer cells. SLC30A9 depletion disrupted mitochondrial function, inhibiting mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial complex I activity, and ATP production, also caused mitochondrial Zn(2+) accumulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative injury. Conversely, overexpression of SLC30A9 in cervical cancer cells demonstrated enhanced mitochondrial complex I activity, increased ATP production, and augmented cellular proliferation and migration. Bioinformatic analysis, coupled with functional validation, identified PRDM1 (PR Domain Containing 1) as a key transcription factor regulating SLC30A9 expression. Silencing or knockout of PRDM1 resulted in a significant reduction in SLC30A9 promoter activity, as well as decreased SLC30A9 mRNA and protein levels in primary cervical cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirmed increased PRDM1 binding to the SLC30A9 promoter region in cervical cancer tissues. In vivo studies showed that SLC30A9 knockdown led to a remarkable decrease in the growth of xenografts formed by primary cervical cancer cells. These SLC30A9-silenced xenografts exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction, proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction. These findings collectively suggest that PRDM1-driven SLC30A9 overexpression significantly contributes to the malignant phenotype of cervical cancer, possibly through promoting mitochondrial hyperfunction.",mitochondri hyperfunct import cervic cancer progress solut carrier famili 30 member 9 slc30a9 member solut carrier famili 30 specif zinc transport play critic role mitochondri zinc homeostasi maintain mitochondri function investig express function underli mechan slc30a9 context cervic cancer singlecel rna sequenc analysi reveal mark overexpress slc30a9 within malign epitheli cell popul cervic squamou cell carcinoma elev slc30a9 express corrobor clinic specimen local patient across variou establish primari cervic cancer cell slc30a9 shrna knockout via crisprcas9 method significantli imped viabil prolifer cell cycl progress migrat trigger apoptosi cervic cancer cell slc30a9 deplet disrupt mitochondri function inhibit mitochondri respir mitochondri membran potenti mitochondri complex activ atp product also caus mitochondri zn2 accumul reactiv oxygen speci ro product oxid injuri convers overexpress slc30a9 cervic cancer cell demonstr enhanc mitochondri complex activ increas atp product augment cellular prolifer migrat bioinformat analysi coupl function valid identifi prdm1 pr domain contain 1 key transcript factor regul slc30a9 express silenc knockout prdm1 result signific reduct slc30a9 promot activ well decreas slc30a9 mrna protein level primari cervic cancer cell chromatin immunoprecipit chip assay confirm increas prdm1 bind slc30a9 promot region cervic cancer tissu vivo studi show slc30a9 knockdown led remark decreas growth xenograft form primari cervic cancer cell slc30a9silenc xenograft exhibit mitochondri dysfunct prolifer inhibit apoptosi induct find collect suggest prdm1driven slc30a9 overexpress significantli contribut malign phenotyp cervic cancer possibl promot mitochondri hyperfunct
cancer,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as pivotal regulators driving cancer development and potential therapeutic targets across multiple human malignancies. However, their mechanistic roles during head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) initiation and progression remain incompletely elucidated. Here, we identified a novel oncogenic lncRNA, LINC00973, which was aberrantly upregulated in clinical samples and associated with aggressive clinicopathological features and adverse clinical outcomes. LINC00973 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and inhibited cell apoptosis and senescence in vitro, and induced tumor growth and lymph node metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC00973 functioned as a molecular sponge for tumor-suppressive miR-6756-3p, consequently stabilizing transcription factor Engrailed-2 (EN2) mRNA and activating NOTCH pathway to promote HNSCC progression. Integrative epigenomics/transcriptomics analyses coupled with molecular assays revealed a proximal super-enhancer (SE) within the LINC00973 locus, which recruited Activator Protein 1 (AP-1)/FOS Like 1 (FOSL1), BRD4, and EP300, thereby collectively activating its transcription. CRISPR interference assay identified four functional enhancer elements of LINC00973-SE and H3K27ac HiChIP data analysis suggested enhancer-promoter contacts, collectively contributing to LINC00973 transcription. Clinically, the abundance of LINC00973, miR-6756-3p, EN2, and NOTCH1 in HNSCC samples was correlated and significantly associated with patients' survival. Collectively, our findings revealed a hitherto uncharacterized SE-driven LINC00973-miR-6756-3p-EN2 regulatory axis to facilitate HNSCC progression and highlighted LINC00973 as a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target with considerable translational potential.",long noncod rna lncrna emerg pivot regul drive cancer develop potenti therapeut target across multipl human malign howev mechanist role head neck squamou cell carcinoma hnscc initi progress remain incomplet elucid identifi novel oncogen lncrna linc00973 aberrantli upregul clinic sampl associ aggress clinicopatholog featur advers clinic outcom linc00973 promot cell prolifer migrat invas inhibit cell apoptosi senesc vitro induc tumor growth lymph node metastasi vivo mechanist linc00973 function molecular spong tumorsuppress mir67563p consequ stabil transcript factor engrailed2 en2 mrna activ notch pathway promot hnscc progress integr epigenomicstranscriptom analys coupl molecular assay reveal proxim superenhanc se within linc00973 locu recruit activ protein 1 ap1fo like 1 fosl1 brd4 ep300 therebi collect activ transcript crispr interfer assay identifi four function enhanc element linc00973s h3k27ac hichip data analysi suggest enhancerpromot contact collect contribut linc00973 transcript clinic abund linc00973 mir67563p en2 notch1 hnscc sampl correl significantli associ patient surviv collect find reveal hitherto uncharacter sedriven linc00973mir67563pen2 regulatori axi facilit hnscc progress highlight linc00973 promis prognost biomark therapeut target consider translat potenti
cancer,"Clinical efficacy of anti-PD1 immunotherapy often yields low response rates in Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC). To gain insights into immune escape mechanisms and discover critical molecules in anti-tumor immunity, we performed an immune checkpoint screening using transcriptome profiling and immunohistochemistry analyses. We identified CD276 as an independent immunosuppressive molecule that correlates with poor EBVaGC prognosis. Our in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate the role of CD276 in inducing T cell apoptosis and diminishing chemokine secretion, thereby dampening immune response and facilitating tumor progression. Mechanistically, we discovered that YAP/TEAD4 chromatin occupancy at CD276 regulatory regions leads to its transcriptional upregulation in EBVaGC, driven by EBNA1-stimulated MST1/2-LATS1/2-YAP signaling. Notably, in a humanized xenograft mouse model, EBVaGC with elevated CD276 levels exhibited resistance to anti-PD1 immunotherapy, while targeting CD276 in combination with PD1 blockade significantly reduced tumor size. Collectively, our findings elucidate the EBNA1-YAP-CD276 axis as a novel mechanism of immune escape in EBVaGC, providing insights for enhanced immunotherapeutic strategies.",clinic efficaci antipd1 immunotherapi often yield low respons rate epsteinbarr virusassoci gastric cancer ebvagc gain insight immun escap mechan discov critic molecul antitumor immun perform immun checkpoint screen use transcriptom profil immunohistochemistri analys identifi cd276 independ immunosuppress molecul correl poor ebvagc prognosi vitro vivo experi demonstr role cd276 induc cell apoptosi diminish chemokin secret therebi dampen immun respons facilit tumor progress mechanist discov yaptead4 chromatin occup cd276 regulatori region lead transcript upregul ebvagc driven ebna1stimul mst12lats12yap signal notabl human xenograft mous model ebvagc elev cd276 level exhibit resist antipd1 immunotherapi target cd276 combin pd1 blockad significantli reduc tumor size collect find elucid ebna1yapcd276 axi novel mechan immun escap ebvagc provid insight enhanc immunotherapeut strategi
cancer,"Although androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies, such as enzalutamide, initially improve outcomes of prostate cancer (PCa) patients, resistance inevitably develops, partly driven by prostate cancer stem-like cells (PCSCs). However, the molecular mechanisms linking the maintenance of PCSCs to enzalutamide resistance (ENZR) remain incompletely elucidated. Here, we implicate Ca(2)(+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 1D (CAMK1D) in PCSC-mediated ENZR. CAMK1D was consistently upregulated in PCa with ENZR and contributed to ENZR by enhancing mitophagy in PCa cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, CAMK1D promotes the expansion of PCSCs by enhancing mitophagy through activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/PINK1 signaling pathway, thereby facilitating cellular adaptation. We revealed that CAMK1D interacts with and phosphorylates AMPK at Thr172, which in turn activates PINK1 to modulate mitophagy, ultimately supporting the expansion of PCSCs under enzalutamide treatment. In a mouse orthotopic PCa model, targeting the CAMK1D/AMPK pathway with the siCAM/HLNP nanoformulation suppresses tumor growth by depleting the PCSCs population, achieving a synergistic effect with enzalutamide therapy. Our findings identify CAMK1D as a key regulator of ENZR that maintains stemness by orchestrating mitophagy, thereby establishing mitophagy as an important nexus between CAMK1D-mediated ENZR and AMPK-driven PCSC enrichment. Therapeutically, we developed a CAMK1D-targeted approach that potently reverses ENZR and improves treatment responses.",although androgen receptor artarget therapi enzalutamid initi improv outcom prostat cancer pca patient resist inevit develop partli driven prostat cancer stemlik cell pcsc howev molecular mechan link mainten pcsc enzalutamid resist enzr remain incomplet elucid implic ca2calmodulindepend protein kinas 1d camk1d pcscmediat enzr camk1d consist upregul pca enzr contribut enzr enhanc mitophagi pca cell vitro vivo mechanist camk1d promot expans pcsc enhanc mitophagi activ ampactiv protein kinas ampkpink1 signal pathway therebi facilit cellular adapt reveal camk1d interact phosphoryl ampk thr172 turn activ pink1 modul mitophagi ultim support expans pcsc enzalutamid treatment mous orthotop pca model target camk1dampk pathway sicamhlnp nanoformul suppress tumor growth deplet pcsc popul achiev synergist effect enzalutamid therapi find identifi camk1d key regul enzr maintain stem orchestr mitophagi therebi establish mitophagi import nexu camk1dmedi enzr ampkdriven pcsc enrich therapeut develop camk1dtarget approach potent revers enzr improv treatment respons
cancer,"Ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) are key regulators of protein homeostasis and have been implicated in various aspects of cancer development, including colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we investigated the role of USP11 in CRC pathogenesis. RNA-seq analysis of tumor and matched normal tissues from 35 CRC patients identified USP11 as significantly overexpressed in tumor samples. Elevated USP11 expression was correlated with reduced patient survival, suggesting its prognostic significance. Functional experiments using USP11-knockout and USP11-overexpressing CRC cell lines (HCT-15 and HT-29) revealed that USP11 promotes tumor cell proliferation, migration, colony formation, and 3D spheroid growth. Biochemical assays demonstrated that USP11 stabilizes EGFR and TRAF6 by removing K48-linked ubiquitin chains, thereby preventing their proteasomal degradation. These interactions potentiate both EGFR and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways, contributing to CRC tumorigenesis. Loss of USP11 led to significant reductions in EGFR and TRAF6 protein levels, resulting in impaired tumorigenic behavior in vitro and in mouse xenograft models. Furthermore, USP11 deficiency suppressed tumor spheroid formation in response to EGF, HKLM (a TLR2 agonist), and LPS (a TLR4 agonist), whereas USP11 overexpression amplified these effects. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of USP11 with mitoxantrone markedly decreased spheroid growth in both EGFR- and TLR-driven models, supporting its therapeutic potential. Overall, our findings reveal that USP11 contributes to CRC progression by stabilizing EGFR and TRAF6, thereby enhancing oncogenic signaling. These insights identify USP11 as a promising molecular target for CRC treatment and support the repurposing of mitoxantrone as an inhibitor of USP11-driven tumor growth.",ubiquitinspecif proteas usp key regul protein homeostasi implic variou aspect cancer develop includ colorect cancer crc studi investig role usp11 crc pathogenesi rnaseq analysi tumor match normal tissu 35 crc patient identifi usp11 significantli overexpress tumor sampl elev usp11 express correl reduc patient surviv suggest prognost signific function experi use usp11knockout usp11overexpress crc cell line hct15 ht29 reveal usp11 promot tumor cell prolifer migrat coloni format 3d spheroid growth biochem assay demonstr usp11 stabil egfr traf6 remov k48link ubiquitin chain therebi prevent proteasom degrad interact potenti egfr tolllik receptor tlr signal pathway contribut crc tumorigenesi loss usp11 led signific reduct egfr traf6 protein level result impair tumorigen behavior vitro mous xenograft model furthermor usp11 defici suppress tumor spheroid format respons egf hklm tlr2 agonist lp tlr4 agonist wherea usp11 overexpress amplifi effect importantli pharmacolog inhibit usp11 mitoxantron markedli decreas spheroid growth egfr tlrdriven model support therapeut potenti overal find reveal usp11 contribut crc progress stabil egfr traf6 therebi enhanc oncogen signal insight identifi usp11 promis molecular target crc treatment support repurpos mitoxantron inhibitor usp11driven tumor growth
cancer,"RecQ family of DNA helicases play pivotal roles in DNA replication, repair and responses to DNA damage or replication stress. Several human RecQ helicases are defective in diseases associated with chromosomal instability, premature aging and cancer. We recently discovered novel mutations in the RECQL4 gene in glioblastoma (GBM), the most malignant brain tumor in adults. Transcriptomic profiles of GBMs with REQCL4 mutations resembled those in REQCL4 KO glioma cells. We employ structural modelling and biochemical approaches to elucidate impacts of novel mutations on RECQL4 helicase activities. Using recombinant RECQL4(P532S) and RECQL4(R766Q) proteins we demonstrate that P532S substitution reduces the RECQL4 ability to unwind DNA and disrupts DNA-coupled ATP-hydrolysis activity. WT and mutated RECQL4 were overexpressed in RECQL4 KO glioma cells to study interactions with BLM helicases, cell viability and specific responses to UVC- and chemotherapy-induced DNA damage/repair. Overexpression of RECQL4(P532S) or RECQL4(R766Q) variants affected DNA repair and responses to chemotherapeutics in glioma cells, and RECQL4(R766Q) disturbed interactions with the BLM helicase. Our results reveal deleterious consequences of novel RECQL4 mutations in GBMs. The newly identified RECQL4 mutations affect RECQL4 helicases and their interactions with BLM contributing to glioma progression.",recq famili dna helicas play pivot role dna replic repair respons dna damag replic stress sever human recq helicas defect diseas associ chromosom instabl prematur age cancer recent discov novel mutat recql4 gene glioblastoma gbm malign brain tumor adult transcriptom profil gbm reqcl4 mutat resembl reqcl4 ko glioma cell employ structur model biochem approach elucid impact novel mutat recql4 helicas activ use recombin recql4p532 recql4r766q protein demonstr p532 substitut reduc recql4 abil unwind dna disrupt dnacoupl atphydrolysi activ wt mutat recql4 overexpress recql4 ko glioma cell studi interact blm helicas cell viabil specif respons uvc chemotherapyinduc dna damagerepair overexpress recql4p532 recql4r766q variant affect dna repair respons chemotherapeut glioma cell recql4r766q disturb interact blm helicas result reveal deleteri consequ novel recql4 mutat gbm newli identifi recql4 mutat affect recql4 helicas interact blm contribut glioma progress
cancer,"Hypoxia-induced radioresistance presents a major barrier to effective radiotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), while the underlying role of macrophages remaining elusive. In this study, we found that, compared with normoxia-derived tumor exosomes, hypoxia-derived tumor exosomes more potently promoted M2 polarization of macrophages and TGF-beta1/IL-10 secretion via NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit V2 (NDUFV2), as evidenced by the increased mitochondrial functions, including oxidative phosphorylation, ATP levels and mitochondrial membrane potentials, which collectively suppressed macrophage ferroptosis in an NDUFV2-dependent manner. When co-cultured with these exosome-educated macrophages, bystander normoxic NSCLC cells acquired radioresistance, which was attributed to the inhibition of ferroptosis. Notably, NDUFV2-knockdown macrophages abrogated this exosome-induced radioresistance. Mechanistically, IL-10 might be a pivotal signaling messenger rendering radioresistance of bystander normoxic cells. In vivo, hypoxic exosomes also conferred radioresistance to NSCLC xenografts in mice with intact macrophage populations but not in those with macrophage depletion. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that irradiated xenografts treated with hypoxic exosomes exhibited significantly higher expression levels of GPX4, Ki67, HIF1alpha, CD163, and NDUFV2. Furthermore, GPX4 knockdown in xenografts reversed the radioresistance induced by hypoxic exosomes and was associated with reduced infiltration of M2-polarized macrophages, supporting the central role of ferroptosis in macrophage-regulated, hypoxia-induced radioresistance. Clinical tissue microarray analysis further confirmed that NDUFV2 was significantly upregulated in NSCLC tissues and correlated with advanced stages. Collectively, this study disclosed for the first time that hypoxic exosomes suppressed macrophage inflammatory responses and ferroptosis via NDUFV2, thereby enhancing radioresistance in bystander normoxic NSCLC cells.",hypoxiainduc radioresist present major barrier effect radiotherapi nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc underli role macrophag remain elus studi found compar normoxiaderiv tumor exosom hypoxiaderiv tumor exosom potent promot m2 polar macrophag tgfbeta1il10 secret via nadh ubiquinon oxidoreductas core subunit v2 ndufv2 evidenc increas mitochondri function includ oxid phosphoryl atp level mitochondri membran potenti collect suppress macrophag ferroptosi ndufv2depend manner cocultur exosomeeduc macrophag bystand normox nsclc cell acquir radioresist attribut inhibit ferroptosi notabl ndufv2knockdown macrophag abrog exosomeinduc radioresist mechanist il10 might pivot signal messeng render radioresist bystand normox cell vivo hypox exosom also confer radioresist nsclc xenograft mice intact macrophag popul macrophag deplet immunohistochem analysi reveal irradi xenograft treat hypox exosom exhibit significantli higher express level gpx4 ki67 hif1alpha cd163 ndufv2 furthermor gpx4 knockdown xenograft revers radioresist induc hypox exosom associ reduc infiltr m2polar macrophag support central role ferroptosi macrophageregul hypoxiainduc radioresist clinic tissu microarray analysi confirm ndufv2 significantli upregul nsclc tissu correl advanc stage collect studi disclos first time hypox exosom suppress macrophag inflammatori respons ferroptosi via ndufv2 therebi enhanc radioresist bystand normox nsclc cell
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Self-advocacy is essential for cancer patients to obtain high-quality care. However, existing self-advocacy assessment tools-developed by Western scholars-are poorly aligned with the cultural and healthcare context of China. AIM: The study aimed to develop and validate a new self-advocacy scale tailored to Chinese cancer patients. METHODS: In phase I, an item pool was formulated through a literature review, qualitative interviews with 14 cancer patients, and focus group discussions. In phase II, the scale's domains and items were revised based on feedback from two rounds of Delphi consultation involving 16 experts. In phase III, a cross-sectional survey was administered to a convenient sample of 257 cancer patients, and item analysis and exploratory factor analysis were used to explore the scale's structure. In Phase IV, the scale's validity and reliability were comprehensively evaluated using data from a convenience sample of 311 cancer patients. Finally, the Cancer Patient Self-Advocacy Scale (CPSAS) was developed. RESULTS: The newly developed scale comprised 21 items across four dimensions: information seeking, autonomous decision-making, active communication, and informational support. The scale demonstrated adequate convergent and discriminant validity supported by average variance extracted and composite reliability, good criterion validity through significant correlations with quality of life and treatment adherence, and excellent internal consistency and split-half reliability. CONCLUSIONS: The CPSAS is a valid, reliable, and efficient tool for assessing self-advocacy in Chinese cancer patients, suitable for both outpatient and inpatient settings. Additional research is necessary to evaluate the psychometric properties of the scale.",background selfadvocaci essenti cancer patient obtain highqual care howev exist selfadvocaci assess toolsdevelop western scholarsar poorli align cultur healthcar context china aim studi aim develop valid new selfadvocaci scale tailor chines cancer patient method phase item pool formul literatur review qualit interview 14 cancer patient focu group discuss phase ii scale domain item revis base feedback two round delphi consult involv 16 expert phase iii crosssect survey administ conveni sampl 257 cancer patient item analysi exploratori factor analysi use explor scale structur phase iv scale valid reliabl comprehens evalu use data conveni sampl 311 cancer patient final cancer patient selfadvocaci scale cpsa develop result newli develop scale compris 21 item across four dimens inform seek autonom decisionmak activ commun inform support scale demonstr adequ converg discrimin valid support averag varianc extract composit reliabl good criterion valid signific correl qualiti life treatment adher excel intern consist splithalf reliabl conclus cpsa valid reliabl effici tool assess selfadvocaci chines cancer patient suitabl outpati inpati set addit research necessari evalu psychometr properti scale
cancer,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), semiquantitatively expressed as the standardised uptake value (SUV(max)), is increasingly recognised as a prognostic factor and may predict metastatic progression after treatment. This study aims to evaluate the predictive value of SUV(max) on preoperative PSMA PET/CT for metastatic development after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). METHODS: This retrospective two-centre study included patients with nonmetastatic primary prostate cancer who underwent [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 or [(18)F]DCFPyL PSMA PET/CT prior to RARP. The minimum follow-up period was 1 yr. Metastases were assessed by restaging PSMA PET/CT at biochemical recurrence. SUV(max) was calculated for the dominant intraprostatic lesion on preoperative PSMA PET/CT. Multivariable Cox regression included SUV(max), clinical tumour stage (cT), initial prostate-specific antigen density, percentage positive biopsy cores, and biopsy International Society of Urological Pathology grade group. SUV(max) thresholds and model performance were investigated. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 293 patients underwent preoperative PSMA PET/CT, of whom 53 developed metastases after a median follow-up of 39 mo (interquartile range [IQR] 29-54). SUV(max) was higher in participants who developed metastases at 2-yr follow-up than in those without metastases (median 8.8; IQR 7.1-16 vs 7.8; IQR 5.7-13; p = 0.015). An SUV(max) of >10 was associated with an increased metastatic risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-3.13; p = 0.035) and log-SUV(max) independently predicted metastases (HR 2.80; 95% CI 1.02-7.70; p = 0.046).

cancer,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: It remains currently unknown whether the effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) before radical cystectomy (RC) for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is the same in patients with or without prior non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). This study aims to perform a real-world analysis of the predictive value of prior NMIBC for the effectiveness of NAC in patients undergoing RC for MIBC. METHODS: We included 2378 patients from the BLADRAC cohort who received RC with (n = 870; 37%) or without (n = 1508; 63%) NAC for primary (n = 1825; 77%) or secondary (n = 553; 23%) MIBC at 15 French centers from 2001 to 2023. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to identify the predictors of NAC delivery as well as those of pathological complete (pCR = [y]pT0N0) and pathological objective (pOR </=[y]pT1N0) responses, while we assessed the predictors of recurrence-free (RFS), cancer-specific (CSS), and overall (OS) survival using multivariable Cox regression models. The heterogeneity of treatment effect of NAC according to the occurrence of prior NMIBC was determined further by testing the interaction terms between the occurrence of prior NMIBC and the effect of NAC within the models evaluating pathological and survival outcomes. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Patients with secondary MIBC were significantly less likely to receive NAC (odds ratio [OR] = 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.5-0.79]; p < 0.001) than those with primary MIBC. The use of NAC was an independent predictor of better pCR (OR = 6.02; 95% CI = [4.63-7.83]; p < 0.001), pOR (OR = 5.08; 95% CI = [4.09-6.3]; p < 0.001), RFS (HR = 0.61; 95% CI = [0.53-0.71]; p < 0.001), CSS (HR = 0.57; 95% CI = [0.47-0.69]; p < 0.001), and OS (HR = 0.61; 95% CI = [0.51-0.72]; p < 0.001), while the occurrence of prior NMIBC was not significantly associated with any of these endpoints (all p > 0.05). There was no significant interaction between the occurrence of prior NMIBC and the impact of NAC on pCR, pOR, RFS, CSS, and OS (all p(interaction) > 0.05). The study is limited by its retrospective design. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our real-world data suggest that the occurrence of prior NMIBC could limit the access to NAC, while not predicting its effectiveness in patients treated with RC for localized MIBC.",background object remain current unknown whether effect neoadjuv chemotherapi nac radic cystectomi rc muscleinvas bladder cancer mibc patient without prior nonmuscl invas bladder cancer nmibc studi aim perform realworld analysi predict valu prior nmibc effect nac patient undergo rc mibc method includ 2378 patient bladrac cohort receiv rc n 870 37 without n 1508 63 nac primari n 1825 77 secondari n 553 23 mibc 15 french center 2001 2023 multivari logist regress model fit identifi predictor nac deliveri well patholog complet pcr ypt0n0 patholog object por ypt1n0 respons assess predictor recurrencefre rf cancerspecif css overal os surviv use multivari cox regress model heterogen treatment effect nac accord occurr prior nmibc determin test interact term occurr prior nmibc effect nac within model evalu patholog surviv outcom key find limit patient secondari mibc significantli less like receiv nac odd ratio 063 95 confid interv ci 05079 p 0001 primari mibc use nac independ predictor better pcr 602 95 ci 463783 p 0001 por 508 95 ci 40963 p 0001 rf hr 061 95 ci 053071 p 0001 css hr 057 95 ci 047069 p 0001 os hr 061 95 ci 051072 p 0001 occurr prior nmibc significantli associ endpoint p 005 signific interact occurr prior nmibc impact nac pcr por rf css os pinteract 005 studi limit retrospect design conclus clinic implic realworld data suggest occurr prior nmibc could limit access nac predict effect patient treat rc local mibc
cancer,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal malignancy characterized by late-stage diagnosis, resistance to conventional chemotherapy, and a dismal 5-year survival rate of approximately 12 %. These challenges underscore the urgent need for more effective therapeutic strategies. Recent advances in the understanding of PDAC pathophysiology, combined with the successful implementation of targeted therapies and immunotherapies in other cancer types, offer promising avenues for improving PDAC outcomes. This review summarized the latest developments in targeted and immune-based therapies for PDAC. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed (MEDLINE) and Web of Science, identifying 36 studies on targeted therapies and 24 studies on immunotherapies relevant to PDAC. Several investigational and approved agents, including KRAS inhibitors (MRTX1133, sotorasib), PARP inhibitors (olaparib), and immune checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab), have demonstrated encouraging results, particularly in combination regimens. These findings provide valuable insights into future research and clinical strategies aiming at improving the prognosis of PDAC.",pancreat ductal adenocarcinoma pdac highli lethal malign character latestag diagnosi resist convent chemotherapi dismal 5year surviv rate approxim 12 challeng underscor urgent need effect therapeut strategi recent advanc understand pdac pathophysiolog combin success implement target therapi immunotherapi cancer type offer promis avenu improv pdac outcom review summar latest develop target immunebas therapi pdac comprehens literatur search conduct use pubm medlin web scienc identifi 36 studi target therapi 24 studi immunotherapi relev pdac sever investig approv agent includ kra inhibitor mrtx1133 sotorasib parp inhibitor olaparib immun checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab demonstr encourag result particularli combin regimen find provid valuabl insight futur research clinic strategi aim improv prognosi pdac
cancer,"OBJECTIVES: About 75% of newly diagnosed bladder cancers are non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). NMIBC and its treatments affect patient functioning and quality of life. Exercise is feasible, safe, and beneficial for many cancer patient groups, however, no studies have examined exercise for NMIBC. We aimed to examine the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for patients with NMIBC during or after intravesical therapy. METHODS: The Bladder cancer and exeRcise trAining during or after intraVesical thErapy (BRAVE) trial randomized 25 NMIBC patients scheduled for or on surveillance after intravesical therapy to either usual care (n = 12) or HIIT (n = 13). The HIIT group performed thrice-weekly, supervised HIIT for 12 weeks. RESULTS: In 39 months, 293 patients were screened, 177 (60.4%) were eligible, and 25 (14.1%) were randomized. Median exercise attendance was 100%. From baseline to 12 weeks, VO(2peak) increased by 1.2 mL/kg/min in the HIIT group compared to a decrease of 0.7 mL/kg/min in the usual care group (adjusted between-group difference, 2.0 mL/kg/min; 95% CI: -0.4 to 4.4; P = .10; d = 0.37). Compared to the usual care group at 12 weeks, the HIIT group significantly improved 6-minute walk distance (adjusted between-group difference, 41 meters; 95% CI: 6-77; P = .025; d = 0.32) and the timed 8-foot up-and-go (adjusted between-group difference, -1.0 second; 95% CI: -1.9 to -0.2; P = .019; d = -0.44). CONCLUSIONS: Despite modest accrual, the BRAVE trial demonstrated that HIIT during or after intravesical therapy was safe and feasible for most NMIBC patients and resulted in meaningful improvements in several indicators of physical functioning. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Oncology nurses can inform NMIBC patients that high-intensity interval training may be safe, feasible, and potentially effective in improving physical functioning during or after intravesical therapy.",object 75 newli diagnos bladder cancer nonmuscl invas bladder cancer nmibc nmibc treatment affect patient function qualiti life exercis feasibl safe benefici mani cancer patient group howev studi examin exercis nmibc aim examin feasibl safeti preliminari efficaci highintens interv train hiit patient nmibc intraves therapi method bladder cancer exercis train intraves therapi brave trial random 25 nmibc patient schedul surveil intraves therapi either usual care n 12 hiit n 13 hiit group perform thriceweekli supervis hiit 12 week result 39 month 293 patient screen 177 604 elig 25 141 random median exercis attend 100 baselin 12 week vo2peak increas 12 mlkgmin hiit group compar decreas 07 mlkgmin usual care group adjust betweengroup differ 20 mlkgmin 95 ci 04 44 p 10 037 compar usual care group 12 week hiit group significantli improv 6minut walk distanc adjust betweengroup differ 41 meter 95 ci 677 p 025 032 time 8foot upandgo adjust betweengroup differ 10 second 95 ci 19 02 p 019 044 conclus despit modest accrual brave trial demonstr hiit intraves therapi safe feasibl nmibc patient result meaning improv sever indic physic function implic nurs practic oncolog nurs inform nmibc patient highintens interv train may safe feasibl potenti effect improv physic function intraves therapi

Understanding of the root causes of tumor heterogeneity is the key to develop strategies for more effective therapies. The intra-patient (inter-tumor), and inter-patient heterogeneity demands combinatorial treatment strategies anchored to patient-specific disease biology that can successfully tackle the complexity of the disease in the hopes of overcoming the biological barriers to cancer control.

Given the altered copper metabolism and metabolic dependencies of cancer cells, cuproptosis might represent a unique vulnerability with therapeutic potential. In this review we summarize current knowledge of copper homeostasis, the molecular mechanisms of cuproptosis and its roles in cancer biology. We highlight therapeutic strategies that harness cuproptosis, including copper ionophores, nanomedicine, and rational combination therapies, and discuss challenges such as systemic toxicity, resistance mechanisms, and biomarker development.

cancer,"Therapeutic drug monitoring of letrozole (LET) is very important for getting the best results in breast cancer treatment. Still, it is hindered by the lack of a rapid, highly sensitive point-of-care tool. This study presents the inaugural fully integrated molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP)-on-a-tip (MOT) electrochemical sensor for the highly sensitive quantification of LET in plasma. The miniature sensor combines a small pipette tip platform with a conductive matrix made from upcycled peanut shells and a selective MIP layer made through rapid electropolymerization of o-phenylenediamine. This design allows direct, in-tip measurement of LET in plasma without prior sample pretreatment. The MOT sensor showed a wide linear range (1.0-38.0 pM) for LET with outstanding sensitivity (LOD: 0.32 pM). When applied to human plasma, it achieved accurate results with an excellent recovery range (98.78-105.65 %), which shows that it could be a powerful tool for decentralized therapeutic drug monitoring and personalized medicine.",therapeut drug monitor letrozol let import get best result breast cancer treatment still hinder lack rapid highli sensit pointofcar tool studi present inaugur fulli integr molecularli imprint polym miponatip mot electrochem sensor highli sensit quantif let plasma miniatur sensor combin small pipett tip platform conduct matrix made upcycl peanut shell select mip layer made rapid electropolymer ophenylenediamin design allow direct intip measur let plasma without prior sampl pretreat mot sensor show wide linear rang 10380 pm let outstand sensit lod 032 pm appli human plasma achiev accur result excel recoveri rang 987810565 show could power tool decentr therapeut drug monitor person medicin
cancer,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Enzalutamide (Enza) is the only androgen receptor pathway inhibitor approved as monotherapy for high-risk biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. Breast-related adverse events (BRAEs) are common among patients treated with Enza monotherapy (Enza-Mono). We review relevant clinical trial data, including unpublished data, on measures to prevent BRAEs. Given the absence of data on mitigating strategies for Enza-associated BRAEs, we draw on pertinent prophylactic strategies used in studies of bicalutamide, a nonsteroidal antiandrogen with a similar mechanism of action. We critically discuss the clinical implications of such strategies to support decision-making in patients receiving Enza-Mono. METHODS: We searched PubMed for clinical trials on the safety of Enza-Mono, with a focus on BRAEs. We added relevant unpublished data from the EMBARK and ENACT trials. We also explored the literature and summarize prophylactic strategies for bicalutamide-induced BRAEs. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: In three trials involving 533 patients treated with Enza-Mono, Enza-Mono (160 mg/d) was commonly associated with gynecomastia (37-49%), breast pain or tenderness (14-26%), and/or nipple pain (15-30%). No prophylactic measures for BRAEs were protocol-specified in these studies. Previous studies with bicalutamide (150 mg/d) reported the benefits and relative tolerability of prophylactic radiation therapy and/or tamoxifen or prophylactic anastrozole to mitigate gynecomastia or breast pain. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Given the absence of data on prophylactic strategies for Enza-associated BRAEs, findings from bicalutamide studies could be extrapolated to Enza-Mono. Prospective trials are needed to optimize prophylactic strategies for BRAEs with Enza-Mono.",background object enzalutamid enza androgen receptor pathway inhibitor approv monotherapi highrisk biochem recurr prostat cancer breastrel advers event brae common among patient treat enza monotherapi enzamono review relev clinic trial data includ unpublish data measur prevent brae given absenc data mitig strategi enzaassoci brae draw pertin prophylact strategi use studi bicalutamid nonsteroid antiandrogen similar mechan action critic discuss clinic implic strategi support decisionmak patient receiv enzamono method search pubm clinic trial safeti enzamono focu brae ad relev unpublish data embark enact trial also explor literatur summar prophylact strategi bicalutamideinduc brae key find limit three trial involv 533 patient treat enzamono enzamono 160 mgd commonli associ gynecomastia 3749 breast pain tender 1426 andor nippl pain 1530 prophylact measur brae protocolspecifi studi previou studi bicalutamid 150 mgd report benefit rel toler prophylact radiat therapi andor tamoxifen prophylact anastrozol mitig gynecomastia breast pain conclus clinic implic given absenc data prophylact strategi enzaassoci brae find bicalutamid studi could extrapol enzamono prospect trial need optim prophylact strategi brae enzamono
cancer,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trimodal therapy (TMT)-comprising transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy-offers a bladder-preserving alternative to radical cystectomy for selected patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). However, the optimal criteria for patient selection and prognostication remain inadequately defined. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to optimize the selection of MIBC patients who are likely to have better survival outcomes from TMT. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science in February 2025. Eligible studies examined prognostic factors for overall or cancer-specific survival in patients with MIBC undergoing TMT. To reduce the impact of confounding, only multivariable-adjusted estimates were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a random-effect model. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool (CRD42025641514). KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 31 studies, including 9416 patients treated with TMT for MIBC, met the inclusion criteria. Older age (per year increase; HR: 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.05), poor performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group >/=2 vs 0-1; HR: 2.47, 95% CI: 1.78-3.43), impaired renal function (HR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.12-1.92), presence of hydronephrosis (HR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.17-2.34), advanced T stage (HR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.23-1.77), nodal involvement (HR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.10-3.30), and concomitant carcinoma in situ (HR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.02-3.20) were independently associated with worse overall survival. Limitations included heterogeneity in treatment protocols and potential residual confounding across studies. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Specific patient- and tumor-related factors are significantly associated with prognosis in patients undergoing TMT for MIBC.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Although minimally invasive surgery is widely accepted across surgical disciplines, its role in pancreatic cancer continues to be debated. The objective of the Sao Paulo Consensus on Minimally Invasive Pancreatic Surgery (MIPS) was to establish consensus statements on the use of MIPS for pancreatic cancer, integrating contemporary evidence and recent advances. METHODS: A scoping literature review informed statement development across five thematic groups: (1) Left Pancreatectomy for Pancreatic Cancer, (2) Pancreatoduodenectomy and Total Pancreatectomy for Pancreatic Cancer, (3) Neuroendocrine Pancreatic Tumors, (4) Patient Evaluation and Surgical Technique, and (5) Implementation, Training, and Innovation. A three-round modified Delphi process was conducted with an international panel of 52 expert pancreas surgeons. Consensus was defined as >/=90 % agreement. RESULTS: From 2590 publications, 185 studies were selected for inclusion. Fifty-two hepatopancreatobiliary surgeons, with a median of 22 years of experience, achieved consensus through a three-round Delphi process. Ultimately, 22 of the initial 28 statements met the >/=90 % agreement threshold. The resulting recommendations provide evidence-based guidance on minimally invasive pancreas resection for cancer, including neuroendocrine tumors, patient evaluation, program implementation, and innovation.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, with inherited cases conferring a markedly increased risk. The underlying mechanisms driving malignant transformation by CP remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: Combining a recently developed mouse model of CP carrying the human carboxypeptidase A1 (CPA1) p.N256K mutation with the established Kras(G12D) pancreatic cancer model, we characterised mechanisms linking chronic inflammation to early pancreatic carcinogenesis. DESIGN: We crossed Cpa1 (N256K) mice (Cpa1) with Ptf1a(Cre);Kras(LSL-G12D) (KC). In Cre, Cpa1, KC and KC-Cpa1 mice, we performed phenotypical characterisation at five early time points and in an ageing cohort. Assessment of histology combined with both RNA-sequencing and single-cell RNA-sequencing was performed to analyse metaplasia, preneoplastic lesions and cellular heterogeneity. RESULTS: KC-Cpa1 pancreata displayed a stark increase in remodelling, fibrosis and formation of metaplastic lesions as compared with KC. Cpa1(N256K) induced extensive plasticity in both the acinar and ductal compartment, including an early acinar-to-ductal metaplasia state in acinar cells characterised by an upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers and an inflammatory ductal phenotype (iDucts). We characterised the complex cell-cell communication networks underlying both pancreatic inflammation and early carcinogenesis, revealing disease-specific signalling between ductal cells, granulocytes and fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: The humanised KC-Cpa1 mouse model reveals the interplay of inflammation in hereditary CP and carcinogenesis. Cpa1(N256K) -induced plasticity in acinar and ductal cells, inflammation and cell-cell interaction networks cooperate with Kras(G12D) in early pancreatic carcinogenesis.",background chronic pancreat cp risk factor pancreat cancer inherit case confer markedli increas risk underli mechan drive malign transform cp remain poorli understood object combin recent develop mous model cp carri human carboxypeptidas a1 cpa1 pn256k mutat establish krasg12d pancreat cancer model characteris mechan link chronic inflamm earli pancreat carcinogenesi design cross cpa1 n256k mice cpa1 ptf1acrekraslslg12d kc cre cpa1 kc kccpa1 mice perform phenotyp characteris five earli time point age cohort assess histolog combin rnasequenc singlecel rnasequenc perform analys metaplasia preneoplast lesion cellular heterogen result kccpa1 pancreata display stark increas remodel fibrosi format metaplast lesion compar kc cpa1n256k induc extens plastic acinar ductal compart includ earli acinartoduct metaplasia state acinar cell characteris upregul endoplasm reticulum stress marker inflammatori ductal phenotyp iduct characteris complex cellcel commun network underli pancreat inflamm earli carcinogenesi reveal diseasespecif signal ductal cell granulocyt fibroblast conclus humanis kccpa1 mous model reveal interplay inflamm hereditari cp carcinogenesi cpa1n256k induc plastic acinar ductal cell inflamm cellcel interact network cooper krasg12d earli pancreat carcinogenesi
cancer,"PURPOSE: Despite several factors are associated with worse disease-free survival (DFS) and prognosis in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) patients, the effect of microscopic extrathyroidal extension (mETE) on the prognosis and DFS is not well understood. This study aims to evaluate the impact of mETE on DFS and prognosis in patients with MTC. METHODS: This multicenter study included 208 patients with MTC (17.8% with hereditary disease). Patients with mETE were compared to those without mETE in terms of clinical and histopathological variables. RESULTS: Among the 208 patients, 16.3% (n=34) had mETE on histopathological analysis. Patients with mETE were more likely to have larger tumors, higher serum calcitonin (CTN) levels before and after surgery, increased rates of neck lymph node (LN) and distant metastasis, multifocal disease, and advanced disease stage. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly lower DFS in patients with mETE than those without mETE (14.7% vs. 71.3%, log-rank p<0.001). However, mETE was not an independent contributing factor for persistent/recurrent disease, whereas neck LN involvement was the strongest independent contributing factor for persistent/recurrent disease (HR: 1.1; 95% CI 0.4-1.8, p=0.76 and HR: 9.6; 95% CI 1.21-76.9, p=0.03, respectively). CONCLUSION: mETE in patients with MTC is associated with a lower DFS, larger tumor sizes, a higher likelihood of neck LN and distant metastasis, advanced stage, higher serum CTN levels, multifocality, and persistent/recurrent disease. However, mETE was not an independent predictor of persistent/recurrent disease. Further studies with a larger number of patients with mETE could further clarify the impact of mETE on the prognosis of MTC.",purpos despit sever factor associ wors diseasefre surviv df prognosi medullari thyroid carcinoma mtc patient effect microscop extrathyroid extens mete prognosi df well understood studi aim evalu impact mete df prognosi patient mtc method multicent studi includ 208 patient mtc 178 hereditari diseas patient mete compar without mete term clinic histopatholog variabl result among 208 patient 163 n34 mete histopatholog analysi patient mete like larger tumor higher serum calcitonin ctn level surgeri increas rate neck lymph node ln distant metastasi multifoc diseas advanc diseas stage kaplanmei analysi show significantli lower df patient mete without mete 147 vs 713 logrank p0001 howev mete independ contribut factor persistentrecurr diseas wherea neck ln involv strongest independ contribut factor persistentrecurr diseas hr 11 95 ci 0418 p076 hr 96 95 ci 121769 p003 respect conclus mete patient mtc associ lower df larger tumor size higher likelihood neck ln distant metastasi advanc stage higher serum ctn level multifoc persistentrecurr diseas howev mete independ predictor persistentrecurr diseas studi larger number patient mete could clarifi impact mete prognosi mtc
cancer,"Immunotherapy is an increasingly used treatment for different types of cancer. The most widely used are cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors, PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) inhibitors and PD-1 receptor inhibitors. All of them can produce endocrine autoimmune side effects in multiple organs. The most frequent are thyroid disorders and hypophysitis although, less frequently, they can also cause autoimmune adrenalitis and autoimmune diabetes. Thyroid involvement is usually transient but can become chronic in the form of hypothyroidism in more than 50% of cases.

cancer,"A woman in her early 60s with a remote history of lung cancer presented with severe hypercortisolism, bilateral pulmonary consolidations and progressive cognitive decline. Extensive imaging and biopsies failed to identify a definitive adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting tumour, but pulmonary nocardiosis was diagnosed, reflecting profound cortisol-induced immunosuppression. Management was further complicated by limited social supports and a history of unstable housing, raising concerns about access to advanced imaging and reliable follow-up. Despite medical therapy, hypercortisolism persisted, and she ultimately underwent bilateral adrenalectomy with marked improvement. This case illustrates the challenges of occult ectopic ACTH syndrome and underscores the importance of multidisciplinary management.",woman earli 60 remot histori lung cancer present sever hypercortisol bilater pulmonari consolid progress cognit declin extens imag biopsi fail identifi definit adrenocorticotrop hormon acthsecret tumour pulmonari nocardiosi diagnos reflect profound cortisolinduc immunosuppress manag complic limit social support histori unstabl hous rais concern access advanc imag reliabl followup despit medic therapi hypercortisol persist ultim underw bilater adrenalectomi mark improv case illustr challeng occult ectop acth syndrom underscor import multidisciplinari manag
cancer,"Paraneoplastic microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA) is a rare condition characterised by tumour-driven erythrocyte destruction and platelet consumption. It is uncommon in colorectal cancer (CRC) and, without treatment, is often fatal within days. We describe a woman in her 50s who developed transfusion-refractory anaemia and thrombocytopaenia during workup for suspected metastatic CRC. Haemolysis screen was positive, and blood film showed fragmentation and leukoerythroblastosis, suggesting paraneoplastic MAHA. Following multidisciplinary discussion, she underwent D3 right hemicolectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies. Despite brief postoperative improvement, her MAHA progressed, and she passed away on day 2. Pathology revealed ileocaecal signet ring cell adenocarcinoma with bilateral Krukenberg tumours, peritoneal metastases and 31/31 positive nodes (stage IVc). This case highlights the life-threatening nature of CRC-MAHA and challenges in diagnosis and management. Prompt anticancer therapy offers the only hope at remission; however, salvage is difficult.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Despite breakthroughs in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), tumor immune evasion remains a major limitation to immunotherapy efficacy. PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) has highlighted roles in immune system regulation and tumor progression, but its specific role in HCC and impact on ICB response remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate how PINK1 dysfunction enables HCC adaptation to ICB-induced immune attacks and identify potential therapeutic targets. METHODS: Online patient dataset analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of reduced PINK1 expression on clinical prognosis in HCC. An orthotopic HCC tumor cell mouse model was established. Single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry were employed to explore the immune characteristics and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment in PINK1-deficient HCC. Neutrophils and T cells were isolated, stimulated, and/or cultured for ex vivo functional assays. Gene Expression Omnibus database analyses were performed to identify key genes involved in HCC resistance to ICB. RESULTS: We identified PINK1 as a key mediator of ICB resistance in HCC. We found that PINK1 expression was significantly reduced in ICB-resistant HCC and a reduced PINK1 signature was associated with poorer clinical outcomes in patients with HCC. Importantly, PINK1 deficiency serves as a predictive biomarker for diminished responsiveness to immunotherapy. Function experiments have revealed that PINK1 regulates HCC progression and infiltration and activation of neutrophils and T cells. Mechanistically, the tumor cell-intrinsic downregulation of PINK1 activated the production of chemokines involved in neutrophil recruitment, and tumor-infiltrating neutrophils inhibited T cell activity. Additionally, a neutrophil-depleting antibody resensitized tumors to antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 therapy in orthotopic HCC models, further demonstrating that neutrophils are the primary population responsible for the adaptation of cancer cells with reduced PINK1 to ICB-induced immune attacks. CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered PINK1 as both a predictor of the ICB response and a key mediator of immune evasion by promoting neutrophil infiltration. These results highlight that the therapeutic targeting of neutrophils may represent a viable strategy to overcome ICB resistance in HCC.",background despit breakthrough immun checkpoint blockad icb advanc hepatocellular carcinoma hcc tumor immun evas remain major limit immunotherapi efficaci pteninduc put kinas 1 pink1 highlight role immun system regul tumor progress specif role hcc impact icb respons remain unclear studi aim elucid pink1 dysfunct enabl hcc adapt icbinduc immun attack identifi potenti therapeut target method onlin patient dataset analys perform evalu impact reduc pink1 express clinic prognosi hcc orthotop hcc tumor cell mous model establish singlecel rna sequenc flow cytometri employ explor immun characterist remodel tumor microenviron pink1defici hcc neutrophil cell isol stimul andor cultur ex vivo function assay gene express omnibu databas analys perform identifi key gene involv hcc resist icb result identifi pink1 key mediat icb resist hcc found pink1 express significantli reduc icbresist hcc reduc pink1 signatur associ poorer clinic outcom patient hcc importantli pink1 defici serv predict biomark diminish respons immunotherapi function experi reveal pink1 regul hcc progress infiltr activ neutrophil cell mechanist tumor cellintrins downregul pink1 activ product chemokin involv neutrophil recruit tumorinfiltr neutrophil inhibit cell activ addit neutrophildeplet antibodi resensit tumor antiprogram deathligand 1 therapi orthotop hcc model demonstr neutrophil primari popul respons adapt cancer cell reduc pink1 icbinduc immun attack conclus studi uncov pink1 predictor icb respons key mediat immun evas promot neutrophil infiltr result highlight therapeut target neutrophil may repres viabl strategi overcom icb resist hcc
cancer,"Colibactin is a pseudo-C(2)-symmetric gut microbiome metabolite that induces DNA interstrand cross-links and plays a causal role in colorectal cancer. Since efforts to isolate colibactin have not been successful, we developed colibactin 742 (3a/b) as a stable colibactin mimetic. However, colibactin 742 (3a/b) exists as a mixture of ring and chain isomers, which complicates analysis of its activity. We report here the discovery of colibactin 686 (9) as a superior colibactin mimetic. Colibactin 686 (9) is more potent than colibactin 742 (3a/b) and recapitulates the bacterial genotoxic phenotype. Colibactin 686 (9) possesses a C(2)-symmetric structure, which will expedite its synthesis, and is incapable of ring-chain isomerization, which will simplify analysis of its biological activity. We additionally establish that colibactins do not passively diffuse into cells, and are substrates for monocarboxylate transporter pumps.

cancer,"While the contribution of the IGF-signaling axis in breast cancer is well documented, the role of IGFBP-6 in breast carcinogenesis has not been extensively studied. In general, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-6 (IGFBP-6) sequesters Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) to attenuate activation of its cognate receptor IGF-1R. To reveal previously unknown mechanisms of breast cancer modulation by IGFBP-6 in breast cancer, proteomic analysis was performed in T47D cells after IGFBP-6 knockdown. Comparing protein expression and phosphosites after knockdown by unique siRNA sequences with a negative control and subsequent pathway analysis, a decrease in IGFBP-6 expression resulted in activation of interferon signaling pathways and a decrease in pathways involved in the G2/M cell cycle transition. A subset of the proteins identified in each cell regulatory pathway were validated by immunoblotting for specific proteins after IGFBP-6 knockdown. Cell cycle analysis showed that IGFBP-6 knockdown in Hormone Receptor Positive T47D breast cancer cells resulted in an increased number of cells in the G1 phase and a decrease in cells in G2 indicating a role for IGFBP-6 in cell cycle regulation. Knockdown of IGFBP-6 in a Triple Negative breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, also resulted in a decrease in Cyclin B1 accumulation demonstrating that our observations are not cell line specific. Taken together, our results demonstrate that IGFBP-6 regulates cell cycle progression in breast cancer cells and interferon signaling in hormone positive cells.",contribut igfsign axi breast cancer well document role igfbp6 breast carcinogenesi extens studi gener insulinlik growth factor bind protein6 igfbp6 sequest insulinlik growth factor 2 igf2 attenu activ cognat receptor igf1r reveal previous unknown mechan breast cancer modul igfbp6 breast cancer proteom analysi perform t47d cell igfbp6 knockdown compar protein express phosphosit knockdown uniqu sirna sequenc neg control subsequ pathway analysi decreas igfbp6 express result activ interferon signal pathway decreas pathway involv g2m cell cycl transit subset protein identifi cell regulatori pathway valid immunoblot specif protein igfbp6 knockdown cell cycl analysi show igfbp6 knockdown hormon receptor posit t47d breast cancer cell result increas number cell g1 phase decreas cell g2 indic role igfbp6 cell cycl regul knockdown igfbp6 tripl neg breast cancer cell line mdamb231 also result decreas cyclin b1 accumul demonstr observ cell line specif taken togeth result demonstr igfbp6 regul cell cycl progress breast cancer cell interferon signal hormon posit cell
cancer,"Corepressors CtBP1 and CtBP2 (CtBP1/2) are evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulators that repress gene expression by recruiting chromatin modifiers, yet the structural basis of this process remains elusive. Here, we identify a direct interaction between CtBP1/2 and the histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase G9a. Crystallographic and biochemical analyses reveal that a CtBP1/2 tetramer simultaneously engages two G9a molecules through a motif within the pre-SET domain of G9a, which is absent in its paralog GLP. This interaction enhances G9a catalytic activity in a manner strictly dependent on the oligomeric state of CtBP1/2. Disruption of CtBP2 tetramerization diminishes its association with G9a and abolishes enzymatic activation, underscoring the functional importance of CtBP1/2 oligomerization. In colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells, CtBP2 and G9a co-occupy the PTEN promoter, where disruption of their interface reduces H3K9me2 deposition, derepresses PTEN expression, attenuates PI3K-AKT signaling, and impairs CRC cell proliferation. Together, these findings establish a structural framework for CtBP-mediated regulation of G9a activity and highlight the CtBP1/2-G9a complex as a potential therapeutic target in colorectal cancer.",corepressor ctbp1 ctbp2 ctbp12 evolutionarili conserv transcript regul repress gene express recruit chromatin modifi yet structur basi process remain elus identifi direct interact ctbp12 histon h3 lysin 9 h3k9 methyltransferas g9a crystallograph biochem analys reveal ctbp12 tetram simultan engag two g9a molecul motif within preset domain g9a absent paralog glp interact enhanc g9a catalyt activ manner strictli depend oligomer state ctbp12 disrupt ctbp2 tetramer diminish associ g9a abolish enzymat activ underscor function import ctbp12 oligomer colorect carcinoma crc cell ctbp2 g9a cooccupi pten promot disrupt interfac reduc h3k9me2 deposit derepress pten express attenu pi3kakt signal impair crc cell prolifer togeth find establish structur framework ctbpmediat regul g9a activ highlight ctbp12g9a complex potenti therapeut target colorect cancer
cancer,"The volume-regulated anion channel VRAC is a hetero-hexamer composed of LRRC8A and any of the four other LRRC8 paralogs (LRRC8B-E). Depending on their subunit composition, VRACs not only transport chloride, but also a range of organic substrates including 2'3'-cGAMP (cGAMP). Transfer of this immunomodulator from tumor to host cells is critical for anti-tumor immunity. Whether this process depends on VRAC in vivo remains incompletely understood. To address this issue, we studied subcutaneous MC38 and B16-F10 tumors in syngeneic mice. Enhanced growth of MC38 tumors lacking cGAMP production confirmed the importance of tumor-produced cGAMP. The impact of VRAC-mediated cGAMP-efflux from tumor cells and its uptake into cells of the tumor microenvironment was investigated using LRRC8A-deficient tumor cells and recipient mice with selective LRRC8 subunit disruptions, respectively. Changed serum cytokines indicated moderate immunomodulatory effects of VRAC-mediated cGAMP export from MC38 tumors. However, tumor growth and the cGAMP-mediated anti-tumor immune response were independent of both, tumor- and host-expressed VRAC. Disruption of any of the non-essential subunits, LRRC8B-LRRC8E, had no discernible effect on T or B cell development in mice. Whereas tumor-produced cGAMP markedly suppresses tumor growth, transport of this immunomodulator to the tumor environment primarily involves transporters distinct from VRAC.",volumeregul anion channel vrac heterohexam compos lrrc8a four lrrc8 paralog lrrc8be depend subunit composit vrac transport chlorid also rang organ substrat includ 23cgamp cgamp transfer immunomodul tumor host cell critic antitumor immun whether process depend vrac vivo remain incomplet understood address issu studi subcutan mc38 b16f10 tumor syngen mice enhanc growth mc38 tumor lack cgamp product confirm import tumorproduc cgamp impact vracmedi cgampefflux tumor cell uptak cell tumor microenviron investig use lrrc8adefici tumor cell recipi mice select lrrc8 subunit disrupt respect chang serum cytokin indic moder immunomodulatori effect vracmedi cgamp export mc38 tumor howev tumor growth cgampmedi antitumor immun respons independ tumor hostexpress vrac disrupt nonessenti subunit lrrc8blrrc8e discern effect b cell develop mice wherea tumorproduc cgamp markedli suppress tumor growth transport immunomodul tumor environ primarili involv transport distinct vrac
cancer,"Hypoxia forms an immunosuppression environment and is involved in tumor immune escape, which may be the potential culprit of resistance to anticancer therapies. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of research that explores the characteristics of hypoxia in pan-cancer at the single-cell level and assesses the application of hypoxia in ICI efficacy and clinical outcomes. We delineated cell-specific hypoxia levels and developed a computational framework to generate a pan-cancer tumor hypoxia-related transcriptomic signature (HYP.SIG) using 38 scRNA-seq datasets encompassing 362 patients and 893464 cells across 19 cancer types. We defined computational indicators of hypoxia levels as HYP.SIG scores to characterize the hypoxia status across 33 cancer types and 29 normal tissues within 18901 samples. HYP.SIG scores exhibited cancer type-specific associations with genetic instability, and were linked to oncogenic signaling, poor response to ICI therapy, and impaired survival in multiple cancer types. Moreover, we established a predictive model for immunotherapy response utilizing 6 machine learning algorithms and 9 ICI cohorts (904 patients, 4 cancer types). HYP.SIG achieved better predictive performances in comparison to other previously established signatures. Subsequently, we applied three machine learning-based feature selection algorithms to filter HYP.SIG survival-related signatures and developed a prognostic model for predicting overall survival, incorporating clinical disease stages. Eventually, we screened four candidate therapeutic targets (LDHA, SERF2, SLC2A1, NOP53) for patients with tumors using 17 CRISPR cohorts and 1078 CRISPR cell lines. Overall, our study provides new ideas for survival prognostication, prediction of ICI response, and clinical therapeutic target development from the perspective of hypoxia.",hypoxia form immunosuppress environ involv tumor immun escap may potenti culprit resist anticanc therapi nevertheless still lack research explor characterist hypoxia pancanc singlecel level assess applic hypoxia ici efficaci clinic outcom delin cellspecif hypoxia level develop comput framework gener pancanc tumor hypoxiarel transcriptom signatur hypsig use 38 scrnaseq dataset encompass 362 patient 893464 cell across 19 cancer type defin comput indic hypoxia level hypsig score character hypoxia statu across 33 cancer type 29 normal tissu within 18901 sampl hypsig score exhibit cancer typespecif associ genet instabl link oncogen signal poor respons ici therapi impair surviv multipl cancer type moreov establish predict model immunotherapi respons util 6 machin learn algorithm 9 ici cohort 904 patient 4 cancer type hypsig achiev better predict perform comparison previous establish signatur subsequ appli three machin learningbas featur select algorithm filter hypsig survivalrel signatur develop prognost model predict overal surviv incorpor clinic diseas stage eventu screen four candid therapeut target ldha serf2 slc2a1 nop53 patient tumor use 17 crispr cohort 1078 crispr cell line overal studi provid new idea surviv prognost predict ici respons clinic therapeut target develop perspect hypoxia
cancer,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate semaglutide's multisystem therapeutic benefits across 12 health domains. Primary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), resolution of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), and composite renal endpoints. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central were searched through June 30, 2025, following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials in adults (>/=18 years) with >/=24-week follow-up comparing semaglutide (>/=0.5 mg weekly subcutaneous or >/=7 mg daily oral) versus placebo or active comparators. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed bias (RoB 2) and certainty (GRADE). RESULTS: Thirty-five trials (n = 36,847; mean age 54.2 years; BMI 34.8 kg/m(2)) were included. Semaglutide reduced HbA1c (-1.52%, 95% CI -1.60 to -1.44) and weight (-12.4 kg, 95% CI -13.0 to -11.8). Non-glycemic benefits included MACE reduction (16%, RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.77-0.92), MASH resolution (62.9%, RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.49-2.27), renal protection (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.68-0.85), improved vascular function (+87 m walking distance), favorable body composition (87:13 fat-to-lean ratio), and better quality of life (+3.8 SF-36 points).

cancer,"This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the prognostic value of the BRAF V600E mutation in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). A comprehensive search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science up to August 31, 2025 identified 46 eligible studies including 20,570 patients, following PRISMA guidelines and QUADAS-2 quality assessment. Random-effects models were applied to evaluate associations between BRAF status and major oncological outcomes. BRAF V600E mutation was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (OR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.17-1.61) and showed a borderline association with recurrence risk (OR = 1.56; 95% CI, 1.00-2.41). In contrast, no significant associations were observed for distant metastases (OR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.48-1.17) or cancer-related mortality (OR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.64-1.49). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of all pooled estimates. Meta-regressions revealed an inverse relationship between BRAF mutation prevalence and its prognostic impact, suggesting that the higher the mutation prevalence in a population, the lower its discriminative prognostic power. Funnel plot inspection and Egger's tests indicated no major publication bias. Overall, these findings confirm that BRAF V600E mutation is associated with an increased risk of nodal metastasis and recurrence in papillary thyroid carcinoma. However, its lack of impact on distant metastases and disease-specific mortality limits its role as an independent prognostic marker in clinical decision-making.",systemat review metaanalysi investig prognost valu braf v600e mutat papillari thyroid carcinoma ptc comprehens search pubmedmedlin scopu web scienc august 31 2025 identifi 46 elig studi includ 20570 patient follow prisma guidelin quadas2 qualiti assess randomeffect model appli evalu associ braf statu major oncolog outcom braf v600e mutat significantli associ lymph node metastasi 138 95 ci 117161 show borderlin associ recurr risk 156 95 ci 100241 contrast signific associ observ distant metastas 075 95 ci 048117 cancerrel mortal 097 95 ci 064149 sensit analys confirm robust pool estim metaregress reveal invers relationship braf mutat preval prognost impact suggest higher mutat preval popul lower discrimin prognost power funnel plot inspect egger test indic major public bia overal find confirm braf v600e mutat associ increas risk nodal metastasi recurr papillari thyroid carcinoma howev lack impact distant metastas diseasespecif mortal limit role independ prognost marker clinic decisionmak
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Most patients with differentiated thyroid cancer have low-risk disease and excellent prognosis. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression therapy after initial treatment may be unnecessary and potentially harmful for survivors with recurrence-free, low-risk or intermediate-risk thyroid cancer. Little is known about clinician-reported barriers and facilitators to reducing thyroid cancer survivors' thyroid hormone dose with the goal of aiming for TSH in the normal reference range. METHODS: Clinicians from the fields of endocrinology (n=8) and primary care [PCPs] (n=7) were recruited through convenience/snowball sampling to participate in semi-structured focus groups. Data collection and analyses were informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework for behavior change, a valuable integrative framework which can facilitate comprehensive assessment of behavioral determinants in qualitative studies. Deductive coding and inductive thematic analysis were conducted. RESULTS: Participants were majority female (73%) and averaged 14 years in clinical practice (range, 1-22). Barriers and facilitators emerged at the patient-level, clinician-level, and system-level. Key clinician-reported barriers included patient distress/anxiety and misinformation, unclear shared patient survivorship goals and plans between specialties, and clinic visit time constraints. Clinician-reported facilitators included building a trusting relationship, delivery of patient-centered education, and communication and collaboration between specialties to establish shared long-term survivorship plans. CONCLUSIONS: We identified barriers and facilitators to de-escalating TSH suppression therapy in thyroid cancer survivors at multiple levels. Understanding these factors will enable clinicians to provide high-value, patient-centered care in order to reduce overtreatment, patient harm and improve quality of life in thyroid cancer survivors.",object patient differenti thyroid cancer lowrisk diseas excel prognosi thyroid stimul hormon tsh suppress therapi initi treatment may unnecessari potenti harm survivor recurrencefre lowrisk intermediaterisk thyroid cancer littl known clinicianreport barrier facilit reduc thyroid cancer survivor thyroid hormon dose goal aim tsh normal refer rang method clinician field endocrinolog n8 primari care pcp n7 recruit conveniencesnowbal sampl particip semistructur focu group data collect analys inform theoret domain framework behavior chang valuabl integr framework facilit comprehens assess behavior determin qualit studi deduct code induct themat analysi conduct result particip major femal 73 averag 14 year clinic practic rang 122 barrier facilit emerg patientlevel clinicianlevel systemlevel key clinicianreport barrier includ patient distressanxieti misinform unclear share patient survivorship goal plan specialti clinic visit time constraint clinicianreport facilit includ build trust relationship deliveri patientcent educ commun collabor specialti establish share longterm survivorship plan conclus identifi barrier facilit deescal tsh suppress therapi thyroid cancer survivor multipl level understand factor enabl clinician provid highvalu patientcent care order reduc overtreat patient harm improv qualiti life thyroid cancer survivor
cancer,"OBJECTIVES: The long-term safety of antidiabetic medications, particularly their potential association with bladder cancer (BC), remains a concern in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antidiabetic medications to placebo in T2DM patients, focusing on BC outcomes. Database searched included PubMed, Embase (via OVID), Web of Science (Core Collection), Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 20 June 2025. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistic. Subgroup analyses were conducted by drug class ((dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1Ras), sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i), thiazolidinedione (TZD)). Publication bias was assessed via funnel plot. RESULTS: Overall, antidiabetic medications were not significantly associated with an increased or decreased risk of BC (pooled OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.67-1.20; I(2) = 0.0%). Subgroup analyses by drug class also showed no statistically significant associations: DPP-4i (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.67-1.85; I(2) = 0.0%), GLP-1Ras (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.42-1.22; I(2) = 0.0%), and SGLT-2i (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.50-1.24; I(2) = 0.0%). For thiazolidinediones, only one study (pioglitazone) reported an OR of 2.37 (95% CI: 0.91-6.17), which was not statistically significant. Funnel plots suggested no obvious publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that antidiabetic medications, including DPP-4i, GLP-1Ras, and SGLT-2i, are not significantly associated with BC risk in T2DM patients.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: The infection by Human Papillomaviruses (HPV) has long been established as one of the main causes of cervical cancer, with HPV16/HPV18 high-risk types expressing E6/E7 oncoproteins that inhibit p53/pRB tumor suppressor proteins. Therefore, this work focuses on gene therapy, using the innovative minicircle DNA (mcDNA) vector to protect and express the pri-miR-375 in the cancer cell nucleus, ultimately originating the microRNA-375 (miR-375) in the cytoplasm. This miR-375, initially downregulated in cervical cancer cells, can silence HPV E6/E7 transcripts, thereby negatively regulating the expression of these oncoproteins. METHODS: The mcDNA-pri-miR-375 vector was successfully constructed, biosynthesized in the host cell, extracted, and purified, followed by several in vitro transfection studies in CaSKi cells (HPV16-infected cervical cancer model) to evaluate the mcDNA-pri-miR-375 effect. RESULTS: FITC-stained-mcDNA-pri-miR-375 was present in cancer cell nucleus, confirmed by confocal microscopy. RT-PCR analysis showed a more intense band of miR-375 transcripts, and RT-PCR/ RT-qPCR confirmed that E6/ E7 transcript levels were nearly 80 % diminished 24 h after CaSki cells transfection. Also, western-blot showed a decreased band intensity for E6/ E7 proteins on transfected cells. Proliferation and cell invasion studies demonstrated growth and migration arrest for CaSki cells throughout 72 h. Cell viability study of these cells also revealed a gradual decrease for the same period, while the NHDF cell viability was not affected, indicating specificity towards CaSki. The consequent effect of silencing the E6/ E7 transcripts was also observed through an increase in p53 protein levels (determined by western blot and ELISA) and caspase-3 activity, after 48 h of CaSki cell transfection. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that mcDNA-pri-miR-375 vector has the potential to be further explored in gene therapy for the treatment of HPV-caused cervical cancer.",background infect human papillomavirus hpv long establish one main caus cervic cancer hpv16hpv18 highrisk type express e6e7 oncoprotein inhibit p53prb tumor suppressor protein therefor work focus gene therapi use innov minicircl dna mcdna vector protect express primir375 cancer cell nucleu ultim origin microrna375 mir375 cytoplasm mir375 initi downregul cervic cancer cell silenc hpv e6e7 transcript therebi neg regul express oncoprotein method mcdnaprimir375 vector success construct biosynthes host cell extract purifi follow sever vitro transfect studi caski cell hpv16infect cervic cancer model evalu mcdnaprimir375 effect result fitcstainedmcdnaprimir375 present cancer cell nucleu confirm confoc microscopi rtpcr analysi show intens band mir375 transcript rtpcr rtqpcr confirm e6 e7 transcript level nearli 80 diminish 24 h caski cell transfect also westernblot show decreas band intens e6 e7 protein transfect cell prolifer cell invas studi demonstr growth migrat arrest caski cell throughout 72 h cell viabil studi cell also reveal gradual decreas period nhdf cell viabil affect indic specif toward caski consequ effect silenc e6 e7 transcript also observ increas p53 protein level determin western blot elisa caspase3 activ 48 h caski cell transfect conclus result suggest mcdnaprimir375 vector potenti explor gene therapi treatment hpvcaus cervic cancer
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Laryngeal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors of the head and neck, with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) being the most significant pathological type. Transfer RNA-derived fragments (tRFs) fragments have been implicated in tumor progression through diverse regulatory mechanisms. This study examined the diagnostic value and role of tRF-Val-CAC-008 in LSCC. METHODS: Levels of tRF-Val-CAC-008 were quantified in LSCC tissues, plasma, saliva, and cells using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The diagnostic value of tRF-Val-CAC-008 was then assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. LSCC cells were transfected with mimics or inhibitors of tRF-Val-CAC-008, which increased or decreased its level accordingly. Cell proliferation was evaluated using EdU and the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assays. The level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in LSCC cells was measured using an LDH release assay. Pyroptosis-associated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting (WB). RESULTS: tRF-Val-CAC-008 exhibited significantly higher expression levels in LSCC tissues, plasma and saliva. This higher expression correlated with its pro-proliferative effects and suppression of pyroptosis observed in vitro. In LSCC cells, tRF-Val-CAC-008 mimics promoted cell proliferation and reduced LDH secretion. The expression of gasdermin E (GSDME) and caspase-3 proteins was also decreased by tRF-Val-CAC-008 mimics, which in turn regulated pyroptosis. The ROC curves suggest that combined plasma and saliva tRF-Val-CAC-008 can serve as a diagnostic marker to distinguish LSCC patients from healthy participants. CONCLUSIONS: The study concluded that tRF-Val-CAC-008 could act as a diagnostic marker for LSCC; it promotes tumor growth by suppressing pyroptosis and promoting cell proliferation.",object laryng cancer one common malign tumor head neck laryng squamou cell carcinoma lscc signific patholog type transfer rnaderiv fragment trf fragment implic tumor progress divers regulatori mechan studi examin diagnost valu role trfvalcac008 lscc method level trfvalcac008 quantifi lscc tissu plasma saliva cell use realtim quantit revers transcript polymeras chain reaction qrtpcr diagnost valu trfvalcac008 assess use receiv oper characterist roc curv lscc cell transfect mimic inhibitor trfvalcac008 increas decreas level accordingli cell prolifer evalu use edu cell count kit8 cck8 assay level lactat dehydrogenas ldh lscc cell measur use ldh releas assay pyroptosisassoci protein analyz western blot wb result trfvalcac008 exhibit significantli higher express level lscc tissu plasma saliva higher express correl proprolif effect suppress pyroptosi observ vitro lscc cell trfvalcac008 mimic promot cell prolifer reduc ldh secret express gasdermin e gsdme caspase3 protein also decreas trfvalcac008 mimic turn regul pyroptosi roc curv suggest combin plasma saliva trfvalcac008 serv diagnost marker distinguish lscc patient healthi particip conclus studi conclud trfvalcac008 could act diagnost marker lscc promot tumor growth suppress pyroptosi promot cell prolifer
cancer,"The clinical translation of bacteria-mediated immunotherapy has been hindered by severe systemic toxicity due to off-target bacterial colonization. To address these limitations, we developed a glutathione (GSH)-responsive self-assembling peptide that forms a nanofibrous coating on Salmonella typhimurium, enabling spatiotemporal control over bacterial activity. The peptide binds lipopolysaccharides on the bacterial surface via electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions, forming a stable protective layer that shields immunogenic epitopes. In the reductive tumor microenvironment, elevated GSH levels trigger disulfide bond cleavage, resulting in disassembly of the peptide shell and controlled bacterial release at tumor sites. In vivo, 10 muM and 20 muM peptide coatings enhanced tumor accumulation by ~2.5- and ~ 1.5-fold, respectively, primarily by enhancing tumor retention and reducing pre-targeting immune clearance. This was accompanied by an increase in tumor-infiltrating neutrophils, key effectors in tumor regression. Importantly, this occurred with markedly reduced systemic inflammation and organ toxicity compared with unmodified bacteria. This strategy offers a promising platform for improving the precision and safety of bacterial immunotherapy, advancing its potential for clinical application in cancer treatment.",clinic translat bacteriamedi immunotherapi hinder sever system toxic due offtarget bacteri colon address limit develop glutathion gshrespons selfassembl peptid form nanofibr coat salmonella typhimurium enabl spatiotempor control bacteri activ peptid bind lipopolysaccharid bacteri surfac via electrostat hydrogen bond interact form stabl protect layer shield immunogen epitop reduct tumor microenviron elev gsh level trigger disulfid bond cleavag result disassembl peptid shell control bacteri releas tumor site vivo 10 mum 20 mum peptid coat enhanc tumor accumul 25 15fold respect primarili enhanc tumor retent reduc pretarget immun clearanc accompani increas tumorinfiltr neutrophil key effector tumor regress importantli occur markedli reduc system inflamm organ toxic compar unmodifi bacteria strategi offer promis platform improv precis safeti bacteri immunotherapi advanc potenti clinic applic cancer treatment
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) frequently develops resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), particularly in malignant pleural effusion (MPE), where a highly acidic tumor microenvironment promotes the emergence of drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells. Building upon previous evidence that MPE acidity drives metabolic plasticity, this study investigates how acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) coordinates PLCG1-dependent macropinocytosis to maintain osimertinib tolerance. METHODS: Primary MPE-derived NSCLC cultures underwent next-generation sequencing to define mutational heterogeneity. Acidic (pH 6.5-6.8) conditions were used to generate osimertinib-induced DTP (Osi-DTP) models. Functional assays assessed viability, invasion, colony formation, autophagy, and macropinocytosis. ASIC3 was silenced using shRNA, followed by Seahorse metabolic analysis. Transcriptomic profiling identified differentially expressed genes. ASIC3-targeted therapeutic interventions were evaluated in vitro and in xenograft models. RESULTS: MPE-derived NSCLC cultures showed substantial genomic diversity, including EGFR exon 19 deletion and T790M mutations. Acid-adapted Osi-DTP cells exhibited EMT-like phenotypes, reduced proliferation, elevated stemness markers, and strong activation of stress-response pathways. ASIC3 was consistently upregulated under acidic conditions and drove PLCG1-mediated macropinocytosis to support nutrient scavenging and survival. ASIC3 knockdown markedly reduced DTP cell viability, invasiveness, colony formation, autophagy, and glycolysis, while inducing a metabolic shift toward oxidative phosphorylation. In vivo, combining an ASIC3 inhibitor with osimertinib significantly delayed tumor progression and improved survival without added toxicity. Clinically, high ASIC3 expression correlated with poor overall survival and increased autophagy-associated markers. CONCLUSION: ASIC3 is a central regulator of acidosis-driven drug persistence in MPE-associated NSCLC, sustaining osimertinib tolerance through PLCG1-dependent macropinocytosis and metabolic reprogramming. Targeting ASIC3 restores TKI sensitivity by disrupting nutrient acquisition, autophagy, and metabolic adaptation, representing a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent or delay EGFR-TKI resistance.",background nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc frequent develop resist egfrtyrosin kinas inhibitor tki particularli malign pleural effus mpe highli acid tumor microenviron promot emerg drugtoler persist dtp cell build upon previou evid mpe acid drive metabol plastic studi investig acidsens ion channel 3 asic3 coordin plcg1depend macropinocytosi maintain osimertinib toler method primari mpederiv nsclc cultur underw nextgener sequenc defin mutat heterogen acid ph 6568 condit use gener osimertinibinduc dtp osidtp model function assay assess viabil invas coloni format autophagi macropinocytosi asic3 silenc use shrna follow seahors metabol analysi transcriptom profil identifi differenti express gene asic3target therapeut intervent evalu vitro xenograft model result mpederiv nsclc cultur show substanti genom divers includ egfr exon 19 delet t790m mutat acidadapt osidtp cell exhibit emtlik phenotyp reduc prolifer elev stem marker strong activ stressrespons pathway asic3 consist upregul acid condit drove plcg1mediat macropinocytosi support nutrient scaveng surviv asic3 knockdown markedli reduc dtp cell viabil invas coloni format autophagi glycolysi induc metabol shift toward oxid phosphoryl vivo combin asic3 inhibitor osimertinib significantli delay tumor progress improv surviv without ad toxic clinic high asic3 express correl poor overal surviv increas autophagyassoci marker conclus asic3 central regul acidosisdriven drug persist mpeassoci nsclc sustain osimertinib toler plcg1depend macropinocytosi metabol reprogram target asic3 restor tki sensit disrupt nutrient acquisit autophagi metabol adapt repres promis therapeut strategi prevent delay egfrtki resist
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Limited data exist on the safety of biologic agents in psoriasis patients with cancer, leading guidelines to recommend against their use within five years of cancer history. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of biologic therapies in psoriasis patients with active or recent (</=5 years) cancer. METHODS: A surveillance study of 333 cases with psoriasis and active cancer or a recent cancer history. Patients treated with conventional systemic agents served as comparators. Co-primary outcomes included progression- or recurrence-free survival (PFS/RFS) and the incidence of severe infections. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 6 years, progression/recurrence rates per 100 patient-years were 10.7 (biologics) and 10.5 (conventional). The cumulative 1-year PFS/RFS was 86% in both groups (p=0.89). Overall, biologics did not affect cancer progression (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.59-1.77; P = .94). Predictors of progression or recurrence included impaired functional status, advanced cancer stage (HR per stage increment, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.21-1.82; P < .001), and higher comorbidity burden.

cancer,"Unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) exhibits substantial heterogeneity and complexity. The landmark LAURA and POLESTAR studies have established a standard therapeutic model involving targeted consolidation therapy with osimertinib or aumolertinib after definitive chemoradiotherapy for NSCLC patients harboring EGFR-sensitive mutations. However, treatment strategies for patients with other driver gene mutations (e.g., ALK fusions, ROS1 rearrangement) still lack robust support from high-level evidence-based medical study. To enhance the standardization of diagnosis and treatment for unresectable stage III driver-positive NSCLC patients, the Radiotherapy Committee of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology convened an expert working group. This group identified common clinical practice issues and conducted an in-depth, problem-oriented analysis of domestic and international guidelines alongside evidence-based medical data. Through multiple rounds of comprehensive discussion and expert voting, this consensus was jointly developed. It provides evidence-based recommendations addressing frequently encountered clinical questions regarding unresectable stage III driver-positive NSCLC, aiming to serve as a key reference for clinical practice.",unresect stage iii nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc exhibit substanti heterogen complex landmark laura polestar studi establish standard therapeut model involv target consolid therapi osimertinib aumolertinib definit chemoradiotherapi nsclc patient harbor egfrsensit mutat howev treatment strategi patient driver gene mutat eg alk fusion ros1 rearrang still lack robust support highlevel evidencebas medic studi enhanc standard diagnosi treatment unresect stage iii driverposit nsclc patient radiotherapi committe chines societi clinic oncolog conven expert work group group identifi common clinic practic issu conduct indepth problemori analysi domest intern guidelin alongsid evidencebas medic data multipl round comprehens discuss expert vote consensu jointli develop provid evidencebas recommend address frequent encount clinic question regard unresect stage iii driverposit nsclc aim serv key refer clinic practic
cancer,"Breast cancer is closely associated with the hormonal sensitization that the mammary gland (MG) undergoes. We evaluated the effects of endogenous (E2) and synthetic (EE2) estrogens, commonly used as hormonal therapies during menopause, in a context of a pro-carcinogenic environment of endocrine disruption. This scenario was modeled to mimic the menopausal involution of the MG during aging in the Mongolian gerbil experimental model under previous bisphenol A exposure, during pregnancy and lactation. Our findings revealed significant remodeling of the epithelial compartment, characterized by increased branching density and loss of normal features, including decreased CD117+ luminal cells and loss of E-cadherin expression. Hormonal therapy with E2 or EE2 led to the development of epithelial lesions, characterized by an increase in invasive microcarcinomas and a decrease in basal (p63+alpha-SMA-) and myoepithelial (p63+alpha-SMA+) progenitor cells, contributing to increased neoplastic invasiveness. These changes were orchestrated by overexpression of EZH2 and a decrease in BRCA1, indicating a poor prognosis, especially for EE2. Furthermore, an imbalance between proliferation (PH-H3(+) cells) and apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3) was observed in the MG of females treated with E2 and EE2. Additionally, distinct hormone receptor profiles were identified, with consistent upregulation of ERalpha and concomitant downregulation of ERbeta and PR, particularly in EE2-treated MG. These alterations may contribute to the observed dysregulation of proliferation and apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that estrogenic hormonal therapies promote neoplastic progression of the aging MG previously subjected to endocrine disruption.",breast cancer close associ hormon sensit mammari gland mg undergo evalu effect endogen e2 synthet ee2 estrogen commonli use hormon therapi menopaus context procarcinogen environ endocrin disrupt scenario model mimic menopaus involut mg age mongolian gerbil experiment model previou bisphenol exposur pregnanc lactat find reveal signific remodel epitheli compart character increas branch densiti loss normal featur includ decreas cd117 lumin cell loss ecadherin express hormon therapi e2 ee2 led develop epitheli lesion character increas invas microcarcinoma decreas basal p63alphasma myoepitheli p63alphasma progenitor cell contribut increas neoplast invas chang orchestr overexpress ezh2 decreas brca1 indic poor prognosi especi ee2 furthermor imbal prolifer phh3 cell apoptosi cleav caspas 3 observ mg femal treat e2 ee2 addit distinct hormon receptor profil identifi consist upregul eralpha concomit downregul erbeta pr particularli ee2treat mg alter may contribut observ dysregul prolifer apoptosi result demonstr estrogen hormon therapi promot neoplast progress age mg previous subject endocrin disrupt
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Sexual dysfunction after cancer is a common but underrecognized sequelae of breast and gynecologic cancer treatment. Many patients experience symptoms of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), including vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and diminished sexual desire. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive, evidence-based approach to management. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus to identify peer-reviewed studies published within the last 30 years. The search incorporated Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords related to sexual dysfunction and cancer survivorship, including terms such as ""sexual dysfunction,"" ""dyspareunia,"" ""vaginal dryness,"" ""vaginal hormone therapy,"" ""breast cancer survivors,"" and ""low desire."" METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they examined sexual dysfunction in cancer patients or survivors, were published in English, and addressed either physiological or psychological aspects of sexual health. Articles were excluded if they lacked methodological rigor. An initial screening of titles and abstracts was followed by full-text review to determine relevance and inclusion. TABULATION: Findings were synthesized using thematic analysis, with studies grouped by cancer type, treatment modality, and impact on sexual function. Although no formal quality assessment tool was applied, emphasis was placed on high-impact studies and comprehensive reviews published in reputable journals. INTEGRATION AND RESULTS: Effective management of GSM includes non-hormonal options such as minimizing irritants, vaginal moisturizers, lubricants, the use of dilators, and pelvic floor therapies. Local hormonal therapies may offer relief for select patients depending on the hormone-sensitivity of their cancer diagnosis. For low sexual desire, psychological and pharmacological agents such as bremelanotide and flibanserin have demonstrated efficacy. Vaginal lasers and compounded hormones pose significant risks to these patient populations and should be avoided. Multidisciplinary approaches, incorporating gynecologic, psychological, and oncologic expertise, are essential for optimizing patient outcomes. CONCLUSION: Sexual dysfunction following breast and gynecologic cancer requires individualized, multimodal management. A combination of non-hormonal and hormonal therapies, behavioral interventions, and emerging pharmacologic treatments offers promising avenues for improving sexual health and overall quality of life in survivors. Future research should focus on the effects of specific cancer therapies on sexual health, investigate the role of biological markers and dysfunction, and refine more personalized approaches to care.",object sexual dysfunct cancer common underrecogn sequela breast gynecolog cancer treatment mani patient experi symptom genitourinari syndrom menopaus gsm includ vagin dryness dyspareunia diminish sexual desir address challeng requir comprehens evidencebas approach manag data sourc comprehens literatur search conduct use pubm googl scholar scopu identifi peerreview studi publish within last 30 year search incorpor medic subject head mesh keyword relat sexual dysfunct cancer survivorship includ term sexual dysfunct dyspareunia vagin dryness vagin hormon therapi breast cancer survivor low desir method studi select studi includ examin sexual dysfunct cancer patient survivor publish english address either physiolog psycholog aspect sexual health articl exclud lack methodolog rigor initi screen titl abstract follow fulltext review determin relev inclus tabul find synthes use themat analysi studi group cancer type treatment modal impact sexual function although formal qualiti assess tool appli emphasi place highimpact studi comprehens review publish reput journal integr result effect manag gsm includ nonhormon option minim irrit vagin moistur lubric use dilat pelvic floor therapi local hormon therapi may offer relief select patient depend hormonesensit cancer diagnosi low sexual desir psycholog pharmacolog agent bremelanotid flibanserin demonstr efficaci vagin laser compound hormon pose signific risk patient popul avoid multidisciplinari approach incorpor gynecolog psycholog oncolog expertis essenti optim patient outcom conclus sexual dysfunct follow breast gynecolog cancer requir individu multimod manag combin nonhormon hormon therapi behavior intervent emerg pharmacolog treatment offer promis avenu improv sexual health overal qualiti life survivor futur research focu effect specif cancer therapi sexual health investig role biolog marker dysfunct refin person approach care
cancer,"Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity is a common adverse event induced by anti-cancer drugs; however, the information of the correlations in vitro to in vivo regarding GI toxicity is limited. The objective of this study was elucidating the usefulness of animal small intestinal organoids using DS-2087b, a novel epidermal growth factor receptor/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 exon 20 insertion inhibitor. Mice showed no DS-2087b-related GI toxicities up to 100mg/kg in 28-day repeated oral toxicity studies, while monkeys exhibited diarrhea at 10mg/kg, along with histopathological changes including intestinal atrophy/erosion at 30 and 100mg/kg. To clarify the mechanisms involved in interspecies differences, cell viability and transcriptomic analysis were performed using mouse and monkey small intestinal organoids generated from adult stem cells treated with DS-2087b at 0-10,000nM for 3 days. Cell viability in monkey small intestinal organoids treated with DS-2087b at 1000 and 10,000nM was significantly decreased compared to that of mice. In the transcriptomic analysis, expression of stem- and Paneth-cell marker genes was markedly decreased in the monkey small intestinal organoids. In conclusion, the intestinal organoids are valuable in vivo-in vitro translation of drug-induced GI toxicity and the changes in specific cell-type composition induced by DS-2087b may be important factors for contributing the interspecies differences.",gastrointestin gi toxic common advers event induc anticanc drug howev inform correl vitro vivo regard gi toxic limit object studi elucid use anim small intestin organoid use ds2087b novel epiderm growth factor receptorhuman epiderm growth factor receptor 2 exon 20 insert inhibitor mice show ds2087brelat gi toxic 100mgkg 28day repeat oral toxic studi monkey exhibit diarrhea 10mgkg along histopatholog chang includ intestin atrophyeros 30 100mgkg clarifi mechan involv interspeci differ cell viabil transcriptom analysi perform use mous monkey small intestin organoid gener adult stem cell treat ds2087b 010000nm 3 day cell viabil monkey small intestin organoid treat ds2087b 1000 10000nm significantli decreas compar mice transcriptom analysi express stem panethcel marker gene markedli decreas monkey small intestin organoid conclus intestin organoid valuabl vivoin vitro translat druginduc gi toxic chang specif celltyp composit induc ds2087b may import factor contribut interspeci differ
cancer,"Cancer cachexia is characterized by a significant loss in body weight due to the wasting of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Systemic inflammation has long been associated with cachexia, with various tumor secreted factors shown to correlate with as well as cause tissue wasting. In addition to systemic inflammation, it has become increasingly appreciated that inflammation occurs in specific tissues in cancer cachexia, with tissues such as muscle, adipose, liver and brain being affected. While several studies have shown that this local tissue inflammation contributes to cachexia, there is evidence that some aspects of the inflammatory response may play a protective role to mitigate tissue wasting. Here, we will review the findings on local tissue inflammation in cachexia, comparing the impacts of such inflammation on tissue wasting and cachexia progression overall. Furthermore, we discuss the methods used to mitigate inflammation in various tissues and highlight the outcomes on the cachectic phenotype. Collectively, understanding how inflammation contributes to cachexia in each tissue will ultimately influence how therapies can be designed to treat cachexia while minimizing possible adverse side effects.",cancer cachexia character signific loss bodi weight due wast skelet muscl adipos tissu system inflamm long associ cachexia variou tumor secret factor shown correl well caus tissu wast addit system inflamm becom increasingli appreci inflamm occur specif tissu cancer cachexia tissu muscl adipos liver brain affect sever studi shown local tissu inflamm contribut cachexia evid aspect inflammatori respons may play protect role mitig tissu wast review find local tissu inflamm cachexia compar impact inflamm tissu wast cachexia progress overal furthermor discuss method use mitig inflamm variou tissu highlight outcom cachect phenotyp collect understand inflamm contribut cachexia tissu ultim influenc therapi design treat cachexia minim possibl advers side effect
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Accurate toxicity assessment is critical in oncology trials, yet current reporting frameworks such as the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) remain labor-intensive and subject to inter-observer variability. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential to automate extraction and grading of adverse events from clinical notes and patient-reported outcomes (PROs), but their comparative performance and cost-effectiveness remain underexplored. METHODS: We evaluated five off-the-shelf LLMs (Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, and GPT-5) using a rule-augmented few-shot prompting strategy to extract CTCAE-graded gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities from a prospective prostate radiotherapy trial (NCT02874014; n = 55 patients, 8968 toxicity records). Binary and grade-level accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, Cohen's kappa, and computational costs were assessed. RESULTS: All models achieved high binary accuracy (84.6-87.4 %) and moderate grade accuracy (79.1-82.3 %). GPT-4o reached the best binary (87.4 %) and grade (83.5 %) accuracy, while Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated highest sensitivity (74.0 %). Specificity peaked with GPT-4o (96.0 %). Cohen's kappa values indicated moderate agreement (0.552-0.560 for binary; 0.401-0.465 for grades). Costs for the entire extraction varied substantially: Gemini 2.0 Flash delivered competitive accuracy at $0.77 total, whereas Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 exceeded $21. CONCLUSIONS: Off-the-shelf LLMs can extract clinically relevant toxicities with performance approaching human inter-rater reliability, at variable but often negligible costs. While grade-level accuracy remains limited, LLM integration into oncology workflows is feasible, offering scalable, low-cost support for toxicity monitoring and data abstraction in clinical research.",background accur toxic assess critic oncolog trial yet current report framework common terminolog criteria advers event ctcae remain laborintens subject interobserv variabl larg languag model llm offer potenti autom extract grade advers event clinic note patientreport outcom pro compar perform costeffect remain underexplor method evalu five offtheshelf llm gemini 20 flash gemini 25 flash gemini 25 pro gpt4o gpt5 use ruleaug fewshot prompt strategi extract ctcaegrad gastrointestin genitourinari toxic prospect prostat radiotherapi trial nct02874014 n 55 patient 8968 toxic record binari gradelevel accuraci precis recal specif f1 score cohen kappa comput cost assess result model achiev high binari accuraci 846874 moder grade accuraci 791823 gpt4o reach best binari 874 grade 835 accuraci gemini 25 pro demonstr highest sensit 740 specif peak gpt4o 960 cohen kappa valu indic moder agreement 05520560 binari 04010465 grade cost entir extract vari substanti gemini 20 flash deliv competit accuraci 077 total wherea gemini 25 pro gpt5 exceed 21 conclus offtheshelf llm extract clinic relev toxic perform approach human interrat reliabl variabl often neglig cost gradelevel accuraci remain limit llm integr oncolog workflow feasibl offer scalabl lowcost support toxic monitor data abstract clinic research
cancer,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) exhibits aggressive invasion with limited treatment options. This study investigates the oncolytic potential of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) against OSCC and explores its ability to induce ferroptosis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) highlighted CVB3's efficacy in initiating ferroptosis, placing the pathogen as a hopeful option in cancer treatment. We demonstrated CVB3 infection significantly inhibited OSCC cell proliferation and tumor growth in mouse models. Biochemical tests verified ferroptosis activation, marked by increased Fe(2+), lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, alongside decreased glutathione (GSH). These effects were reversed by ferroptosis inhibitors. Mechanistically, CVB3 downregulated circ_0010074 and its target Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), while upregulating miR-214-3p. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and luciferase assays, we found circ_0010074 sequesters miR-214-3p to regulate GPX4 expression. Our research demonstrates that CVB3 acts as a highly effective oncolytic virus in targeting OSCC, inducing ferroptosis via the previously unrecognized circ_0010074/miR-214-3p/GPX4 pathway.

cancer,"OBJECTIVES: Breast cancer poses a global burden on individuals and healthcare systems, with millions of women undergoing surgery annually. Recently, there has been growing recognition of the importance of patient-centered care, leading to increased interest in Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs). In oncology, this has translated into the use of validated tools such as the BREAST-Q survey, which is designed for a range of breast surgery procedures, and it is specifically applicable in breast cancer. Using BREAST-Q data collected at the University Hospital of Pisa (Italy) between 2018 and 2022 from a sample of 482 women, this study explores the causal relationship between the pre-operative information provided by the breast surgeon and patients' post-surgery satisfaction. METHODS: We employ Item Response Theory models to estimate patient-level satisfaction with pre-surgery information and with breast outcomes. Using these estimated latent traits, we assess the causal effect of satisfaction with pre-surgery information on post-surgery breast satisfaction through an exposure-response curve, accounting for various pre-exposure individual characteristics. RESULTS: Findings show a strong, positive, and statistically significant causal relationship between pre-operative information and post-operative satisfaction.

However, while RCD subroutines-such as apoptosis, autophagy, pyroptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis-are fundamental for health, their dysregulation can be detrimental, potentially triggering or contributing to a variety of diseases. As a result, the modulation of RCD has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for numerous conditions, including infectious, neurodegenerative, autoimmune, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Over the past two decades, innovative experimental approaches for modulating RCD have proliferated in medicinal research. In parallel, a growing array of online resources-such as databases, web servers, machine learning (ML) /artificial intelligence (AI) models, omics technologies, and systems biology networks, collectively referred to as ""in silico methods""-has become available to accelerate research progress. AIM OF REVIEW: Recognizing the potential of these online resources, we have compiled a comprehensive overview of relevant in silico approaches to RCD, aiming to facilitate their effective use in the development of future therapeutic interventions. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: RCD-associated databases serve as the foundational data infrastructure for in silico methods, encompassing extensive biological information spanning DNA, RNA, proteins, small molecules, and disease-related data. The continuous curation and expansion of these databases are crucial for elucidating various cell death modalities and visually characterizing the functional dynamics of target molecules across different pathological conditions. Through the integration of AI, ML, multi-omics technologies, and systems biology approaches, we can systematically decode the intricate regulatory networks of RCD and disease progression patterns. This interdisciplinary convergence significantly enhances the discovery pipeline for disease-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",background regul cell death rcd essenti organism develop play key role organ format pathogen defens mainten homeostasi howev rcd subroutinessuch apoptosi autophagi pyroptosi necroptosi ferroptosisar fundament health dysregul detriment potenti trigger contribut varieti diseas result modul rcd emerg promis therapeut strategi numer condit includ infecti neurodegen autoimmun cardiovascular diseas cancer past two decad innov experiment approach modul rcd prolifer medicin research parallel grow array onlin resourcessuch databas web server machin learn ml artifici intellig ai model omic technolog system biolog network collect refer silico methodsha becom avail acceler research progress aim review recogn potenti onlin resourc compil comprehens overview relev silico approach rcd aim facilit effect use develop futur therapeut intervent key scientif concept review rcdassoci databas serv foundat data infrastructur silico method encompass extens biolog inform span dna rna protein small molecul diseaserel data continu curat expans databas crucial elucid variou cell death modal visual character function dynam target molecul across differ patholog condit integr ai ml multiom technolog system biolog approach systemat decod intric regulatori network rcd diseas progress pattern interdisciplinari converg significantli enhanc discoveri pipelin diseasespecif biomark therapeut target
cancer,"Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators in cancer progression, yet their mechanistic roles in gastric cancer (GC) remain poorly understood. Here, we identify SNORA21 as an oncogenic snoRNA that drives GC pathogenesis through P53 pathway inactivation. We demonstrated significant SNORA21 upregulation in GC tissues and cell lines compared to normal controls. Functional studies revealed that SNORA21 knockdown inhibited tumor growth, while its overexpression promoted malignant phenotypes, establishing its crucial role in determining GC cell fate. Transcriptomic profiling and mechanistic investigations uncovered that SNORA21 represses P53 tumor suppressor activity through a novel CHK1-dependent mechanism. Specifically, SNORA21 attenuated DNA damage responses by inhibiting CHK1 phosphorylation, thereby preventing P53 activation. Remarkably, SNORA21 depletion triggered PERP induction - a P53 effector - which formed a positive feedback loop by suppressing MDM2-mediated P53 degradation. This dual regulatory mechanism (CHK1 inhibition and PERP-MDM2 feedback) explains how SNORA21 sustains P53 inactivation in GC cells. In vivo xenograft models confirmed that SNORA21 silencing suppressed tumor growth while enhancing P53 signaling activity. Our work not only elucidates SNORA21 as a master regulator of the P53 pathway in GC but also reveals its therapeutic potential. The discovery of the SNORA21-CHK1-PERP-MDM2 axis provides a conceptual framework for targeting snoRNA-mediated P53 regulation in GC treatment. These findings position SNORA21 as both a prognostic biomarker and a candidate for RNA-based therapeutics in P53-wildtype gastric cancers.",small nucleolar rna snorna emerg critic regul cancer progress yet mechanist role gastric cancer gc remain poorli understood identifi snora21 oncogen snorna drive gc pathogenesi p53 pathway inactiv demonstr signific snora21 upregul gc tissu cell line compar normal control function studi reveal snora21 knockdown inhibit tumor growth overexpress promot malign phenotyp establish crucial role determin gc cell fate transcriptom profil mechanist investig uncov snora21 repress p53 tumor suppressor activ novel chk1depend mechan specif snora21 attenu dna damag respons inhibit chk1 phosphoryl therebi prevent p53 activ remark snora21 deplet trigger perp induct p53 effector form posit feedback loop suppress mdm2mediat p53 degrad dual regulatori mechan chk1 inhibit perpmdm2 feedback explain snora21 sustain p53 inactiv gc cell vivo xenograft model confirm snora21 silenc suppress tumor growth enhanc p53 signal activ work elucid snora21 master regul p53 pathway gc also reveal therapeut potenti discoveri snora21chk1perpmdm2 axi provid conceptu framework target snornamedi p53 regul gc treatment find posit snora21 prognost biomark candid rnabas therapeut p53wildtyp gastric cancer
cancer,"Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Aberrant canonical Wnt signaling is a hallmark of this cancer type. It has been reported that LPA is a bioactive lipid that plays different roles in colon cancer by activating its G-protein-coupled receptors, promoting cell proliferation, migration, survival, and angiogenesis. Although it has been reported that LPA activates canonical Wnt signaling, the mechanisms underlying their interaction remain unclear; this study aims to investigate them. As previously reported, LPA receptor expression changes under malignant conditions: while LPA(1) is expressed at high levels and LPA(2) is low in non-malignant 112CoN cells, the opposite occurs in malignant cells, with colon cancer cells showing low LPA(1) levels and high LPA(2) levels. We also observed that both LPA and Wnt-3a induce strong ERK activation in all colon cell lines; these effects are not additive. Additionally, LPA and Wnt-3a stimulate beta-catenin transcriptional activity and its phosphorylation at residues S552 and S675, again in a non-additive manner. We further found that LPA(2) and the Wnt effectors Dvl2 and Dvl3 co-precipitate in colon cancer cells, and that the PDZ-interacting motif in the carboxyl terminus of the LPA(2) receptor is critical for their direct interaction. Moreover, expressing a mutated LPA(2-)PDZminus receptor inhibited cell migration while increasing proliferation. Remarkably, the LPA(2-)PDZminus receptor negatively affected its ability to activate canonical Wnt signaling and unexpectedly, it also impaired the Wnt-3a ligand-induced activation of canonical Wnt signaling in colon cancer cells.",colorect cancer third lead caus cancerrel death worldwid aberr canon wnt signal hallmark cancer type report lpa bioactiv lipid play differ role colon cancer activ gproteincoupl receptor promot cell prolifer migrat surviv angiogenesi although report lpa activ canon wnt signal mechan underli interact remain unclear studi aim investig previous report lpa receptor express chang malign condit lpa1 express high level lpa2 low nonmalign 112con cell opposit occur malign cell colon cancer cell show low lpa1 level high lpa2 level also observ lpa wnt3a induc strong erk activ colon cell line effect addit addit lpa wnt3a stimul betacatenin transcript activ phosphoryl residu s552 s675 nonaddit manner found lpa2 wnt effector dvl2 dvl3 coprecipit colon cancer cell pdzinteract motif carboxyl terminu lpa2 receptor critic direct interact moreov express mutat lpa2pdzminu receptor inhibit cell migrat increas prolifer remark lpa2pdzminu receptor neg affect abil activ canon wnt signal unexpectedli also impair wnt3a ligandinduc activ canon wnt signal colon cancer cell
cancer,"Lung cancer is one of the most life-threatening malignant tumors. The progression of tumors driven by chemo-radiotherapy resistance is the primary determinant of poor clinical outcomes, highlighting the crucial need for mechanistic insights into resistance pathways. In this study, we uncover that Lysine Acetyltransferase 7 (KAT7) overexpression not only promotes non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo but also confers resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which has been previously underexplored in NSCLC. Mechanistically, KAT7 forms a positive feedback loop with long non-coding RNA PVT1 (lncPVT1) and regulates the H3K14ac/HDGF axis and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which the mutual regulation of KAT7, lncPVT1, and HDGF drives the proliferation and chemo-radiotherapy resistance of NSCLC.",lung cancer one lifethreaten malign tumor progress tumor driven chemoradiotherapi resist primari determin poor clinic outcom highlight crucial need mechanist insight resist pathway studi uncov lysin acetyltransferas 7 kat7 overexpress promot nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc cell prolifer vitro tumor growth vivo also confer resist chemotherapi radiotherapi previous underexplor nsclc mechanist kat7 form posit feedback loop long noncod rna pvt1 lncpvt1 regul h3k14achdgf axi pi3kakt signal pathway studi aim elucid molecular mechan mutual regul kat7 lncpvt1 hdgf drive prolifer chemoradiotherapi resist nsclc
cancer,"Developing multifunctional biomaterials capable of supporting diverse therapeutic applications remains a major challenge in regenerative medicine. In this study, semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi-IPN) hydrogels composed of collagen (C), polyurethane (PU), and maltodextrin (MD) were synthesized to investigate the influence of MD content (0-50 wt%) on their physicochemical and biological performance. The hydrogels exhibited an amorphous morphology with embedded MD granules, enhanced swelling capacity (up to 1100 %), and reduced crosslinking density at higher MD contents. Formulations containing 20-30 wt% MD demonstrated improved mechanical strength (G' = 267 Pa), higher thermal stability, and slower degradation under pH 5.5, pH 7.4, and simulated body fluid conditions. Increasing MD concentrations (30-50 wt%) promoted the metabolic activity of monocytes, fibroblasts, and bone-derived cells (up to 130-150 % relative to control), while exerting antiproliferative effects against colon cancer cells (notably at 40 wt% MD, with 56 % of viability). The CPU-MD30 hydrogel stimulated IL-10 secretion, whereas 10 wt% MD maintained baseline MCP-1 levels. Hydrogels exhibited excellent hemocompatibility and antibacterial activity, inhibiting E. coli by 93 % and S. aureus by 58 %, likely arising from oxidized maltodextrin byproducts and polyurethane segments that disrupt bacterial membranes. Drug release assays confirmed pH-sensitive release profiles for ketorolac and methylene blue. Hydrogels with higher MD content accelerated in vitro wound closure (by up to 15 days) and promoted surface mineralization by forming carbonated hydroxyapatite, confirming their osteoconductive potential. These CPU-MD hydrogels demonstrate strong potential as bioactive scaffolds for soft- and hard-tissue regeneration, immunomodulation, controlled drug delivery, and selective cancer therapy.",develop multifunct biomateri capabl support divers therapeut applic remain major challeng regen medicin studi semiinterpenetr polym network semiipn hydrogel compos collagen c polyurethan pu maltodextrin md synthes investig influenc md content 050 wt physicochem biolog perform hydrogel exhibit amorph morpholog embed md granul enhanc swell capac 1100 reduc crosslink densiti higher md content formul contain 2030 wt md demonstr improv mechan strength g 267 pa higher thermal stabil slower degrad ph 55 ph 74 simul bodi fluid condit increas md concentr 3050 wt promot metabol activ monocyt fibroblast bonederiv cell 130150 rel control exert antiprolif effect colon cancer cell notabl 40 wt md 56 viabil cpumd30 hydrogel stimul il10 secret wherea 10 wt md maintain baselin mcp1 level hydrogel exhibit excel hemocompat antibacteri activ inhibit e coli 93 aureu 58 like aris oxid maltodextrin byproduct polyurethan segment disrupt bacteri membran drug releas assay confirm phsensit releas profil ketorolac methylen blue hydrogel higher md content acceler vitro wound closur 15 day promot surfac miner form carbon hydroxyapatit confirm osteoconduct potenti cpumd hydrogel demonstr strong potenti bioactiv scaffold soft hardtissu regener immunomodul control drug deliveri select cancer therapi
cancer,"Cancer remains one of the most formidable global public health challenges, exerting a profound and detrimental impact on human health. Despite substantial advancements in cancer research, the escalating incidence and mortality rates underscore the persistent and growing burden on global healthcare systems. The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas system, heralded as a revolutionary gene-editing tool, holds immense promise for cancer treatment. However, its efficacy is critically contingent upon developing efficient delivery strategies. DNA nanocarriers, characterized by their programmability, sequence specificity, and design flexibility, emerge as a highly effective vehicle for delivering the CRISPR/Cas system, facilitating the precise transportation of gene-editing tools to the cell nucleus. The integration of DNA nanocarriers with CRISPR/Cas technology provides a new paradigm for precise and controllable gene editing. Through programmable spatial assembly, DNA nanocarriers can protect Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexs (RNPs), facilitate endosomal escape, and co-localize donor DNA to promote homology-directed repair. These synergistic effects bridge molecular programmability and genetic functionality, paving the way for safer and more efficient genome engineering. This review aims to evaluate the application of DNA nanocarriers in cancer diagnosis comprehensively and to explore their potential utility in cancer therapy when combined with the CRISPR/Cas system, offering novel insights and significant scientific contributions to the field.",cancer remain one formid global public health challeng exert profound detriment impact human health despit substanti advanc cancer research escal incid mortal rate underscor persist grow burden global healthcar system cluster regularli interspac short palindrom repeat crisprca system herald revolutionari geneedit tool hold immens promis cancer treatment howev efficaci critic conting upon develop effici deliveri strategi dna nanocarri character programm sequenc specif design flexibl emerg highli effect vehicl deliv crisprca system facilit precis transport geneedit tool cell nucleu integr dna nanocarri crisprca technolog provid new paradigm precis control gene edit programm spatial assembl dna nanocarri protect cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex rnp facilit endosom escap coloc donor dna promot homologydirect repair synergist effect bridg molecular programm genet function pave way safer effici genom engin review aim evalu applic dna nanocarri cancer diagnosi comprehens explor potenti util cancer therapi combin crisprca system offer novel insight signific scientif contribut field
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its efficacy remains limited. Recent studies demonstrate that resistance to ferroptosis is a significant barrier to the success of ICB. METHODS: Ferroptosis was assessed by measuring C11-BODIPY fluorescence and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) staining. Epigenetic regulation of hepcidin under fatty acid-rich conditions in HCC cells was investigated through chromatin immunoprecipitation and histone methylation analyses. Clinical relevance was evaluated using ICB response datasets and analyses of tumor tissues from HCC patients. RESULTS: We demonstrate that prolonged exposure to high palmitate concentrations induces ferroptosis resistance in HCC cells by altering glutamine availability. Mechanistically, chronic exposure to palmitate and high-fat diet-feeding reduced glutamine-derived alpha-KG concentrations in HCC cells, leading to a H3K27me3-mediated reduction in hepcidin and depletion of the intracellular labile iron pool, thereby promoting resistance to anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1)-induced ferroptosis. This resistance was reversed by the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat, which epigenetically restored hepcidin expression in both in vitro and in vivo models. Notably, tumor tissues from HCC patients exhibited high FFA levels, along with low levels of glutamine, hepcidin, and iron, which correlated with shorter overall survival. H3K27me3-mediated suppression of hepcidin was further confirmed in patient cohorts. CONCLUSION: Our study uncovers a previously unrecognized type of palmitate-induced metabolic reprogramming that confers resistance to ICB-induced ferroptosis on HCC, and propose a therapeutic strategy to overcome ferroptosis resistance under free fatty acid-rich conditions.",background immun checkpoint blockad icb revolution treatment hepatocellular carcinoma hcc efficaci remain limit recent studi demonstr resist ferroptosi signific barrier success icb method ferroptosi assess measur c11bodipi fluoresc 4hydroxynonen 4hne stain epigenet regul hepcidin fatti acidrich condit hcc cell investig chromatin immunoprecipit histon methyl analys clinic relev evalu use icb respons dataset analys tumor tissu hcc patient result demonstr prolong exposur high palmit concentr induc ferroptosi resist hcc cell alter glutamin avail mechanist chronic exposur palmit highfat dietfeed reduc glutaminederiv alphakg concentr hcc cell lead h3k27me3medi reduct hepcidin deplet intracellular labil iron pool therebi promot resist antiprogram deathligand 1 antipdl1induc ferroptosi resist revers ezh2 inhibitor tazemetostat epigenet restor hepcidin express vitro vivo model notabl tumor tissu hcc patient exhibit high ffa level along low level glutamin hepcidin iron correl shorter overal surviv h3k27me3medi suppress hepcidin confirm patient cohort conclus studi uncov previous unrecogn type palmitateinduc metabol reprogram confer resist icbinduc ferroptosi hcc propos therapeut strategi overcom ferroptosi resist free fatti acidrich condit
cancer,"Exosomes are nanoscale extracellular vesicles that mediate critical intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent advancements reveal that exosome populations within tumors are not uniform but exhibit significant heterogeneity in their molecular cargo and functional output. This heterogeneity is particularly pronounced in spatially organized tumors, where distinct functional zones, driven by gradients in local stress, perfusion, and metabolic states, orchestrate the release of unique exosome subtypes. These functional zones include stromal, hypoxic, perivascular, quiescent, and immune-cold regions. The zone-specific exosomes deliver specialized molecular cargos, including nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and metabolites, to recipient cells within the TME and at distant sites. This communication promotes tumor sustenance and contributes to drug resistance through diverse mechanisms, such as immune suppression, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), metabolic reprogramming, and the activation of prosurvival signaling pathways. Although bulk exosome analysis has enabled the development of biomarkers for personalized medicine, it often fails to capture these intricate, zone-specific influences. This review explores emerging techniques, including single-cell sequencing, microchip-based 3D tumor cultures, advanced spectroscopic methods, and spatial biology platforms, that are poised to elucidate the spatiotemporal communication networks mediated by zonal exosomes, thereby advancing the understanding of drug resistance mechanisms.",exosom nanoscal extracellular vesicl mediat critic intercellular commun within tumor microenviron tme recent advanc reveal exosom popul within tumor uniform exhibit signific heterogen molecular cargo function output heterogen particularli pronounc spatial organ tumor distinct function zone driven gradient local stress perfus metabol state orchestr releas uniqu exosom subtyp function zone includ stromal hypox perivascular quiescent immunecold region zonespecif exosom deliv special molecular cargo includ nucleic acid protein lipid metabolit recipi cell within tme distant site commun promot tumor susten contribut drug resist divers mechan immun suppress epithelialmesenchym transit emt metabol reprogram activ prosurviv signal pathway although bulk exosom analysi enabl develop biomark person medicin often fail captur intric zonespecif influenc review explor emerg techniqu includ singlecel sequenc microchipbas 3d tumor cultur advanc spectroscop method spatial biolog platform pois elucid spatiotempor commun network mediat zonal exosom therebi advanc understand drug resist mechan
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the current evidence on prostate biopsy litigation risks, we analyze malpractice litigations related to prostate biopsies using a national legal database. METHODS: We utilized the LexisNexis Database to retrospectively analyze prostate biopsy malpractice lawsuits. We searched for keywords ""prostate"", ""malpractice"", and ""biopsy"" from January 1, 1995 to March 30, 2025. We focused on cases where the allegation of malpractice was specific to the biopsy, excluding cases addressing other aspects of prostate cancer care. We then reviewed case characteristics including type of biopsy, location, instigating injuries, allegations, verdict, and plaintiff award. RESULTS: We found 360 unique lawsuits, 24 of which met the inclusion criteria. 9 lawsuits involved transrectal prostate biopsy, while the rest were unspecified types. Out of the 47 instigating injuries named, the most common were infection (9/47), acute or chronic pain after biopsy (6/47), and erectile dysfunction (4/47), LUTS (4/47), and bleeding (4/47). 18 cases (75.0%) resulted in defendant verdict, while 1 (4%) resulted in plaintiff verdict with an award of $226,795.00. 1 case (4%) resulted in private settlement of unknown amount. 2 lawsuits (8%) were ongoing at the time of the study, and 2 (8%) had undocumented verdicts. CONCLUSIONS: Despite wide utilization of prostate biopsy in the past 30 years, prostate biopsy lawsuits were rare at the federal and state court levels.

cancer,"Hypoxia plays a crucial role in the advancement of colorectal cancer (CRC); however, the downstream mechanisms facilitated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) remain incompletely understood. This study employed in vitro and in vivo models to investigate the role of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) under hypoxic conditions in CRC. Utilizing reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis, we observed an upregulation of TCF7L2 mRNA and protein expression in Caco-2 and HCT-116 CRC cell lines under hypoxia. Functional assays, including CCK-8, colony and sphere formation, Transwell, flow cytometry, and xenograft tumor models, provided evidence that the knockdown of TCF7L2 leads to the suppression of CRC cell proliferation, the induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, and a decrease in migration and invasion capabilities. Furthermore, it inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSC) characteristics in vitro, while also reducing tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays have elucidated that the expression of TCF7L2 induced by hypoxia is dependent on HIF-1alpha, which directly binds to hypoxia response elements (HREs) within the TCF7L2 promoter. Additionally, Western blot and experiments employing the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 have demonstrated that TCF7L2 activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thereby facilitating the proliferation of CRC cells. A clinical analysis of 104 CRC specimens, utilizing immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RT-qPCR, revealed that elevated expression levels of TCF7L2 were significantly associated with advanced T stage, metastasis, and unfavorable prognosis. Spearman correlation analysis confirmed a positive relationship between the expressions of TCF7L2 and HIF-1alpha, while Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that their co-expression was predictive of reduced overall survival. Collectively,these findings position TCF7L2 as a critical downstream effector of HIF-1alpha in hypoxic CRC, and its mechanistic role in promoting malignancy and correlation with poor prognosis provide a theoretical basis for exploring TCF7L2 as a potential therapeutic target in future studies..",hypoxia play crucial role advanc colorect cancer crc howev downstream mechan facilit hypoxiainduc factor 1alpha hif1alpha remain incomplet understood studi employ vitro vivo model investig role transcript factor 7like 2 tcf7l2 hypox condit crc util revers transcript quantit polymeras chain reaction rtqpcr western blot analysi observ upregul tcf7l2 mrna protein express caco2 hct116 crc cell line hypoxia function assay includ cck8 coloni sphere format transwel flow cytometri xenograft tumor model provid evid knockdown tcf7l2 lead suppress crc cell prolifer induct apoptosi cell cycl arrest g0g1 phase decreas migrat invas capabl furthermor inhibit epithelialmesenchym transit emt cancer stem cell csc characterist vitro also reduc tumor growth vivo mechanist chromatin immunoprecipit chip coimmunoprecipit coip assay elucid express tcf7l2 induc hypoxia depend hif1alpha directli bind hypoxia respons element hre within tcf7l2 promot addit western blot experi employ pi3k inhibitor ly294002 demonstr tcf7l2 activ pi3kakt signal pathway therebi facilit prolifer crc cell clinic analysi 104 crc specimen util immunohistochemistri ihc rtqpcr reveal elev express level tcf7l2 significantli associ advanc stage metastasi unfavor prognosi spearman correl analysi confirm posit relationship express tcf7l2 hif1alpha kaplanmei surviv analysi demonstr coexpress predict reduc overal surviv collectivelythes find posit tcf7l2 critic downstream effector hif1alpha hypox crc mechanist role promot malign correl poor prognosi provid theoret basi explor tcf7l2 potenti therapeut target futur studi

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Global oral nicotine pouch sales have grown rapidly in recent years, but population-level patterns of use remain poorly described. The aim of this study is to examine recent trends in nicotine pouch use in Great Britain. METHODS: We used data from the Smoking Toolkit Study, a representative monthly cross-sectional survey of tobacco and nicotine use in Great Britain, collected between October, 2020, and March, 2025 (recruiting around 2450 participants per month). Participants were aged 16 years or older (16-17-year-olds included from January, 2022). Nicotine pouch use was self-reported through questions on current use of various nicotine and tobacco products. We estimated trends in the prevalence of current nicotine pouch use, overall and stratified by sociodemographic characteristics and other nicotine product use, as well as trends in the use of pouches to aid quitting smoking. All reported percentages are survey-weighted. FINDINGS: A total of 127 793 individuals were included in this study. Among adults, nicotine pouch use increased from 0.1% (95% CI 0.1-0.2) in October, 2020, to 1.0% (0.8-1.2) in March, 2025. From 2022, increases were concentrated among young people: in 16-24-year-olds, use rose from 0.7% (0.4-1.4) in January, 2022, to 4.0% (2.9-5.5) in March, 2025, with no meaningful change in those aged 35 years and older. Use was higher among men, especially 16-24-year-old men (7.5%, 6.0-9.4 in March, 2025) and those who smoke or vape, but similar across nations and social grades. Among people using pouches surveyed from January, 2022, to March, 2025, 69% (95% CI 65-74) also used other nicotine products; 56% (52-61) smoked, 39% (34-44) vaped, and 16% (12-19) had never smoked regularly. Among people who attempted to quit smoking in the past year, the proportion using pouches in their most recent quit attempt rose from 2.6% (1.0-6.6) in October, 2020, to 6.5% (4.8-8.8) in March, 2025. INTERPRETATION: Nicotine pouch use has risen in Great Britain, primarily driven by sharp increases among young people, especially young men. Most users also smoked or vaped, and a growing proportion of smokers used pouches in attempts to quit smoking. These findings underscore the importance of implementing age-of-sale legislation for nicotine pouches and conducting research on their effectiveness for smoking cessation.

The therapeutic landscape has undergone a large transformation in the past 5 years, resulting in improved patient outcomes. In this Seminar, we review the pathology, diagnostic strategies, and treatments for prostate cancer. Active surveillance is the preferred treatment option for patients with indolent prostate cancer. For those requiring treatment, local therapies provide effective cancer control. Systemic treatment is essential for advanced and metastatic cases, and a wide range of therapies are now available, including androgen deprivation therapy, chemotherapy, and emerging targeted agents such as lutetium-177-labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen radioligand therapy and PARP inhibitors. Considering toxicity profiles alongside patient preferences is important to facilitating shared decision making. Further research is needed to establish the most effective sequence and combination of treatments for metastatic prostate cancer.",prostat cancer pose substanti clinic challeng account larg proport cancerrel death worldwid therapeut landscap undergon larg transform past 5 year result improv patient outcom seminar review patholog diagnost strategi treatment prostat cancer activ surveil prefer treatment option patient indol prostat cancer requir treatment local therapi provid effect cancer control system treatment essenti advanc metastat case wide rang therapi avail includ androgen depriv therapi chemotherapi emerg target agent lutetium177label prostatespecif membran antigen radioligand therapi parp inhibitor consid toxic profil alongsid patient prefer import facilit share decis make research need establish effect sequenc combin treatment metastat prostat cancer
cancer,"Lacticaseibacillus paracasei strain Shirota (LcS), promotes intestinal homeostasis, modulates immune cells, and provides anti-stress benefits. Four years of BLP (Biolactis powder: LcS preparation) administration is known to suppress the recurrence of highly dysmorphic polyps in participants who underwent colorectal adenoma resection. Furthermore, adenoma development tended to be suppressed in patients undergoing colorectal adenoma resection who consumed BLP for >20 years, accompanied by a reduction in aging weight loss. However, the underlying mechanisms and effects of prolonged BLP intake on gut mucosa and microbiota remain unclear. Hence, we aimed to analyse the gut microbiota and host gene expression in endoscopically obtained colonic mucosal tissue from participants who had been voluntarily consuming BLP for more than 20 years, as well as from non-consumers of BLP. The faecal and mucosal microbiota of the BLP group revealed a high detection rate and abundance of Coprococcus genus and a rich population of butyrate-producing bacteria. Conversely, the mucosa of the control group was enriched in opportunistic pathogens and environmental bacteria, including those from the families Pseudomonadaceae and Brachyspiraceae. RNA-seq of the colon mucosa of BLP-consuming patients revealed high expression of genes related to the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway, including those of the mitochondrial electron transfer system. Additionally, T cell- and G-protein-coupled receptor-related genes were overexpressed in BLP-consuming patients. These findings indicate that prolonged BLP intake increases the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria and activates the OXPHOS pathway in colonic mucosal tissue, which alters the enteroenvironment and limits colonisation by opportunistic pathogens. These findings may contribute to the prevention of colorectal cancer development and have implications for promoting healthy longevity.

cancer,"This study explores the role of efferocytosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) using single-cell RNA sequencing and in vitro/in vivo assays. Analyzing 27 samples from 9 patients with ESCC, we identify diverse cell types and significant heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment, with a focus on efferocytosis. Our findings highlight that macrophages engulf apoptotic tumor cells, thereby impairing immune responses and promoting tumor progression. Notably, TP63 and RAC2 emerge as key regulators of this process, influencing efferocytosis and immune modulation. Functional assays demonstrate that disrupting these pathways alters macrophage efferocytosis and impacts tumor growth in vivo. These results suggest that targeting efferocytosis pathways offers potential therapeutic strategies for ESCC, enhancing antitumor immunity and improving patient outcomes. The study underscores the complex interactions between tumor cells and the immune system, with efferocytosis representing a promising therapeutic target.",studi explor role efferocytosi esophag squamou cell carcinoma escc use singlecel rna sequenc vitroin vivo assay analyz 27 sampl 9 patient escc identifi divers cell type signific heterogen tumor microenviron focu efferocytosi find highlight macrophag engulf apoptot tumor cell therebi impair immun respons promot tumor progress notabl tp63 rac2 emerg key regul process influenc efferocytosi immun modul function assay demonstr disrupt pathway alter macrophag efferocytosi impact tumor growth vivo result suggest target efferocytosi pathway offer potenti therapeut strategi escc enhanc antitumor immun improv patient outcom studi underscor complex interact tumor cell immun system efferocytosi repres promis therapeut target

cancer,"Inducing lipid peroxidation-dependent ferroptosis is a promising anticancer strategy; however, the development of resistance poses a considerable challenge. This study identifies peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) as a crucial modulator of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), affecting its localization and functional roles, thus contributing to ferroptosis resistance. PRDX6, endowed with phospholipase A2 activity, catalyzes the conversion of peroxy-phospholipids to lysophospholipids and oxidized fatty acids. Through targeted structural mutations and biochemical analyses, we demonstrate that PRDX6 binds to GPX4 via a C47 disulfide bond, facilitating GPX4's membrane translocation and enhanced production of hydroxy fatty acids. Combining the inhibition of PRDX6 with ferroptosis inducers increases lipid peroxidation, effectively suppressing tumor growth in liver and ovarian cancer mouse models, including patient-derived models. Furthermore, high PRDX6 expression correlates with shorter progression-free survival across multiple human cancer types. Collectively, our findings delineate a PRDX6-dependent mechanism in ferroptosis defense, offering new perspectives for targeted cancer therapy.",induc lipid peroxidationdepend ferroptosi promis anticanc strategi howev develop resist pose consider challeng studi identifi peroxiredoxin 6 prdx6 crucial modul glutathion peroxidas 4 gpx4 affect local function role thu contribut ferroptosi resist prdx6 endow phospholipas a2 activ catalyz convers peroxyphospholipid lysophospholipid oxid fatti acid target structur mutat biochem analys demonstr prdx6 bind gpx4 via c47 disulfid bond facilit gpx4 membran transloc enhanc product hydroxi fatti acid combin inhibit prdx6 ferroptosi induc increas lipid peroxid effect suppress tumor growth liver ovarian cancer mous model includ patientderiv model furthermor high prdx6 express correl shorter progressionfre surviv across multipl human cancer type collect find delin prdx6depend mechan ferroptosi defens offer new perspect target cancer therapi
cancer,"Combining multiple biomarkers can considerably improve diagnostic accuracy compared to testing individually. Herein, we fabricated an AND logic gate biosensor responsive to stimuli based on a highly integrated DNAzyme sensing probe and the MnO(2) nanosheets nanocarrier to improve the sensitivity and specificity of cancer cell detection. Human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) and microRNA (miRNA) act as two ""input"" biomarkers to execute AND logic gate operation. Logical target recognition, signal transduction and amplification module are integrated into one allosteric DNAzyme probe by target-induced transformation from its locked conformation to active structure, which greatly facilitate the sensing progress. The MnO(2) nanosheets serve as the stimuli-responsive nanocarrier, which can only release the loaded sensing probes and cofactor Mn(2+) for DNAzyme cleavage after being decomposed by glutathione (GSH). Due to selective release and precise logic operation of the integrated DNAzyme probe, only target cancer cells can exhibit relatively strong fluorescence signal by the specific response of APE1 and miR-222. The proposed logic gate biosensor could not only perform accurate analysis of target cancer cells with high discrimination ratio from normal cells, but also enable visualized detection of miR-222 expression differences in different cancer cell types. This strategy will promote the development of simple and effective biosensors and provide a potential tool for cancer diagnosis and the related biomedical application.",combin multipl biomark consider improv diagnost accuraci compar test individu herein fabric logic gate biosensor respons stimuli base highli integr dnazym sens probe mno2 nanosheet nanocarri improv sensit specif cancer cell detect human apurinicapyrimidin endonucleas 1 ape1 microrna mirna act two input biomark execut logic gate oper logic target recognit signal transduct amplif modul integr one alloster dnazym probe targetinduc transform lock conform activ structur greatli facilit sens progress mno2 nanosheet serv stimulirespons nanocarri releas load sens probe cofactor mn2 dnazym cleavag decompos glutathion gsh due select releas precis logic oper integr dnazym probe target cancer cell exhibit rel strong fluoresc signal specif respons ape1 mir222 propos logic gate biosensor could perform accur analysi target cancer cell high discrimin ratio normal cell also enabl visual detect mir222 express differ differ cancer cell type strategi promot develop simpl effect biosensor provid potenti tool cancer diagnosi relat biomed applic

To now, several USP7 proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have been reported, and USP7 inhibitors used in USP7 PROTACs all feature tert-hydroxypiperidinol scaffold. In this study, we firstly designed and synthesized a panel of novel USP7 PROTACs with USP7 inhibitor containing thienopyridine, and identified D16 as a potent and selective USP7 degrader. Mechanistic investigation with specific inhibitors revealed that D16 induced USP7 degradation by binding to USP7 and E3 ligase CRBN. Proteomics analysis showed that D16 selectively decreased the expression of USP7 rather than other USPs. Moreover, treatment of D16 suppressed cell migration of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer cells with minor anti-proliferative activity. Our findings highlight that D16 may support as a promising lead compound for metastatic UGI cancer treatment.",usp7 report promot cancer progress remov ubiquitin variou substrat make target cancer therapi sever usp7 proteolysistarget chimera protac report usp7 inhibitor use usp7 protac featur terthydroxypiperidinol scaffold studi firstli design synthes panel novel usp7 protac usp7 inhibitor contain thienopyridin identifi d16 potent select usp7 degrad mechanist investig specif inhibitor reveal d16 induc usp7 degrad bind usp7 e3 ligas crbn proteom analysi show d16 select decreas express usp7 rather usp moreov treatment d16 suppress cell migrat upper gastrointestin ugi cancer cell minor antiprolif activ find highlight d16 may support promis lead compound metastat ugi cancer treatment

cancer,"The non-specificity of conventional chemotherapeutic agents often leads to severe adverse effects, posing a major challenge in oncology treatment. Peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) have emerged as a promising class of targeted therapeutics designed to overcome this limitation. A typical PDC comprises three key components: a tumor-homing peptide, a chemical linker, and a cytotoxic or therapeutic payload. This structure enables precise drug delivery to tumor sites, enhancing antitumor efficacy while minimizing damage to healthy tissues. In this review, we describe the structure and key constituents of PDCs, along with the functions of their individual components. Moreover, we summarize recent advances in the development of PDCs, with a focus on their target selection, design strategies, and anticancer applications. Notably, we also introduce emerging PROTAC-based PDCs, highlighting this innovative landscape in targeted protein degradation.

cancer,"Altered drug pharmacokinetics during inflammation or infection have been linked to elevated plasma concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines. Data on how these cytokines affect the expression and activity of intestinal drug transporters and, therefore, bioavailability of transported drugs, remain limited. Here, we used a novel human enteroid in vitro model to investigate the effects of key proinflammatory cytokines (ie, interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma) on the mRNA expression of major intestinal transporters and activity of intestinal breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Differentiated enteroid monolayers (in 96-well plates) were treated for 48 hours with each cytokine individually or in combination (cocktail) at 0.1, 1, or 10 ng/mL, encompassing their pathophysiological plasma concentrations in various inflammatory conditions. In a concentration-dependent manner, the cytokine cocktail significantly reduced the mRNA expression of BCRP, P-gp, multidrug resistance proteins 2/3, organic solute transporter alpha/beta, serotonin transporter, and organic anion transporter polypeptide 2B1, while increasing multidrug resistance protein4 mRNA expression. Among individual cytokines, IL-1beta elicited the most pronounced effects. To quantify the effect of cytokines on mRNA expression and activity of BCRP and P-gp, these treatments, at 1 ng/mL of individual cytokines or the cocktail, were repeated in the Transwell format. The efflux ratio of nitrofurantoin (a selective BCRP substrate), after exposure to 1 ng/mL of each cytokine or the cytokine cocktail for 48 hours, was significantly reduced, whereas the efflux ratio of digoxin (a P-gp substrate) remained unchanged. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Proinflammatory cytokines significantly downregulate major intestinal drug transporter expression and breast cancer resistance protein activity in human enteroid monolayers, highlighting the potential impact of inflammation on oral drug bioavailability. These results can be used to populate physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models to predict transporter-mediated drug absorption under inflammatory conditions, guiding safer and more effective dosing regimens.",alter drug pharmacokinet inflamm infect link elev plasma concentr proinflammatori cytokin data cytokin affect express activ intestin drug transport therefor bioavail transport drug remain limit use novel human enteroid vitro model investig effect key proinflammatori cytokin ie interleukin il1beta il6 tumor necrosi factoralpha interferongamma mrna express major intestin transport activ intestin breast cancer resist protein bcrp pglycoprotein pgp differenti enteroid monolay 96well plate treat 48 hour cytokin individu combin cocktail 01 1 10 ngml encompass pathophysiolog plasma concentr variou inflammatori condit concentrationdepend manner cytokin cocktail significantli reduc mrna express bcrp pgp multidrug resist protein 23 organ solut transport alphabeta serotonin transport organ anion transport polypeptid 2b1 increas multidrug resist protein4 mrna express among individu cytokin il1beta elicit pronounc effect quantifi effect cytokin mrna express activ bcrp pgp treatment 1 ngml individu cytokin cocktail repeat transwel format efflux ratio nitrofurantoin select bcrp substrat exposur 1 ngml cytokin cytokin cocktail 48 hour significantli reduc wherea efflux ratio digoxin pgp substrat remain unchang signific statement proinflammatori cytokin significantli downregul major intestin drug transport express breast cancer resist protein activ human enteroid monolay highlight potenti impact inflamm oral drug bioavail result use popul physiologicallybas pharmacokinet model predict transportermedi drug absorpt inflammatori condit guid safer effect dose regimen
cancer,"Epimedium Herba (EH) demonstrates significant therapeutic potential against prostate cancer (PC), though its mechanisms of action remain incompletely understood. This study investigates the pharmacological mechanisms of EH in treating PC through network pharmacology analysis and experimental validation. Active components and potential targets of EH were identified using network pharmacology from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). The STRING database facilitated the construction of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for shared targets and the identification of core anti-PC targets. Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein expression of core target genes in normal prostate and PC tissues, along with their correlation to overall PC survival, were analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed on the potential targets. Molecular docking of quercetin with key targets (TP53, TNF, heat shock protein 90 alpha family class A member 1 (HSP90AA1), AKT1, CASP3, and ESR1) was conducted, with results visualized using PyMOL. In vitro experiments validated the network pharmacology predictions. Twenty-three active ingredients of EH were identified, and the intersection of potential targets with PC targets yielded 183 potential targets. PPI network analysis revealed six key genes: targets (TP53), TNF, HSP90AA1, AKT1, CASP3, and ESR1. GO enrichment analysis identified 2369 biological processes (BP), 77 cellular components (CC), and 215 molecular functions (MF). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that EH's anti-cancer effects were mediated through interleukin-17 (IL-17), TNF, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT, apoptosis, p53, HIF-1, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance pathways. Core target validation confirmed consistency with the study's findings. Molecular docking indicated stable binding between the six core targets and quercetin. In vitro experiments confirmed quercetin's inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis in ACT-1 cells. This investigation identifies potential therapeutic targets for PC through network pharmacology and experimental validation.",epimedium herba eh demonstr signific therapeut potenti prostat cancer pc though mechan action remain incomplet understood studi investig pharmacolog mechan eh treat pc network pharmacolog analysi experiment valid activ compon potenti target eh identifi use network pharmacolog tradit chines medicin system pharmacolog databas analysi platform tcmsp string databas facilit construct proteinprotein interact ppi network share target identif core antipc target messeng ribonucl acid mrna protein express core target gene normal prostat pc tissu along correl overal pc surviv analyz use cancer genom atla tcga human protein atla hpa gene express profil interact analysi gepia databas gene ontolog go kyoto encyclopedia gene genom kegg pathway enrich analys perform potenti target molecular dock quercetin key target tp53 tnf heat shock protein 90 alpha famili class member 1 hsp90aa1 akt1 casp3 esr1 conduct result visual use pymol vitro experi valid network pharmacolog predict twentythre activ ingredi eh identifi intersect potenti target pc target yield 183 potenti target ppi network analysi reveal six key gene target tp53 tnf hsp90aa1 akt1 casp3 esr1 go enrich analysi identifi 2369 biolog process bp 77 cellular compon cc 215 molecular function mf kegg pathway enrich analysi demonstr eh anticanc effect mediat interleukin17 il17 tnf phosphatidylinositol 3kinas pi3kakt apoptosi p53 hif1 mitogenactiv protein kinas mapk nuclear factor kappab nfkappab egfr tyrosin kinas inhibitor resist pathway core target valid confirm consist studi find molecular dock indic stabl bind six core target quercetin vitro experi confirm quercetin inhibit prolifer induct apoptosi act1 cell investig identifi potenti therapeut target pc network pharmacolog experiment valid
cancer,"Radiotherapy remains a cornerstone in oncology, yet its efficacy is limited by tumor radioresistance and off-target toxicity. This review elucidates the transformative potential of hafnium (Hf)-based radiosensitizers in overcoming these challenges. Leveraging Hf's high atomic number, these Hf-based biomaterials enhance X-ray energy deposition through photoelectric and Auger effects, generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), and modulate immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments to enhance radiotherapy effect. Their distinctive capability to achieve multimodal synergy by integrating radiotherapy with photodynamic, chemotherapeutic, or immunotherapeutic strategies enables precise targeting and significantly enhances antitumor responses. Subsequently, this review rigorously assessed the current synthetic methodologies for Hf-based radiosensitizers, along with their capacities and limitations in terms of controlling material properties and ensuring scalability. Advanced imaging modalities such as fluorescence, CT, SPECT, MRI, and PA further establish Hf-based systems as theranostic platforms for real-time tumor localization and treatment monitoring. While clinical candidates like NBTXR3 exhibit promising trial outcomes, challenges remain in mechanistic clarification, biocompatibility optimization, and controlled in vivo degradation. Emerging AI-driven design and multidisciplinary integration hold promise to expedite clinical translation, advancing Hf-based radiosensitizers toward intelligent, personalized cancer therapy paradigms. This work highlights Hf's critical role in redefining precision radiotherapy and delineates a roadmap for next-generation oncological intervention.",radiotherapi remain cornerston oncolog yet efficaci limit tumor radioresist offtarget toxic review elucid transform potenti hafnium hfbase radiosensit overcom challeng leverag hf high atom number hfbase biomateri enhanc xray energi deposit photoelectr auger effect gener cytotox reactiv oxygen speci ro modul immunosuppress tumor microenviron enhanc radiotherapi effect distinct capabl achiev multimod synergi integr radiotherapi photodynam chemotherapeut immunotherapeut strategi enabl precis target significantli enhanc antitumor respons subsequ review rigor assess current synthet methodolog hfbase radiosensit along capac limit term control materi properti ensur scalabl advanc imag modal fluoresc ct spect mri pa establish hfbase system theranost platform realtim tumor local treatment monitor clinic candid like nbtxr3 exhibit promis trial outcom challeng remain mechanist clarif biocompat optim control vivo degrad emerg aidriven design multidisciplinari integr hold promis expedit clinic translat advanc hfbase radiosensit toward intellig person cancer therapi paradigm work highlight hf critic role redefin precis radiotherapi delin roadmap nextgener oncolog intervent
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Prostate diseases, including prostatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prostate cancer (PCa), are common in men and involve complex pathogenesis. Increasing evidence suggests that pathogen infections may influence prostate disease development through immune activation and chronic inflammation. However, causal relationships remain unclear. METHODS: We conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) and Bayesian weighted MR (BWMR) analyses to investigate the causal association between pathogen-specific antibody levels and prostate disease risk. Genetic data for pathogen antibodies were obtained from the UK Biobank, and GWAS summary statistics for prostatitis, BPH, and PCa were sourced from large public databases. Multiple sensitivity analyses were performed to validate the robustness of the findings. RESULTS: Positive levels of herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) mgG-1, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBNA-1, and human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) IE1B antibodies were associated with an increased risk of prostatitis, whereas EBV ZEBRA and HHV-7 U14 antibodies were protective. For PCa, HHV-6 E1A antibodies were risk factors, while HHV-7 IgG and Helicobacter pylori VacA antibodies exhibited protective effects. In BPH, EBV VCA p18, HSV-2 IgG, and Helicobacter pylori IgG antibodies increased risk, whereas Helicobacter pylori peroxidase, OMP, and EBV ZEBRA antibodies showed protective associations. No evidence of reverse causality was found. CONCLUSION: This study provides genetic evidence supporting a potential causal role of specific pathogen infections in the development of prostate diseases. Targeted prevention of certain infections may contribute to reducing prostate disease risk. Future studies are warranted to validate these findings across diverse populations and to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms.",background prostat diseas includ prostat benign prostat hyperplasia bph prostat cancer pca common men involv complex pathogenesi increas evid suggest pathogen infect may influenc prostat diseas develop immun activ chronic inflamm howev causal relationship remain unclear method conduct twosampl mendelian random mr bayesian weight mr bwmr analys investig causal associ pathogenspecif antibodi level prostat diseas risk genet data pathogen antibodi obtain uk biobank gwa summari statist prostat bph pca sourc larg public databas multipl sensit analys perform valid robust find result posit level herp simplex virus2 hsv2 mgg1 epsteinbarr viru ebv ebna1 human herpesvirus6 hhv6 ie1b antibodi associ increas risk prostat wherea ebv zebra hhv7 u14 antibodi protect pca hhv6 e1a antibodi risk factor hhv7 igg helicobact pylori vaca antibodi exhibit protect effect bph ebv vca p18 hsv2 igg helicobact pylori igg antibodi increas risk wherea helicobact pylori peroxidas omp ebv zebra antibodi show protect associ evid revers causal found conclus studi provid genet evid support potenti causal role specif pathogen infect develop prostat diseas target prevent certain infect may contribut reduc prostat diseas risk futur studi warrant valid find across divers popul elucid underli biolog mechan
cancer,"Ubiquitin-specific protease 10 (USP10) has emerged as a pivotal yet paradoxical regulator in breast cancer (BC) pathogenesis, exhibiting context-dependent duality as both an oncogenic driver and tumor suppressor. This review synthesizes recent advances in elucidating USP10's mechanistic roles in modulating oncogenic signaling, tumor immunity, and therapeutic resistance, with a central focus on its paradoxical dual regulation. USP10 stabilizes tumor-promoting substrates to drive the malignant phenotypes, while also exerting tumor-suppressive effects. Clinically, USP10 overexpression correlates with aggressive phenotypes and poor prognosis. Therapeutically, USP10 inhibition synergizes with Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), effectively suppressing tumor growth in preclinical models. Key challenges include resolving USP10's functional dichotomy across BC subtypes, developing isoform-selective inhibitors, and overcoming resistance mechanisms. Future directions emphasize spatial proteomics to map USP10 interactomes in metastatic niches and genetically engineered models for validating synthetic lethality approaches. Collectively, USP10 represents a promising therapeutic target in BC. Its complex, context-dependent role underscores the need for targeted strategies to exploit its functions for precision oncology.",ubiquitinspecif proteas 10 usp10 emerg pivot yet paradox regul breast cancer bc pathogenesi exhibit contextdepend dualiti oncogen driver tumor suppressor review synthes recent advanc elucid usp10 mechanist role modul oncogen signal tumor immun therapeut resist central focu paradox dual regul usp10 stabil tumorpromot substrat drive malign phenotyp also exert tumorsuppress effect clinic usp10 overexpress correl aggress phenotyp poor prognosi therapeut usp10 inhibit synerg poli adpribos polymeras parp inhibitor antibodydrug conjug adc effect suppress tumor growth preclin model key challeng includ resolv usp10 function dichotomi across bc subtyp develop isoformselect inhibitor overcom resist mechan futur direct emphas spatial proteom map usp10 interactom metastat nich genet engin model valid synthet lethal approach collect usp10 repres promis therapeut target bc complex contextdepend role underscor need target strategi exploit function precis oncolog
cancer,"Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective anticancer therapeutic but exhibits dose-dependent, potentially life-threatening cardiotoxicity. The specific mechanisms driving this cardiotoxicity are not fully understood but can include the induction of oxidative stress and subsequent cell death mechanism activation. This has prompted the exploration of NRF2, a master co-ordinator of antioxidant and largely cytoprotective pathways, as a potential approach for the alleviation of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Here, NRF2 was pharmacologically activated via CDDO-Me (hitherto referred to as CDDO) to reduce the negative consequences on AC16 human cardiomyocyte cell health and functions. NRF2 intracellular dynamics were quantitatively measured using live-cell imaging, demonstrating rapid ( approximately 10 min) yet sustained (>/=24 h) induction of NRF2 expression and functional downstream activity. Genetic perturbations of the NRF2-KEAP1 system highlight that CDDO acts specifically through NRF2 to exert AC16 cytoprotection from DOX whilst not promoting human lung and pancreatic cancer cell line viability.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Salvage surgery is one of the treatment options for recurrent metastatic head and neck cancer (RMHNC). Salvage surgery with reconstruction for patients with a history of reconstructive surgery and radiation therapy (RT) is especially difficult and carries a high risk of complications. METHODS: This study included patients with RMHNC who had a history of reconstructive surgery and RT. The prognosis and complications were evaluated by dividing patients into those who underwent salvage surgery with reconstruction and those who underwent non-surgical treatments. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were enrolled. The overall survival (OS) of the salvage surgery with reconstruction group was better than that of the non-surgical treatment groups (median OS; 50.6 months vs. 21.6 months, p = 0.0373), but the progression-free survival (PFS) was similar (median PFS; 14.5 months vs. 12.9 months, p = 0.48). The salvage surgery with reconstruction group also showed a better prognosis than the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) group (median OS; 50.6 months vs. 30.9 months, p = 0.209). In the salvage surgery with reconstruction group, 85.8 % of cases experienced postoperative complications, while in the patients who underwent non-surgical treatments, 58.8 % experienced adverse events (p = 0.0724). There were no cases of Grade IIIb or higher that required general anesthesia. CONCLUSION: Salvage surgery with reconstruction showed a better prognosis than other non-surgical treatments, including ICI. Furthermore, with careful case selection and thorough postoperative care, salvage surgery with reconstruction can be performed relatively safely without any serious complications.",background salvag surgeri one treatment option recurr metastat head neck cancer rmhnc salvag surgeri reconstruct patient histori reconstruct surgeri radiat therapi rt especi difficult carri high risk complic method studi includ patient rmhnc histori reconstruct surgeri rt prognosi complic evalu divid patient underw salvag surgeri reconstruct underw nonsurg treatment result fiftyseven patient enrol overal surviv os salvag surgeri reconstruct group better nonsurg treatment group median os 506 month vs 216 month p 00373 progressionfre surviv pf similar median pf 145 month vs 129 month p 048 salvag surgeri reconstruct group also show better prognosi immun checkpoint inhibitor ici group median os 506 month vs 309 month p 0209 salvag surgeri reconstruct group 858 case experienc postop complic patient underw nonsurg treatment 588 experienc advers event p 00724 case grade iiib higher requir gener anesthesia conclus salvag surgeri reconstruct show better prognosi nonsurg treatment includ ici furthermor care case select thorough postop care salvag surgeri reconstruct perform rel safe without seriou complic
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Disruption of circadian and neuroimmune regulation after rectal cancer surgery contributes to psychological distress, inflammation, and impaired recovery. This exploratory randomized controlled trial evaluated whether a perioperative multicomponent behavioral program targeting circadian and gut-brain processes was associated with improvements in neuroimmune profiles and symptom outcomes. METHODS: A total of 184 patients with stage I-III low rectal cancer undergoing ultra-low anterior resection were randomized to receive either standard ERAS care or an integrative perioperative intervention that combined emotion-regulation strategies (mindfulness-based stress reduction, heart-rate-variability biofeedback, neurofeedback) with structured sleep and circadian therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, controlled-release melatonin, circadian scheduling). Co-primary outcomes were depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-II) and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha), gastrointestinal recovery indices, and skeletal muscle index (SMI). Disease-free and overall survival were examined as pre-specified exploratory endpoints. RESULTS: Compared with standard care, the integrative intervention was associated with greater 6-month improvements in depressive symptoms and sleep quality (both p < 0.01), lower postoperative inflammation (e.g., POD7 interleukin-6: 39.7 vs 52.3 pg/mL; p < 0.001), and faster gastrointestinal recovery. Preservation of SMI at 12 months was associated with improved disease-free survival (hazard ratio 0.51, 95 % CI 0.29-0.92; p = 0.027). Two-year disease-free survival showed an exploratory signal favoring the intervention (89.7 % vs 74.0 %; hazard ratio 0.46, 95 % CI 0.23-0.93), although survival analyses were not powered for definitive inference. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative modulation of circadian and gut-brain processes was associated with improvements in depressive symptoms, sleep quality, postoperative inflammatory profiles, and functional recovery. Survival findings represent preliminary exploratory signals and require confirmation in larger, adequately powered randomized trials.",background disrupt circadian neuroimmun regul rectal cancer surgeri contribut psycholog distress inflamm impair recoveri exploratori random control trial evalu whether periop multicompon behavior program target circadian gutbrain process associ improv neuroimmun profil symptom outcom method total 184 patient stage iiii low rectal cancer undergo ultralow anterior resect random receiv either standard era care integr periop intervent combin emotionregul strategi mindfulnessbas stress reduct heartratevari biofeedback neurofeedback structur sleep circadian therapi cognit behavior therapi insomnia controlledreleas melatonin circadian schedul coprimari outcom depress symptom beck depress inventoryii sleep qualiti pittsburgh sleep qualiti index 6 month secondari outcom includ inflammatori marker creactiv protein interleukin6 tumor necrosi factoralpha gastrointestin recoveri indic skelet muscl index smi diseasefre overal surviv examin prespecifi exploratori endpoint result compar standard care integr intervent associ greater 6month improv depress symptom sleep qualiti p 001 lower postop inflamm eg pod7 interleukin6 397 vs 523 pgml p 0001 faster gastrointestin recoveri preserv smi 12 month associ improv diseasefre surviv hazard ratio 051 95 ci 029092 p 0027 twoyear diseasefre surviv show exploratori signal favor intervent 897 vs 740 hazard ratio 046 95 ci 023093 although surviv analys power definit infer conclus periop modul circadian gutbrain process associ improv depress symptom sleep qualiti postop inflammatori profil function recoveri surviv find repres preliminari exploratori signal requir confirm larger adequ power random trial
cancer,"The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase Stimulator of Interferon Genes (cGAS-STING) pathway is a key component of innate immunity, detecting cytosolic DNA and initiating type I interferon (IFN-I) responses that shape downstream adaptive immunity. Owing to its central role in antiviral defense, tumor immunosurveillance, and inflammatory regulation, STING has emerged as a promising therapeutic target across oncology, infectious diseases, neuroinflammation, and autoimmune disorders. However, the clinical translation of STING agonists and antagonists is constrained by poor pharmacokinetics, rapid systemic clearance, off-target cytokine release, and inefficient cytosolic delivery. To address these barriers, a diverse set of delivery technologies including lipid nanoparticles, polymeric carriers, inorganic nanomaterials, hydrogels, biologically derived vectors, and antibody STING conjugates has been developed to improve selective uptake, endosomal escape, pHarmacological stability, and tissue-specific accumulation. This review systematically examines these platforms, highlighting their mechanisms, immunological effects, advantages, limitations, and stages of clinical progression. Emerging innovations such as stimuli-responsive delivery systems, mRNA encoded STING modulators, virus-like particle (VLP) technologies, carrier-free nanocomplexes, and cell-based delivery approaches are also discussed for their potential to enable precise, tunable, and context-specific modulation of the cGAS-STING axis. Collectively, these advances represent a significant evolution in STING-targeted therapy, providing new opportunities to harness innate immunity and expand therapeutic applications across a broad spectrum of disease settings.",cyclic gmpamp synthas stimul interferon gene cgasst pathway key compon innat immun detect cytosol dna initi type interferon ifni respons shape downstream adapt immun owe central role antivir defens tumor immunosurveil inflammatori regul sting emerg promis therapeut target across oncolog infecti diseas neuroinflamm autoimmun disord howev clinic translat sting agonist antagonist constrain poor pharmacokinet rapid system clearanc offtarget cytokin releas ineffici cytosol deliveri address barrier divers set deliveri technolog includ lipid nanoparticl polymer carrier inorgan nanomateri hydrogel biolog deriv vector antibodi sting conjug develop improv select uptak endosom escap pharmacolog stabil tissuespecif accumul review systemat examin platform highlight mechan immunolog effect advantag limit stage clinic progress emerg innov stimulirespons deliveri system mrna encod sting modul viruslik particl vlp technolog carrierfre nanocomplex cellbas deliveri approach also discuss potenti enabl precis tunabl contextspecif modul cgasst axi collect advanc repres signific evolut stingtarget therapi provid new opportun har innat immun expand therapeut applic across broad spectrum diseas set
cancer,"BACKGROUND: T cell exhaustion (Tex) induced by chronic antigen exposure critically limits cancer immunotherapy. Mechanistic understanding remains incomplete, largely due to inefficient, costly in vivo models and a lack of effective interventions. Improved in vitro models are therefore urgently needed for mechanism discovery and drug screening. METHODS: An optimized in vitro T cell exhaustion model was established via chronic anti-CD3 antibody stimulation, achieving robust reproducibility, high cell yields ( approximately 10(8)), and suitability for high-throughput analyses. Exhaustion was validated functionally and by proteomic profiling across multiple timepoints. Rho family-interacting cell polarization regulator 2 (RIPOR2) was identified as a key regulator and functionally verified through siRNA knockdown assays. Molecular docking screened Ginsenoside F3 (GF3) targeting RIPOR2, and GF3 was tested both in vitro and in a mouse NSCLC model with anti-PD-1 therapy. RESULTS: Our model accurately recapitulated clinical exhaustion phenotypes, notably reproducing diminished cytotoxicity ( approximately 60% reduction compared to controls). Proteomics dynamically revealed significant protein alterations during exhaustion, including a  approximately 14-fold downregulation of RIPOR2 mRNA in exhausted T cells. RIPOR2 depletion further exacerbated exhaustion (e.g.,Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion reduced  approximately 30%, Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) increased  approximately 20%). GF3 robustly bound RIPOR2, significantly reversed exhaustion phenotypes (reducing PD-1(+)TIM-3(+)(Hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2) cells by  approximately 40%), and restored cytokine production. In vivo, GF3 enhanced CD8(+)T cell infiltration, synergized with anti-PD-1 therapy, and significantly reduced tumor burden ( approximately 40% decrease). CONCLUSION: RIPOR2 is identified as a critical immunometabolic regulator of T cell exhaustion. GF3-mediated RIPOR2 restoration effectively reverses exhaustion, presenting a novel immunotherapeutic strategy. Our optimized in vitro model provides an efficient platform for future mechanistic and pharmacological research.",background cell exhaust tex induc chronic antigen exposur critic limit cancer immunotherapi mechanist understand remain incomplet larg due ineffici costli vivo model lack effect intervent improv vitro model therefor urgent need mechan discoveri drug screen method optim vitro cell exhaust model establish via chronic anticd3 antibodi stimul achiev robust reproduc high cell yield approxim 108 suitabl highthroughput analys exhaust valid function proteom profil across multipl timepoint rho familyinteract cell polar regul 2 ripor2 identifi key regul function verifi sirna knockdown assay molecular dock screen ginsenosid f3 gf3 target ripor2 gf3 test vitro mous nsclc model antipd1 therapi result model accur recapitul clinic exhaust phenotyp notabl reproduc diminish cytotox approxim 60 reduct compar control proteom dynam reveal signific protein alter exhaust includ approxim 14fold downregul ripor2 mrna exhaust cell ripor2 deplet exacerb exhaust eginterferongamma ifngamma secret reduc approxim 30 program cell death protein 1 pd1 increas approxim 20 gf3 robustli bound ripor2 significantli revers exhaust phenotyp reduc pd1tim3hepat viru cellular receptor 2 cell approxim 40 restor cytokin product vivo gf3 enhanc cd8t cell infiltr synerg antipd1 therapi significantli reduc tumor burden approxim 40 decreas conclus ripor2 identifi critic immunometabol regul cell exhaust gf3mediat ripor2 restor effect revers exhaust present novel immunotherapeut strategi optim vitro model provid effici platform futur mechanist pharmacolog research
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the world, and a high-fat diet is associated with the development of digestive cancers. Traditional Chinese medicine is a treasure trove of natural products (NPs) with anticancer effects. OBJECTIVES: We provide a comprehensive overview of NPs that can target high-fat diet-associated digestive cancers (HFDDC) and to investigate their mechanisms of action for drug discovery. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the EU Clinical Trials Register, using keywords including NPs, high-fat diet, digestive cancers, and specific NP names. RESULTS: NPs exert multi-targeting effects against HFDDC. This study systematically investigated their multi-targeting therapeutic mechanisms. Mechanistically, NPs (e.g., curcumin and berberine) can inhibit the transformation from inflammation to cancer by targeting STAT3 and WNT pathways. Several NPs (e.g., glycyrrhizic acid and mulberry leaf extract) activate SREBP and PKCalpha/Rac1 pathways regulating lipid metabolism to alleviate the accumulation of abnormal lipids in the cell, and reduce the growth of cancer cell. By modulating NRF2 and COX-2 pathways, rosmarinic acid and lycopene exert anti-oxidative stress. NPs such as salicylic acid and genkwanin consolidate the body's immune surveillance defense, and restore the human immunity and prevent the escape of cancer cells. Moreover, garo-oligosaccharides and prebiotics combat HFDDC through the restoration of the gut flora homeostasis. Existing clinical trials have shown that several NPs (e.g., berberine, curcumin, lycopene and fish oil) exert both anticancer and lipid-modulating effects. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate the great potential of NPs in preventing and treating HFDDC through multi-target mechanisms, laying the foundation for their clinical translation.",background cancer second lead caus death world highfat diet associ develop digest cancer tradit chines medicin treasur trove natur product np anticanc effect object provid comprehens overview np target highfat dietassoci digest cancer hfddc investig mechan action drug discoveri materi method systemat literatur search conduct pubm web scienc clinicaltrialsgov eu clinic trial regist use keyword includ np highfat diet digest cancer specif np name result np exert multitarget effect hfddc studi systemat investig multitarget therapeut mechan mechanist np eg curcumin berberin inhibit transform inflamm cancer target stat3 wnt pathway sever np eg glycyrrhiz acid mulberri leaf extract activ srebp pkcalpharac1 pathway regul lipid metabol allevi accumul abnorm lipid cell reduc growth cancer cell modul nrf2 cox2 pathway rosmarin acid lycopen exert antioxid stress np salicyl acid genkwanin consolid bodi immun surveil defens restor human immun prevent escap cancer cell moreov garooligosaccharid prebiot combat hfddc restor gut flora homeostasi exist clinic trial shown sever np eg berberin curcumin lycopen fish oil exert anticanc lipidmodul effect conclus find demonstr great potenti np prevent treat hfddc multitarget mechan lay foundat clinic translat
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps are the gold standard for autologous breast reconstructions, but alternatives are needed when the abdomen is not optional. The superior gluteal artery perforator (SGAP) flap, using the gluteal region as donor site, is such an alternative. However, SGAP-flaps are not widely used for breast reconstructions due to technical and anatomical challenges, and potential donor site deformity. This study presents a slightly modified SGAP-flap harvesting technique for breast reconstructions aimed at optimizing outcomes and describes surgical and patient-reported outcomes. METHODS: An observational study (retrospective and cross-sectional) was conducted by including all women who underwent SGAP-flap breast reconstruction between May 2012 and March 2024 in a high-volume cancer center. Patient and surgical characteristics, (un)planned surgical revision rates, and patient-reported satisfaction were assessed using BREAST-Q (91% response rate). RESULTS: In total, 33 SGAP-flap breast reconstructions were performed in 26 patients. Mean ischemia time was 156 min. Four major complications (12%) requiring unplanned surgical intervention occurred, with no (partial) flap loss (i.e., 100% flap survival). Four flaps underwent planned secondary corrections (12%) of the donor site. Patient-reported donor site deformity and/or dissatisfaction was infrequent (n=2). Five patients underwent SGAP-flap on one side and DIEP-flap reconstruction contralaterally (15%), with similarly high patient-reported satisfaction and well-being scores for both sides. CONCLUSIONS: High patient-reported satisfaction, and low complication and donor site deformity rates were observed in patients undergoing autologous breast reconstruction using a slightly refined SGAP-flap technique. This technique may be considered as an acceptable alternative for DIEP-flap breast reconstructions.",background deep inferior epigastr perfor diep flap gold standard autolog breast reconstruct altern need abdomen option superior gluteal arteri perfor sgap flap use gluteal region donor site altern howev sgapflap wide use breast reconstruct due technic anatom challeng potenti donor site deform studi present slightli modifi sgapflap harvest techniqu breast reconstruct aim optim outcom describ surgic patientreport outcom method observ studi retrospect crosssect conduct includ women underw sgapflap breast reconstruct may 2012 march 2024 highvolum cancer center patient surgic characterist unplan surgic revis rate patientreport satisfact assess use breastq 91 respons rate result total 33 sgapflap breast reconstruct perform 26 patient mean ischemia time 156 min four major complic 12 requir unplan surgic intervent occur partial flap loss ie 100 flap surviv four flap underw plan secondari correct 12 donor site patientreport donor site deform andor dissatisfact infrequ n2 five patient underw sgapflap one side diepflap reconstruct contralater 15 similarli high patientreport satisfact wellb score side conclus high patientreport satisfact low complic donor site deform rate observ patient undergo autolog breast reconstruct use slightli refin sgapflap techniqu techniqu may consid accept altern diepflap breast reconstruct
cancer,"A new series of 2-(methylthio)-7H-[1,3,4]thiadiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidin-7-one derivatives was synthesized and evaluated for in vitro anticancer activity against six human cancer cell lines; laryngeal carcinoma (Hep2), human prostate cancer (PC3), cervical carcinoma (Hela), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG-2), human colon cancer (HCT-116), and mammary gland breast cancer (MCF-7). The most active compounds against the selected cancer cell lines, 3, 4, 6a and 6b were further screened for in vitro cytotoxicity against lung fibroblast (WI38) normal cells. The results revealed that they exhibited high SI values toward Hela and HepG-2 cancer cells. Analysis of cell cycle manifested that compound 3 induced cell cycle arrest in Hela and HepG-2 at G0-G1 phase causing cell death principally via apoptosis. Apoptosis induction by compound 3 was confirmed through elevated levels of caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in the screened cancer cells. Moreover, the same compounds were further evaluated for inhibitory activity against EGFR-TK(WT) and topoisomerase IIalpha. The obtained results revealed that compound 6a displayed strong inhibitory activity against EGFR-TK(WT) (IC(50) = 0.078 muM) that closely approximates the reference drug erlotinib and promising inhibitory activity against topoisomerase IIalpha (IC(50) = 12.6 muM) surpassing that of etoposide. Compound 6a dual inhibitory activity on the expression of EGFR-TK(WT) and topo IIalpha in HepG-2 cells was further evidenced through Western blot analysis. Furthermore, compound 3 demonstrated good inhibitory activity against EGFR-TK(WT) (IC(50) = 0.122 muM) compared to erlotinib and superior inhibitory activity against topoisomerase IIalpha (IC(50) = 16.8 muM) compared to etoposide. Additionally, compound 6a was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against EGFR(L858R) and EGFR(T790M) mutants, and it displayed promising activity against EGFR(T790M) and moderate activity against EGFR(L858R) (IC(50) = 0.088 and 0.189 muM, respectively) compared to erlotinib. Moreover, human epidermoid carcinoma (A431) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (H1975) cells were utilized to assess the in vitro cytotoxicity of compound 6a and it showed good activity over A431 and H1975 cells (IC(50) = 7.89 and 13.11 muM, respectively) compared to erlotinib. Molecular docking studies of 3 and 6a confirmed the high binding affinity of both compounds toward the active site of EGFR-TK(WT) and topoisomerase IIalpha. Finally, compound 6a was proved to adopt the exact fit into the active site of a double mutant EGFR(T790M/L858R). Molecular dynamics simulations of compound 6a were performed, and the results confirmed the stable binding interactions toward EGFR-TK(WT) and topoisomerase IIalpha active sites, supporting the consistency of the docking results.",new seri 2methylthio7h134thiadiazolo32apyrimidin7on deriv synthes evalu vitro anticanc activ six human cancer cell line laryng carcinoma hep2 human prostat cancer pc3 cervic carcinoma hela hepatocellular carcinoma hepg2 human colon cancer hct116 mammari gland breast cancer mcf7 activ compound select cancer cell line 3 4 6a 6b screen vitro cytotox lung fibroblast wi38 normal cell result reveal exhibit high si valu toward hela hepg2 cancer cell analysi cell cycl manifest compound 3 induc cell cycl arrest hela hepg2 g0g1 phase caus cell death princip via apoptosi apoptosi induct compound 3 confirm elev level caspase3 baxbcl2 ratio screen cancer cell moreov compound evalu inhibitori activ egfrtkwt topoisomeras iialpha obtain result reveal compound 6a display strong inhibitori activ egfrtkwt ic50 0078 mum close approxim refer drug erlotinib promis inhibitori activ topoisomeras iialpha ic50 126 mum surpass etoposid compound 6a dual inhibitori activ express egfrtkwt topo iialpha hepg2 cell evidenc western blot analysi furthermor compound 3 demonstr good inhibitori activ egfrtkwt ic50 0122 mum compar erlotinib superior inhibitori activ topoisomeras iialpha ic50 168 mum compar etoposid addit compound 6a evalu inhibitori activ egfrl858r egfrt790m mutant display promis activ egfrt790m moder activ egfrl858r ic50 0088 0189 mum respect compar erlotinib moreov human epidermoid carcinoma a431 nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc h1975 cell util assess vitro cytotox compound 6a show good activ a431 h1975 cell ic50 789 1311 mum respect compar erlotinib molecular dock studi 3 6a confirm high bind affin compound toward activ site egfrtkwt topoisomeras iialpha final compound 6a prove adopt exact fit activ site doubl mutant egfrt790ml858r molecular dynam simul compound 6a perform result confirm stabl bind interact toward egfrtkwt topoisomeras iialpha activ site support consist dock result
cancer,"Triple negative breast cancer remains one of the most aggressive malignancies with limited targeted therapies and poor survival outcomes. Although DNA-intercalating agents, including natural products exhibit anti-cancer potential by disrupting various cellular processes that rely on DNA-protein interactions, their therapeutic application is limited by poor tumor selectivity and high cytotoxicity to normal cells. Here, through rational design, synthesis and optimization, we have developed a series of novel Quinoline-1(3H)-one derivatives aimed at enhancing selectivity towards TNBC. While several synthesized molecules demonstrated promising anticancer activity across multiple cancer cell lines, compound 4l emerged as the most potent and selective DNA-binding agent, exhibiting low IC(50) values in TNBC (IC(50) = 2.08 +/- 0.67 muM) with minimal cytotoxicity to WI-38 (CC(50) = >/=60 muM) a normal lung fibroblasts cell. Importantly, comparative analyses revealed substantially higher selectivity index of compound 4l than the clinical DNA-binding drug doxorubicin. Further in vitro, studies demonstrated that Compound 4l induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and robust, caspase-3 dependent apoptosis. This response was driven by marked intracellular and mitochondrial ROS generation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and non-intercalative electrostatic DNA binding. Collectively, these results highlight compound 4l as a promising, selective anticancer candidate with improved therapeutic potential for TNBC.",tripl neg breast cancer remain one aggress malign limit target therapi poor surviv outcom although dnaintercal agent includ natur product exhibit anticanc potenti disrupt variou cellular process reli dnaprotein interact therapeut applic limit poor tumor select high cytotox normal cell ration design synthesi optim develop seri novel quinoline13hon deriv aim enhanc select toward tnbc sever synthes molecul demonstr promis anticanc activ across multipl cancer cell line compound 4l emerg potent select dnabind agent exhibit low ic50 valu tnbc ic50 208 067 mum minim cytotox wi38 cc50 60 mum normal lung fibroblast cell importantli compar analys reveal substanti higher select index compound 4l clinic dnabind drug doxorubicin vitro studi demonstr compound 4l induc g2m cell cycl arrest robust caspase3 depend apoptosi respons driven mark intracellular mitochondri ro gener loss mitochondri membran potenti noninterc electrostat dna bind collect result highlight compound 4l promis select anticanc candid improv therapeut potenti tnbc
cancer,"CDK2 has a pivotal role in the cell cycle process, and regulates a broad range of important biological processes, and recent investigations have revealed that inhibiting CDK2 can reverse cancer resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors, indicating the therapeutic promise of CDK2 as an attractive therapeutic target in cancer treatment. Herein, we discovered a novel class of cycloalkyl-fused thiazole-substituted 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivatives as potent CDK2 inhibitors. Especially, compound 12c significantly inhibited CDK2 (IC(50) = 4.7 nM) which was 7-fold greater than positive control AZD5438, and exhibited remarkable antiproliferative efficacy toward HCT-116, A549, HeLa, and MCF-7 cells with the IC(50)s of 1.29-6.14 muM. Mechanism research revealed that 12c dose-dependently caused G(2)/M cell cycle arrest, and promoted apoptosis of HCT116.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with poor 5-year survival <15 %. We aimed to investigate the association between T and N stages of stage IV CRC and survival. METHODS: A retrospective population-based cohort analysis of patients who underwent surgery for stage IV colorectal adenocarcinomas from the SEER database (2010-2020) was conducted. T and N stages of the primary CRC were examined as independent predictors for cancer-specific survival (CSS) against other factors in a multivariable Cox regression analysis. the main outcome measure was 5-year CSS. Kaplan-Meier statistics were used to show differences in CSS among the groups. RESULTS: 73,427 patients (52.4 % male; mean age: 64.9 years) were included. 5-year CSS was 20.7 % (95 %CI:20.4-21 %). 5-year CSS rate significantly decreased with increased T stage (T1 and T2 = 33.3 %, T3 = 22.1 %, T4 = 17.4) and with nodal disease (N0 = 31.2 %, N1 = 23.6 %, N2 = 14.5 %). T4 tumors (HR:1.33, 95 %CI:1.05, 1.68; p = 0.017) and N1 and N2 disease (HR:1.27 and 1.59, respectively; p < 0.001) were independently associated with reduced CSS. Other independent predictors were increased age (HR:1.02; p < 0.001), male sex (HR:1.07; p = 0.005), Black race (HR:1.19; p < 0.001), signet-ring cell histology (HR:1.44; p < 0.001), poorly differentiated (HR:1.58; p < 0.001) and undifferentiated (HR:1.76; p < 0.001) carcinomas, perineural invasion (HR:1.23; p < 0.001), tumor deposits (HR:1.03; p < 0.001), elevated CEA levels (HR:1.96; p < 0.001), and multiple organ metastases (HR:1.82; p < 0.001). CSS improved with distant metastases resection (HR:0.86; p < 0.001) and systemic therapy (neoadjuvant: HR = 0.51, adjuvant: HR = 0.48, combined: HR = 0.40; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Advanced T and N stages of stage IV CRC were associated with worse CSS. Older, male, and Black patients with high-grade, mucinous, and signet-ring cell carcinomas, perineural invasion, tumor deposits, and elevated CEA levels had worse CSS.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Major pathological response (MPR) has emerged as a key surrogate endpoint for evaluating the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, its predictive value for long-term survival and its role in guiding individualized adjuvant therapy (AT) decisions require further validation in real-world populations. METHODS: This study is a multicenter retrospective cohort study, which included 373 NSCLC patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) or neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy (NICT) followed by radical surgery between January 2015 and December 2022. The primary endpoints were the cumulative incidence of death (CID) and the cumulative incidence of recurrence (CIR). Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: The overall MPR rate was 38.3 % (143/373). Multivariate analysis confirmed MPR as an independent protective predictor for both CID (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.41, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.23-0.72, P = 0.002) and CIR (HR = 0.32, 95 % CI: 0.2-0.61, P < 0.001). Patients with MPR showed significantly better 5-year CID (14.6 % vs. 44.7 %) and CIR (16.4 % vs. 54.7 %) (both P < 0.001). The core finding of this study is that the survival benefit of AT depends on the interaction between the neoadjuvant treatment modality and MPR status: In patients who did not achieve MPR after NCT, AT significantly reduced 5-year CID (44.7 % vs. 74.6 %, P = 0.008); however, in all patients after NICT, regardless of MPR status, AT did not show significant survival benefit. CONCLUSION: MPR is a robust predictor of long-term survival after neoadjuvant therapy for NSCLC. AT decisions should be based on a binary ""treatment modality-pathological response"" framework: non-MPR patients after NCT are clear candidates for intensive AT, whereas patients after NICT may not routinely require AT, regardless of MPR status.",background major patholog respons mpr emerg key surrog endpoint evalu efficaci neoadjuv therapi nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc howev predict valu longterm surviv role guid individu adjuv therapi decis requir valid realworld popul method studi multicent retrospect cohort studi includ 373 nsclc patient underw neoadjuv chemotherapi nct neoadjuv immunotherapi combin chemotherapi nict follow radic surgeri januari 2015 decemb 2022 primari endpoint cumul incid death cid cumul incid recurr cir surviv analysi perform use kaplanmei method logrank test cox proport hazard model result overal mpr rate 383 143373 multivari analysi confirm mpr independ protect predictor cid hazard ratio hr 041 95 confid interv ci 023072 p 0002 cir hr 032 95 ci 02061 p 0001 patient mpr show significantli better 5year cid 146 vs 447 cir 164 vs 547 p 0001 core find studi surviv benefit depend interact neoadjuv treatment modal mpr statu patient achiev mpr nct significantli reduc 5year cid 447 vs 746 p 0008 howev patient nict regardless mpr statu show signific surviv benefit conclus mpr robust predictor longterm surviv neoadjuv therapi nsclc decis base binari treatment modalitypatholog respons framework nonmpr patient nct clear candid intens wherea patient nict may routin requir regardless mpr statu
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Head and neck cancers (HNC) are common globally with high rates of locoregional recurrence. The detection and enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are emerging prognostic biomarkers in solid tumors. This study aimed to detect CTCs in HNC patients, particularly head and neck mucosal squamous cell carcinoma (HNmSCC), and evaluate its prognostic value for predicting relapse. METHOD: HNC patients undergoing surgical resection were prospectively recruited. Peripheral blood samples were collected preoperatively and postoperatively, then analysed for CTCs using the AccuCyte-CyteFinder platform. Prognostic performance was assessed using multivariate logistic regressions, ROC analysis and recurrence-free survival. RESULTS: Among 106 recruited patients, 79 had available preoperative blood samples and epithelial malignancies, with 57 (72 %) classified as HNmSCC. CTCs were detected in 81 % (46/57) of HNmSCC patients with a mean of 19 CTCs per 7.5 mL of blood (median = 9). Using a cutoff of >/=5 CTCs in a preoperative blood sample, CTC-high status was significantly associated with relapse (odds ratio = 9.52, p = 0.022) and a worse recurrence-free survival (p = 0.016). In multivariable analysis, CTC-high status remained independently significant after adjusting for other clinicopathologic parameters with consistent effect sizes across models (adjusted odds ratio = 8-10). Notably, both CTCs and margin involvement remained independently significant (margins: adjusted odds ratio = 6.17, p = 0.024) demonstrating complementary prognostic value. In exploratory postoperative follow-up samples (N = 36), CTC-high status was significantly associated with relapse (odds ratio = 26.71, p = 0.0009). CONCLUSION: CTCs detected using the AccuCyte-CyteFinder platform demonstrate independent prognostic value in HNmSCC patients, complementing conventional pathologic assessment, particularly margin involvement. This proof-of-concept study provides preliminary evidence that preoperative CTC enumeration could enhance risk stratification to identify patients at high risk of relapse, potentially enabling more personalised surveillance and treatments.",background head neck cancer hnc common global high rate locoregion recurr detect enumer circul tumor cell ctc emerg prognost biomark solid tumor studi aim detect ctc hnc patient particularli head neck mucos squamou cell carcinoma hnmscc evalu prognost valu predict relaps method hnc patient undergo surgic resect prospect recruit peripher blood sampl collect preoper postop analys ctc use accucytecytefind platform prognost perform assess use multivari logist regress roc analysi recurrencefre surviv result among 106 recruit patient 79 avail preoper blood sampl epitheli malign 57 72 classifi hnmscc ctc detect 81 4657 hnmscc patient mean 19 ctc per 75 ml blood median 9 use cutoff 5 ctc preoper blood sampl ctchigh statu significantli associ relaps odd ratio 952 p 0022 wors recurrencefre surviv p 0016 multivari analysi ctchigh statu remain independ signific adjust clinicopatholog paramet consist effect size across model adjust odd ratio 810 notabl ctc margin involv remain independ signific margin adjust odd ratio 617 p 0024 demonstr complementari prognost valu exploratori postop followup sampl n 36 ctchigh statu significantli associ relaps odd ratio 2671 p 00009 conclus ctc detect use accucytecytefind platform demonstr independ prognost valu hnmscc patient complement convent patholog assess particularli margin involv proofofconcept studi provid preliminari evid preoper ctc enumer could enhanc risk stratif identifi patient high risk relaps potenti enabl personalis surveil treatment
cancer,"BACKGROUND: leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors subfamily B member 2 (LILRB2), a receptor with immunosuppressive properties belonging to the Leucocytes Ig-Like receptors (LILR) family, is extensively detected in various tumor tissues. Its major ligand, human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G), is pivotal in enabling tumor immune escape. This study sought to investigate the potential impact of LILRB2 gene polymorphisms (rs383369 G > A and rs7247538 C > T) on colorectal cancer (CRC) susceptibility and prognosis in the Tunisian population. METHODS: Genotyping of the LILRB2 gene polymorphisms rs7247538 C > T and rs383369 G > A was performed by PCR-RFLP. A total of 141 CRC patients and 150 healthy controls were included in this case-control study. RESULTS: The rs7247538 C allele and C/C genotype were found to be significantly more prevalent in healthy controls compared to CRC patients (p = 0.008 and p = 0.012, respectively). Furthermore, the C allele was more prevalent in the control subgroup above 50 years compared to CRC patients (p = 0.033). The rs383369 A/A genotype showed a significantly higher prevalence in controls than in CRC patients (p = 0.025). The rs383369 A/G genotype was significantly associated with a higher risk of CRC susceptibility in both the overall study population (p = 0.006) and in patients diagnosed after the age of 50 years (p = 0.014). The concomitant occurrence of both C and A alleles could provide a protective effect against CRC development (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The study indicates that LILRB2 SNPs are associated with susceptibility to CRC within the Tunisian population. These results underscore the relevance of LILRB2 SNPs as important biomarkers in CRC, potentially paving the way for the design of new personalized therapies guided by genetic profiles.",background leukocyt immunoglobulinlik receptor subfamili b member 2 lilrb2 receptor immunosuppress properti belong leucocyt iglik receptor lilr famili extens detect variou tumor tissu major ligand human leukocyt antigen g hlag pivot enabl tumor immun escap studi sought investig potenti impact lilrb2 gene polymorph rs383369 g rs7247538 c colorect cancer crc suscept prognosi tunisian popul method genotyp lilrb2 gene polymorph rs7247538 c rs383369 g perform pcrrflp total 141 crc patient 150 healthi control includ casecontrol studi result rs7247538 c allel cc genotyp found significantli preval healthi control compar crc patient p 0008 p 0012 respect furthermor c allel preval control subgroup 50 year compar crc patient p 0033 rs383369 aa genotyp show significantli higher preval control crc patient p 0025 rs383369 ag genotyp significantli associ higher risk crc suscept overal studi popul p 0006 patient diagnos age 50 year p 0014 concomit occurr c allel could provid protect effect crc develop p 0003 conclus studi indic lilrb2 snp associ suscept crc within tunisian popul result underscor relev lilrb2 snp import biomark crc potenti pave way design new person therapi guid genet profil
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Targeted therapy is the first-line treatment for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors (VEGFRis) constituting the bulk of regimens used. Although the repertoire of VEGFRis for RCC now spans from sunitinib to cabozantinib, resistance to treatments has emerged as a common and prominent challenge. Thus, identifying novel therapeutic targets has become essential for enhancing the antitumor efficacy of current treatments and inhibiting RCC progression. METHOD: To investigate the potential mechanisms underlying VEGFRi resistance in RCC, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 library screen under sunitinib and cabozantinib treatment and identified UBL3 as a key driver of VEGFRi resistance in RCC cells. The critical role of UBL3 in promoting VEGFRi resistance was validated using CCK8 assays, flow cytometry, TUNEL assays, and bioinformatics analyses. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying UBL3, we utilized western blotting, RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation, small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) isolation, and Astral-DIA proteomics. The contribution of UBL3 to VEGFRi resistance was further confirmed through comprehensive in vitro and in vivo experiments. RESULTS: UBL3 was confirmed to suppress apoptosis and promote VEGFRi resistance through NOTCH signaling activation. Further investigations highlighted the importance of NOTCH signaling in VEGFRi resistance in RCC via the NOTCH-PTEN-AKT and NOTCH-FOS pathways and revealed the mechanisms by which UBL3 activated NOTCH signaling. On the one hand, UBL3 formed complex with NOTCH2 and ADAM17 simultaneously, accelerating ADAM17-mediated cleavage of NOTCH2. On the other hand, UBL3-modified NOTCH2 was sorted into sEVs, which were taken up by recipient cells, activating NOTCH signaling and thereby transmitting VEGFRi resistance. Finally, lipid nanoparticle-mediated delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 knockout system targeting UBL3 effectively restored the sensitivity of RCC tumors to VEGFRis. CONCLUSION: This study emphasized the importance of UBL3 in VEGFRi resistance in RCC and proposed that UBL3 activated NOTCH signaling through two distinct pathways, thereby suppressing cancer apoptosis and promoting resistance to VEGFRis. These findings provided a solid scientific foundation and paved the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for patients with advanced RCC.",background target therapi firstlin treatment patient metastat renal cell carcinoma rcc vascular endotheli growth factor receptor inhibitor vegfri constitut bulk regimen use although repertoir vegfri rcc span sunitinib cabozantinib resist treatment emerg common promin challeng thu identifi novel therapeut target becom essenti enhanc antitumor efficaci current treatment inhibit rcc progress method investig potenti mechan underli vegfri resist rcc perform genomewid crisprcas9 librari screen sunitinib cabozantinib treatment identifi ubl3 key driver vegfri resist rcc cell critic role ubl3 promot vegfri resist valid use cck8 assay flow cytometri tunel assay bioinformat analys elucid molecular mechan underli ubl3 util western blot rna sequenc chromatin immunoprecipit small extracellular vesicl sev isol astraldia proteom contribut ubl3 vegfri resist confirm comprehens vitro vivo experi result ubl3 confirm suppress apoptosi promot vegfri resist notch signal activ investig highlight import notch signal vegfri resist rcc via notchptenakt notchfo pathway reveal mechan ubl3 activ notch signal one hand ubl3 form complex notch2 adam17 simultan acceler adam17medi cleavag notch2 hand ubl3modifi notch2 sort sev taken recipi cell activ notch signal therebi transmit vegfri resist final lipid nanoparticlemedi deliveri crisprcas9 knockout system target ubl3 effect restor sensit rcc tumor vegfri conclus studi emphas import ubl3 vegfri resist rcc propos ubl3 activ notch signal two distinct pathway therebi suppress cancer apoptosi promot resist vegfri find provid solid scientif foundat pave way develop novel therapeut strategi patient advanc rcc
cancer,"BACKGROUND: According to LACE analysis, patients diagnosed with p-Stage II-III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are usually indicated for adjuvant chemotherapy, including platinum doublets. We aimed to identify the risk of recurrence in NSCLC patients without lymph node metastasis. METHODS: Between 2009 and 2018, 187 patients underwent lung resection of one or more lobes and mediastinal lymph node dissection for p-Stage II-IIIA NSCLC. Among them, 112 were included after excluding those with a history of lung cancer, perioperative chemotherapy. Staging was based on 8th Edition of IASLC staging system. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify important prognostic factors for oncologic outcomes. RESULTS: Among the evaluated patients, 84 were male, and with a median age of 67 years. Seventy-one (51.4 %) patients were diagnosed with adenocarcinoma. The cancer stages were stage IIA in 34 patients, stage IIB in 57 patients, and stage IIIA in 21 patients. Multivariate analysis of disease-free survival revealed that vascular invasion (HR, 2.481; 95 %CI, 1.411-4.362, P < 0.01) and pathological T factor (HR, 1.819; 95 %CI, 1.226-2.699, P < 0.01) were the independent risk factors. Gray's test for equality of cumulative incidence functions revealed that the five-year cumulative incidence of recurrence was particularly high in patients with vascular invasion compared to that in patients without vascular invasion (21.5 % vs. 37.5 %, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Vascular invasion is a significant predictor of lung cancer recurrence in patients with p-Stage II-IIIA NSCLC without lymph node metastasis. The patients without vascular invasion in this cohort had a favorable prognosis, with a 5-year recurrence rate of 21.5 %.",background accord lace analysi patient diagnos pstage iiiii nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc usual indic adjuv chemotherapi includ platinum doublet aim identifi risk recurr nsclc patient without lymph node metastasi method 2009 2018 187 patient underw lung resect one lobe mediastin lymph node dissect pstage iiiiia nsclc among 112 includ exclud histori lung cancer periop chemotherapi stage base 8th edit iaslc stage system multivari analysi perform identifi import prognost factor oncolog outcom result among evalu patient 84 male median age 67 year seventyon 514 patient diagnos adenocarcinoma cancer stage stage iia 34 patient stage iib 57 patient stage iiia 21 patient multivari analysi diseasefre surviv reveal vascular invas hr 2481 95 ci 14114362 p 001 patholog factor hr 1819 95 ci 12262699 p 001 independ risk factor gray test equal cumul incid function reveal fiveyear cumul incid recurr particularli high patient vascular invas compar patient without vascular invas 215 vs 375 p 003 conclus vascular invas signific predictor lung cancer recurr patient pstage iiiiia nsclc without lymph node metastasi patient without vascular invas cohort favor prognosi 5year recurr rate 215
cancer,"BACKGROUND: PREDICT Breast is a clinical decision-support tool estimating prognosis and the absolute benefit of adjuvant systemic therapies in early breast cancer. PREDICT v2.2 is recommended in Dutch guidelines. Both v2.2 and the recently updated v3.1 have not been validated in the Dutch population. This study compares the predictive performance of PREDICT v3.1 and v2.2 for 10-year OS in Dutch breast cancer patients. METHODS: Women diagnosed between 2005 and 2013 with primary invasive breast cancer were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Ten-year OS predictions from v2.2 and v3.1 were compared with observed OS for the overall cohort and 36 subgroups defined by oestrogen receptor (ER) status, HER2-status, age, and tumour stage. Discrimination (ability to distinguish patients with different outcomes) and calibration (agreement between predicted and observed outcomes) of both models were assessed. RESULTS: Among 101,282 patients, both versions showed moderate discrimination (AUC v2.2 = 0.768; v3.1 = 0.775) and calibration (v2.2 intercept: 0.07; slope: 1.09; v3.1 intercept: 0.12, slope: 1.00). V3.1 slightly overestimated (1.9%), whereas v2.2 slightly underestimated (1.6%) 10-year OS. Across subgroups, v3.1 generally outperformed v2.2 except in patients aged >75 years, where v2.2 provided more accurate estimates. In ER-/HER- patients aged 50-75 years, v3.1 overestimated (1.5-2.8%) and v2.2 underestimated (2.8-5.3%) 10-year OS. CONCLUSION: Both PREDICT v2.2 and v3.1 accurately predict 10-year OS in Dutch breast cancer patients, with small differences between versions that vary by subgroup. No single model is optimal for all patients highlighting the need for subgroup-specific recalibration and careful interpretation when applying PREDICT.",background predict breast clinic decisionsupport tool estim prognosi absolut benefit adjuv system therapi earli breast cancer predict v22 recommend dutch guidelin v22 recent updat v31 valid dutch popul studi compar predict perform predict v31 v22 10year os dutch breast cancer patient method women diagnos 2005 2013 primari invas breast cancer select netherland cancer registri tenyear os predict v22 v31 compar observ os overal cohort 36 subgroup defin oestrogen receptor er statu her2statu age tumour stage discrimin abil distinguish patient differ outcom calibr agreement predict observ outcom model assess result among 101282 patient version show moder discrimin auc v22 0768 v31 0775 calibr v22 intercept 007 slope 109 v31 intercept 012 slope 100 v31 slightli overestim 19 wherea v22 slightli underestim 16 10year os across subgroup v31 gener outperform v22 except patient age 75 year v22 provid accur estim erher patient age 5075 year v31 overestim 1528 v22 underestim 2853 10year os conclus predict v22 v31 accur predict 10year os dutch breast cancer patient small differ version vari subgroup singl model optim patient highlight need subgroupspecif recalibr care interpret appli predict
cancer,"Xuan Wei has China's highest female lung cancer mortality, attributed to household coal smoke exposure. While coal-derived polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were previously blamed, persistently rising lung cancer rates despite PAH reductions implicate other carcinogens. Here, we aim to investigate iron-rich minerals in Late Permian coal as potential overlooked drivers. Coal was sampled from Laibin, epicentre of Xuan Wei lung cancer epidemic. Mineral phases in low temperature ash (LTA) were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) along with selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Mineral morphology and elemental composition were examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and TEM equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). Lung tissues from 10 patients (5 female, 5 male) were examined for mineral deposition by SEM and TEM. We identified acicular iron-rich interstratified berthierine-chamosite minerals coating quartz/calcite in coal. Berthierine shares the serpentine group classification with chrysotile (i.e., white asbestos, a known human carcinogen). We observed abundant berthierine-chamosite needles in cancerous and para-cancerous lung tissues, with iron leaching from the berthierine-chamosite into acidic digestive vacuoles and accumulating in holo-ferritin and hemosiderin aggregates within autolysosomes. Given its much higher iron content than chrysotile, this needle-like berthierine-chamosite in Late Permian coal could be more bioactive and toxic, potentially driving the lung cancer epidemic in Xuan Wei, China. Our findings call for closer collaboration between mineralogists and health scientists for future research to gain deeper mechanistic insights and formulate intervention strategies.",xuan wei china highest femal lung cancer mortal attribut household coal smoke exposur coalderiv polycycl aromat hydrocarbon pah previous blame persist rise lung cancer rate despit pah reduct implic carcinogen aim investig ironrich miner late permian coal potenti overlook driver coal sampl laibin epicentr xuan wei lung cancer epidem miner phase low temperatur ash lta character xray diffract xrd along select area electron diffract sa highresolut transmiss electron microscopi tem miner morpholog element composit examin scan electron microscop sem tem equip energydispers xray spectromet ed lung tissu 10 patient 5 femal 5 male examin miner deposit sem tem identifi acicular ironrich interstratifi berthierinechamosit miner coat quartzcalcit coal berthierin share serpentin group classif chrysotil ie white asbesto known human carcinogen observ abund berthierinechamosit needl cancer paracancer lung tissu iron leach berthierinechamosit acid digest vacuol accumul holoferritin hemosiderin aggreg within autolysosom given much higher iron content chrysotil needlelik berthierinechamosit late permian coal could bioactiv toxic potenti drive lung cancer epidem xuan wei china find call closer collabor mineralogist health scientist futur research gain deeper mechanist insight formul intervent strategi
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Women of low socioeconomic status (SES) are at increased risk for being diagnosed with later stage breast cancer and experience poorer survival. However, younger women, especially women under 40, are underrepresented in breast cancer research given screening mammography is not recommended until age 40. How SES impacts stage at diagnosis and survival rates in women under 40 diagnosed with breast cancer has not been addressed. METHODS: Data was obtained from the national Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)*Stat Research Plus Census Tract Attributes Specialty Database, including 27 unique variables representing patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics. Proportional odds logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between SES and stage at diagnosis and Kaplan-Meier curves along with Cox-proportional hazards models were used to assess the relationship between SES and survival months. RESULTS: In both women of all ages and in women under 40, lower SES was significantly associated with later stage at breast cancer diagnosis (P < .001), poorer five-year (P < .001), and ten-year (P < .001) overall and breast-cancer specific survival rates in an incremental fashion. CONCLUSION: SES significantly impacts breast cancer stage at diagnosis and survival rates in a graded fashion, with lowering SES corresponding with later stage at breast cancer diagnosis and poorer five-year and ten-year survival rates across all age groups, including women under 40. Improving screening rates in low SES populations and initiating high risk screening strategies at an earlier age in women with low SES may help ameliorate these disparities.",background breast cancer common cancer women women low socioeconom statu se increas risk diagnos later stage breast cancer experi poorer surviv howev younger women especi women 40 underrepres breast cancer research given screen mammographi recommend age 40 se impact stage diagnosi surviv rate women 40 diagnos breast cancer address method data obtain nation surveil epidemiolog end result seerstat research plu censu tract attribut specialti databas includ 27 uniqu variabl repres patient tumor treatment characterist proport odd logist regress model use assess relationship se stage diagnosi kaplanmei curv along coxproport hazard model use assess relationship se surviv month result women age women 40 lower se significantli associ later stage breast cancer diagnosi p 001 poorer fiveyear p 001 tenyear p 001 overal breastcanc specif surviv rate increment fashion conclus se significantli impact breast cancer stage diagnosi surviv rate grade fashion lower se correspond later stage breast cancer diagnosi poorer fiveyear tenyear surviv rate across age group includ women 40 improv screen rate low se popul initi high risk screen strategi earlier age women low se may help amelior dispar
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) prevention and treatment have always been a difficult problem to solve. Therefore, mining the molecular genes related to the progression of GC and predicting the progression of GC has important clinical significance. Therefore, this study investigated whether the P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2R) has a certain effect on GC. METHODS: The correlation data of P2Y2R and GC tissues from public databases was collected, and the relationship between P2Y2R and the survival and prognosis of GC patients was analyzed. Moreover, the expression of P2Y2R in GC cells AGS, MGC803, HGC27 and normal GES-1 was detected by Western-blotting. Cell scratch, Transwell invasion and YF phalloidin assays were used to investigate the effects of P2Y2R on migration and invasion of GC cells. RESULTS: P2Y2R was highly expressed in GC tissues and was negatively correlated with poor survival and prognosis of patients with GC. Activation of the P2Y2R by UTP promoted the migration and invasion of GC cells. However, the P2Y2R-specific antagonist AR-C118925XX inhibited the migration and invasion of GC cells. In addition, P2Y2R activation enhanced cytoskeletal stress changes in GC cells and promoted GC motility, while inhibition of its activity yielded the opposite effect. In addition, activation of P2Y2R increased the expression levels of p-PKC, p-Src, and p-ERK1/2, while AR-C118925XX treatment significantly decreased the expression levels of p-PKC, p-Src, and p-ERK1/2. CONCLUSION: High expression of P2Y2R is negatively correlated with survival and prognosis of GC patients. P2Y2R activation promotes GC progression may be related to PKC/Src and ERK signaling, indicating that P2Y2R may serve as a new molecular target for GC prevention and treatment.",background gastric cancer gc prevent treatment alway difficult problem solv therefor mine molecular gene relat progress gc predict progress gc import clinic signific therefor studi investig whether p2y2 receptor p2y2r certain effect gc method correl data p2y2r gc tissu public databas collect relationship p2y2r surviv prognosi gc patient analyz moreov express p2y2r gc cell ag mgc803 hgc27 normal ges1 detect westernblot cell scratch transwel invas yf phalloidin assay use investig effect p2y2r migrat invas gc cell result p2y2r highli express gc tissu neg correl poor surviv prognosi patient gc activ p2y2r utp promot migrat invas gc cell howev p2y2rspecif antagonist arc118925xx inhibit migrat invas gc cell addit p2y2r activ enhanc cytoskelet stress chang gc cell promot gc motil inhibit activ yield opposit effect addit activ p2y2r increas express level ppkc psrc perk12 arc118925xx treatment significantli decreas express level ppkc psrc perk12 conclus high express p2y2r neg correl surviv prognosi gc patient p2y2r activ promot gc progress may relat pkcsrc erk signal indic p2y2r may serv new molecular target gc prevent treatment
cancer,"The universal posttranslational modification ubiquitination was originally discovered in the 1980s as a tag appended to cellular proteins to mark them for degradation by the 26S proteasomal complex. Subsequent discoveries have established ubiquitination as a process that directs spatial and temporal activities of proteins that are integral to all biochemical pathways in cells, in addition to its canonical role in facilitating life-death decisions of proteins. Protein ubiquitination is counterbalanced by  approximately 100 enzymes called deubiquitinases (DUBs) expressed in human cells. Although ubiquitination affects a plethora of cellular functions, the role of DUBs was initially linked to neuronal development, and later to cancer, where deregulation of protein degradation coincided with both increased expression of DUBs and worsening of disease pathology. As such, inhibition of DUBs has been regarded as a therapeutic approach for various cancers, and major investments of time and resources have been dedicated for developing DUB inhibitors for cancer therapy. The important roles of DUBs in the cardiovascular system have only recently been appreciated. DUBs play a protective anti-inflammatory role in the vascular smooth muscle, endothelium, as well as macrophages, and also serve to mitigate pathological remodeling of the myocardium in mice. Activation or positive allosteric modulation of DUBs could provide therapeutic benefit in the 2 major cardiovascular diseases, atherosclerosis and heart failure. In this review, we highlight the roles of select DUBs that have been characterized for their critical functions in the heart and vasculature. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Cardiovascular diseases represent a major global health burden and remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, accounting for approximately 18 million deaths annually worldwide. Among these, atherosclerosis and heart failure are 2 interrelated conditions with multifactorial, chronic, and complex etiologies, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutic strategies to reduce mortality and improve quality of life. Emerging evidence suggests that several deubiquitinases exert protective effects by attenuating atherosclerosis and cardiac dysfunction in murine models, highlighting the potential of deubiquitinase modulators to serve as novel therapeutic agents for cardiovascular diseases.",univers posttransl modif ubiquitin origin discov 1980 tag append cellular protein mark degrad 26 proteasom complex subsequ discoveri establish ubiquitin process direct spatial tempor activ protein integr biochem pathway cell addit canon role facilit lifedeath decis protein protein ubiquitin counterbalanc approxim 100 enzym call deubiquitinas dub express human cell although ubiquitin affect plethora cellular function role dub initi link neuron develop later cancer deregul protein degrad coincid increas express dub worsen diseas patholog inhibit dub regard therapeut approach variou cancer major invest time resourc dedic develop dub inhibitor cancer therapi import role dub cardiovascular system recent appreci dub play protect antiinflammatori role vascular smooth muscl endothelium well macrophag also serv mitig patholog remodel myocardium mice activ posit alloster modul dub could provid therapeut benefit 2 major cardiovascular diseas atherosclerosi heart failur review highlight role select dub character critic function heart vasculatur signific statement cardiovascular diseas repres major global health burden remain lead caus morbid mortal account approxim 18 million death annual worldwid among atherosclerosi heart failur 2 interrel condit multifactori chronic complex etiolog necessit develop effect therapeut strategi reduc mortal improv qualiti life emerg evid suggest sever deubiquitinas exert protect effect attenu atherosclerosi cardiac dysfunct murin model highlight potenti deubiquitinas modul serv novel therapeut agent cardiovascular diseas
cancer,"OBJECTIVES: Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a systemic condition characterized by ligamentous ossification along the spine. While its prevalence has been well described in the general population, data on its occurrence in oncology patients remain limited. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and distribution of DISH and early-phase DISH in newly diagnosed cancer patients undergoing initial staging with Computed Tomography (CT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 1053 adult oncology patients who underwent thoraco-abdominopelvic CT for initial staging were evaluated. DISH and early-phase DISH were diagnosed using established radiologic criteria. Vertebral body densities were measured, and associated extraspinal enthesopathies and ligamentous ossifications were documented. RESULTS: DISH was present in 30.3 % of patients, including 13.8 % with established DISH and 16.5 % with early-phase DISH. Prevalence was higher in older patients and males (p < 0.01). Notably, renal (43.2 %), gastric (37.5 %), and colorectal (33.7 %) cancers demonstrated significantly higher DISH rates, whereas esophageal cancer showed a lower prevalence (13.4 %). DISH was associated with decreased vertebral bone density and frequent extraspinal enthesopathies. No significant correlations were found with BMI, diabetes, or hypertension.

cancer,"The challenge of overcoming drug-resistant mutations in Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK), a critical driver of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), remains a pressing clinical concern. This study introduces a novel approach by using polyhedral alkanes as linkers in PROTAC (Proteolysis Targeting Chimera) technology to address resistance mechanisms. Unlike conventional chain-like or planar linkers, five novel ALK-targeting PROTACs (BL-1-BL-5) featuring structurally unique polyhedral alkanes (cubane, homocubane, adamantane, D(3)-trihomocubane and norbornene) were designed and synthesized through innovative HAPOD trail and organic synthesis methodologies. Comprehensive in vitro evaluations revealed remarkable antiproliferative activity across all derivatives, with BL-5 (norbornene as linker) demonstrating exceptional potency (IC(5)(0) = 36.21 nM) against H3122 cells, surpassing both reference SIAIS164018 (BB-1, IC(5)(0) = 78.93 nM) and Brigatinib (IC(5)(0) = 44.83 nM). Western blot assay confirmed that BL-5 effectively degraded ALK at 100 nM concentration while effectively inhibiting ALK phosphorylation. Notably, BL-5 exhibited superior efficacy against Ba/F3 cells with the ALK G1202R resistance mutation (IC(50) = 118.86 nM) compared to BB-1 (IC(5)(0) = 126.41 nM). MD simulations provided critical insights, revealing that the BL-1, BL-4 and BL-5 significantly enhanced the ternary complex stability compared to traditional linkers. These findings establish the polyhedral alkanes as novel linkers in PROTAC design, with BL-5 emerging as a particularly promising candidate for targeting ALK.",challeng overcom drugresist mutat anaplast lymphoma kinas alk critic driver nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc remain press clinic concern studi introduc novel approach use polyhedr alkan linker protac proteolysi target chimera technolog address resist mechan unlik convent chainlik planar linker five novel alktarget protac bl1bl5 featur structur uniqu polyhedr alkan cuban homocuban adamantan d3trihomocuban norbornen design synthes innov hapod trail organ synthesi methodolog comprehens vitro evalu reveal remark antiprolif activ across deriv bl5 norbornen linker demonstr except potenc ic50 3621 nm h3122 cell surpass refer siais164018 bb1 ic50 7893 nm brigatinib ic50 4483 nm western blot assay confirm bl5 effect degrad alk 100 nm concentr effect inhibit alk phosphoryl notabl bl5 exhibit superior efficaci baf3 cell alk g1202r resist mutat ic50 11886 nm compar bb1 ic50 12641 nm md simul provid critic insight reveal bl1 bl4 bl5 significantli enhanc ternari complex stabil compar tradit linker find establish polyhedr alkan novel linker protac design bl5 emerg particularli promis candid target alk
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has transformed the treatment paradigm for HER2-expressing breast cancer, including HER2-low disease. However, biomarkers associated with T-DXd activity remain poorly defined. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of clinical, genomic, and immune correlates of T-DXd outcomes to identify molecular determinants of therapeutic benefit and resistance. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 2 independent cohorts of patients with advanced breast cancer treated with T-DXd at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Yale Cancer Center between 2018 and 2024. We included patients with >/=2 tumor blocks with HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assessments prior to T-DXd. Clinical data on 524 patients were manually reviewed, and genomic profiling and immune microenvironment assessments were performed on a subset of patients. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models evaluated associations between molecular features and overall survival (OS) and time to next treatment (TTNT). RESULTS: Among 524 patients, HER2 IHC discordance between sequential tumor biopsies was observed in 20% of patients and was independently associated with significantly worse OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.67; P = .012) and TTNT (HR = 0.65; P = .002), resembling outcomes seen in HER2 0 tumors. Genomic analysis revealed that PTEN mutations correlated with inferior TTNT (HR = 2.2; q = 0.068), whereas ERBB2 amplifications predicted improved OS and TTNT. An inflamed tumor microenvironment determined by digital pathology was associated with significantly poorer TTNT outcomes (median TTNT = 5.5 months) compared with immune-desert phenotypes (median OS = 9.6 months, P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies HER2 IHC discordance and specific genomic and immune features as prognostic biomarkers of T-DXd efficacy. These findings warrant prospective validation and may inform biomarker-driven strategies to optimize T-DXd therapy in HER2-expressing malignancies.",background trastuzumab deruxtecan tdxd transform treatment paradigm her2express breast cancer includ her2low diseas howev biomark associ tdxd activ remain poorli defin conduct comprehens analysi clinic genom immun correl tdxd outcom identifi molecular determin therapeut benefit resist method retrospect analyz 2 independ cohort patient advanc breast cancer treat tdxd danafarb cancer institut yale cancer center 2018 2024 includ patient 2 tumor block her2 immunohistochemistri ihc assess prior tdxd clinic data 524 patient manual review genom profil immun microenviron assess perform subset patient multivari cox proport hazard model evalu associ molecular featur overal surviv os time next treatment ttnt result among 524 patient her2 ihc discord sequenti tumor biopsi observ 20 patient independ associ significantli wors os hazard ratio hr 067 p 012 ttnt hr 065 p 002 resembl outcom seen her2 0 tumor genom analysi reveal pten mutat correl inferior ttnt hr 22 q 0068 wherea erbb2 amplif predict improv os ttnt inflam tumor microenviron determin digit patholog associ significantli poorer ttnt outcom median ttnt 55 month compar immunedesert phenotyp median os 96 month p 03 conclus studi identifi her2 ihc discord specif genom immun featur prognost biomark tdxd efficaci find warrant prospect valid may inform biomarkerdriven strategi optim tdxd therapi her2express malign
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the anti-tumor efficacy and underlying molecular mechanisms of prodigiosin (PG) in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). METHODS: The anti-cancer effects of PG were systematically evaluated in vitro using PTC cell lines and in vivo via xenograft mouse models. Cell viability and dose-response relationships were determined by CCK-8 assays. Anti-proliferative activity was assessed through colony formation and EdU incorporation assays. The impact on metastatic potential was examined by scratch wound healing and Matrigel-based transwell migration and invasion assays. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using flow cytometry. RESULTS: In vitro, PG at 500 nM inhibited the growth of BCPAP and TPC-1 cells by 93.5 % and 89.2 %, respectively, as determined by colony formation assays. Migration and invasion of BCPAP cells were reduced by 90.7 % and 93.4 %, measured via scratch wound healing and transwell assays. PG treatment modulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers both in vitro and in vivo, characterized by downregulating mesenchymal proteins and upregulating epithelial proteins, accompanied by changes in Wnt/beta-catenin pathway-related proteins, indicating suppression of EMT. Flow cytometry revealed that PG induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in both BCPAP and TPC-1 cells. Furthermore, PG upregulated the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), enhancing radioiodine uptake. Moreover, the treatment of PG significantly inhibited tumor growth without notable toxicity in vivo. CONCLUSION: PG exerts potent anti-tumor activity against PTC by simultaneously inhibiting proliferation, migration, and invasion, inducing cell cycle arrest, and enhancing radioiodine uptake, potentially through modulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Our findings position PG as a highly promising, potentially transformative therapeutic candidate for PTC, offering a strategic approach to overcome conventional therapy resistance and improve clinical outcomes.",object investig antitumor efficaci underli molecular mechan prodigiosin pg papillari thyroid cancer ptc method anticanc effect pg systemat evalu vitro use ptc cell line vivo via xenograft mous model cell viabil doserespons relationship determin cck8 assay antiprolif activ assess coloni format edu incorpor assay impact metastat potenti examin scratch wound heal matrigelbas transwel migrat invas assay cell cycl distribut analyz use flow cytometri result vitro pg 500 nm inhibit growth bcpap tpc1 cell 935 892 respect determin coloni format assay migrat invas bcpap cell reduc 907 934 measur via scratch wound heal transwel assay pg treatment modul epithelialmesenchym transit emt marker vitro vivo character downregul mesenchym protein upregul epitheli protein accompani chang wntbetacatenin pathwayrel protein indic suppress emt flow cytometri reveal pg induc g0g1 cell cycl arrest bcpap tpc1 cell furthermor pg upregul sodiumiodid symport ni enhanc radioiodin uptak moreov treatment pg significantli inhibit tumor growth without notabl toxic vivo conclus pg exert potent antitumor activ ptc simultan inhibit prolifer migrat invas induc cell cycl arrest enhanc radioiodin uptak potenti modul wntbetacatenin signal pathway find posit pg highli promis potenti transform therapeut candid ptc offer strateg approach overcom convent therapi resist improv clinic outcom
cancer,"BACKGROUND: BRAF/MEK inhibitors are a cornerstone of the therapy of BRAF-mutant cancers. Despite frequent use, the incidence of cardiovascular side effects is still unclear. Data on cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD), particularly using contemporary biomarker-inclusive definitions, remain limited. OBJECTIVES: To assess the incidence and risk factors of CTRCD in patients receiving BRAF/MEK inhibitors, using the International Cardio-Oncology Society (ICOS) definitions, which include cardiac imaging and biomarker assessments. METHODS: A total of 75 patients treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors underwent prospective cardiotoxicity monitoring with two follow-up visits at 90 days (IQR 36-137 days) and 199 days (IQR 115-266 days). Standardized evaluations included echocardiography with global longitudinal strain (GLS), high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), and NT-proBNP measurements at baseline and follow-up visits. CTRCD was classified according to ICOS criteria. Baseline risk was stratified by European Society of Cardiology (ESC) risk categories. RESULTS: CTRCD occurred in 33 of 75 patients (44 %), with 17 % classified as mild, 23 % moderate, and 4 % severe. Baseline age, sex, BMI, and most cardiovascular risk factors were not significantly associated with CTRCD. Coronary artery disease was the only baseline variable associated with increased CTRCD (OR 11.0, p = 0.029; univariate analysis), whereas elevated hs-cTnT, NT-proBNP, or reduced LVEF at baseline were not predictive. Absolute CTRCD numbers were highest in the high ESC-defined cardiovascular risk category group, while incidence peaked in the low-risk group. Other cardiac complications occurred in 41 patients (55 %). CONCLUSIONS: CTRCD is frequent among patients treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors were not predictive, although coronary artery disease emerged as a strong risk marker. These findings highlight the need for dynamic surveillance strategies.",background brafmek inhibitor cornerston therapi brafmut cancer despit frequent use incid cardiovascular side effect still unclear data cancer therapyrel cardiac dysfunct ctrcd particularli use contemporari biomarkerinclus definit remain limit object assess incid risk factor ctrcd patient receiv brafmek inhibitor use intern cardiooncolog societi ico definit includ cardiac imag biomark assess method total 75 patient treat brafmek inhibitor underw prospect cardiotox monitor two followup visit 90 day iqr 36137 day 199 day iqr 115266 day standard evalu includ echocardiographi global longitudin strain gl highsensit cardiac troponin hsctnt ntprobnp measur baselin followup visit ctrcd classifi accord ico criteria baselin risk stratifi european societi cardiolog esc risk categori result ctrcd occur 33 75 patient 44 17 classifi mild 23 moder 4 sever baselin age sex bmi cardiovascular risk factor significantli associ ctrcd coronari arteri diseas baselin variabl associ increas ctrcd 110 p 0029 univari analysi wherea elev hsctnt ntprobnp reduc lvef baselin predict absolut ctrcd number highest high escdefin cardiovascular risk categori group incid peak lowrisk group cardiac complic occur 41 patient 55 conclus ctrcd frequent among patient treat brafmek inhibitor tradit cardiovascular risk factor predict although coronari arteri diseas emerg strong risk marker find highlight need dynam surveil strategi
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the role of Sialic acid-binding Immunoglobulin-Like Lectin-9 (SIGLEC9), a novel immune checkpoint, in Cervical Cancer (CC) and its interaction with immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. METHODS: SIGLEC9 expression in CC was analyzed using the TNM plot, TCGA, and Human Protein Atlas databases, alongside its correlation with tumor stage. The relationship between SIGLEC9 expression and immune cell infiltration was explored using TCGA and TISIDB databases. Single-cell analysis focused on SIGLEC9 in macrophages. Protein interactions were assessed through the String, IntAct, BioGRID, and Mentha databases. MUC1 expression was validated via GEO and GEPIA databases. Immunohistochemical staining, western blot, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry were used for verification. The prognostic significance of SIGLEC9 and SIGLEC9+ Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs) was evaluated. RESULTS: SIGLEC9 was found to be significantly upregulated in CC, with higher levels correlating with poor prognosis. It was expressed in macrophages and T-cells, and elevated SIGLEC9+ TAMs were linked to reduced overall survival. CONCLUSION: SIGLEC9 plays a crucial role in the progression and prognosis of cervical cancer through its interaction with TAMs and T-cells.

cancer,"The regulation of mitochondrial membrane proteins is of crucial significance for breast cancer therapy. TOM70, which located in mitochondria outer membrane, could import MIC family molecules to preserve mitochondrial homeostasis. However, there are few agents targeting TOM70. Therein, the effects of curcumin and it's mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) on the TOM70 and mitochondrial function for breast cancer treatment were investigated. The 4 T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells were utilized as the breast cancer cells. The 4 T1 cell-bearing mice were constructed as the breast cancer animal model. The anti-cancer efficacy was validated using the CCK-8, Annexin-V/PI staining, colony formation. The associated molecules were detected by Western blots (WB), RT-qPCR, and Immunohistochemistry (IHC). The target was verified by molecular docking, CETSA, and DARTS. The mitochondrial proteins and DNA were extracted for the MIC60 and mtDNA damage detection. Curcumin treatment showed poor efficacy in the breast cancer model, as characterized by cell viability, apoptosis, proliferation of breast cancer cells, and the growth of tumor grafts in mice. However, curcumin-mediated PDT inhibited breast cancer in vitro and in vivo. Further exploration identified curcumin bond to TOM70, which is highly expressed in breast cancer, thereby activating it. But curcumin-induced PDT inactivated TOM70 through generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn interfered with the binding of MIC60 and its translocation into mitochondria. Curcumin-triggered PDT led to severe mitochondrial damage compared with the curcumin treatment, which could be blocked by the N-Acetylcysteine (NAC). Additional TOM70 rescue dampened curcumin PDT-mediated mitochondrial damage and anti-breast cancer efficacy. To summarize, the present research identifies curcumin-induced PDT inactivated TOM70, thereby attenuating MIC60 import, leading to mitochondrial damage against breast cancer. We propose a novel approach to tumor treatment through the regulation of mitochondrial membrane proteins using the phytomedicine-driven PDT.",regul mitochondri membran protein crucial signific breast cancer therapi tom70 locat mitochondria outer membran could import mic famili molecul preserv mitochondri homeostasi howev agent target tom70 therein effect curcumin mediat photodynam therapi pdt tom70 mitochondri function breast cancer treatment investig 4 t1 mdamb231 cell util breast cancer cell 4 t1 cellbear mice construct breast cancer anim model anticanc efficaci valid use cck8 annexinvpi stain coloni format associ molecul detect western blot wb rtqpcr immunohistochemistri ihc target verifi molecular dock cetsa dart mitochondri protein dna extract mic60 mtdna damag detect curcumin treatment show poor efficaci breast cancer model character cell viabil apoptosi prolifer breast cancer cell growth tumor graft mice howev curcuminmedi pdt inhibit breast cancer vitro vivo explor identifi curcumin bond tom70 highli express breast cancer therebi activ curcumininduc pdt inactiv tom70 gener reactiv oxygen speci ro turn interf bind mic60 transloc mitochondria curcumintrigg pdt led sever mitochondri damag compar curcumin treatment could block nacetylcystein nac addit tom70 rescu dampen curcumin pdtmediat mitochondri damag antibreast cancer efficaci summar present research identifi curcumininduc pdt inactiv tom70 therebi attenu mic60 import lead mitochondri damag breast cancer propos novel approach tumor treatment regul mitochondri membran protein use phytomedicinedriven pdt
cancer,"Once considered a non-essential amino acid, L-serine (L-Ser) is now recognized as conditionally essential in the brain, orchestrating a complex network of metabolic and signalling pathways. L-Ser provides carbon units to the one-carbon metabolism, supporting nucleotide synthesis and methylation reactions, and serves as a precursor for phosphatidylserine and sphingolipids. L-Ser plays crucial roles in glutathione and heme metabolism and interfaces with mitochondrial one-carbon pathways, thereby linking it to energy production, redox homeostasis, and epigenetic regulation. Its conversion into glycine and D-serine further supports neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive functions. Throughout the lifespan, L-Ser and its derivatives contribute to maintaining neuronal and glial homeostasis. However, fundamental questions remain regarding how L-Ser biosynthesis, transport, and compartmentalization are coordinated in the intact brain and how their dysregulation contributes to disease. Current knowledge largely derives from cancer biology or in vitro models, and translating these insights to the central nervous system poses major challenges. The lack of specific tools to monitor L-Ser flux in vivo, limited understanding of post-translational regulation of key enzymes and incomplete mapping of transport mechanisms across the blood-brain barrier still hampers deeper mechanistic and translational insight. This review compiles the most recent evidence, emphasizing the translational relevance of L-Ser-based interventions and underscoring the urgent need for systematic clinical trials to fully evaluate its therapeutic potential.",consid nonessenti amino acid lserin lser recogn condit essenti brain orchestr complex network metabol signal pathway lser provid carbon unit onecarbon metabol support nucleotid synthesi methyl reaction serv precursor phosphatidylserin sphingolipid lser play crucial role glutathion heme metabol interfac mitochondri onecarbon pathway therebi link energi product redox homeostasi epigenet regul convers glycin dserin support neurotransmiss synapt plastic cognit function throughout lifespan lser deriv contribut maintain neuron glial homeostasi howev fundament question remain regard lser biosynthesi transport compartment coordin intact brain dysregul contribut diseas current knowledg larg deriv cancer biolog vitro model translat insight central nervou system pose major challeng lack specif tool monitor lser flux vivo limit understand posttransl regul key enzym incomplet map transport mechan across bloodbrain barrier still hamper deeper mechanist translat insight review compil recent evid emphas translat relev lserbas intervent underscor urgent need systemat clinic trial fulli evalu therapeut potenti
cancer,"In 2022, over 662,000 cases of cervical cancer were diagnosed globally and over 348,000 deaths occurred from the disease, with almost 94 % of these deaths occurring in low- and lower-middle income countries (LMIC). Effective intervention strategies, including prophylactic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for adolescents and primary HPV screening for adult women, are highly effective and cost-effective methods of prevention; however, delivering population-wide access to these prevention methods has been challenging, particularly in LMIC. The World Health Organization (WHO) has launched a global strategy for the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem through the scale-up of HPV vaccination, cervical screening and precancer and cancer treatment services. In this review article, we present the rationale, history and strategy behind the global cervical cancer elimination efforts, including the evidence underpinning the WHO's three pillars of cervical cancer control, and essential considerations for implementation, sustainable financing, and health systems implications. Many countries and regions are currently formulating frameworks to achieve cervical cancer elimination within their setting. Here, we consider implementation challenges for both LMIC, and high-income countries (HIC), calling upon the experiences of implementation guided by the WHO Western Pacific Region and Australian frameworks as exemplar settings.",2022 662000 case cervic cancer diagnos global 348000 death occur diseas almost 94 death occur low lowermiddl incom countri lmic effect intervent strategi includ prophylact human papillomaviru hpv vaccin adolesc primari hpv screen adult women highli effect costeffect method prevent howev deliv populationwid access prevent method challeng particularli lmic world health organ launch global strategi elimin cervic cancer public health problem scaleup hpv vaccin cervic screen precanc cancer treatment servic review articl present rational histori strategi behind global cervic cancer elimin effort includ evid underpin who three pillar cervic cancer control essenti consider implement sustain financ health system implic mani countri region current formul framework achiev cervic cancer elimin within set consid implement challeng lmic highincom countri hic call upon experi implement guid western pacif region australian framework exemplar set
cancer,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were assessed in surface water and sediments of the Nilufer Stream, Bursa, Turkiye, to characterize their distribution, sources, water-sediment interactions, and associated ecological and human health risks. Samples collected from seven sites (S1-S7) revealed that the dissolved- and particulate-phase PAH concentrations in the waters ranged from 2.3 to 1118.5 mug/L and 0.3 to 422.0 mug/L, respectively, while sediments contained 32.2-836.6 ng/g dry weight. Upstream sites (S1-S2) exhibited minimal contamination, whereas downstream locations (S3-S7) reflected increasing PAH loads influenced by mixed urban, industrial, and agricultural pressures. Ring-distribution profiles showed LMW dominance in the dissolved phase and stronger MMW-HMW enrichment in particulate phase and sediments, while diagnostic ratios indicated predominantly pyrogenic inputs, particularly traffic emissions and biomass/coal combustion. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) further supported these findings, with PC1 capturing the majority of variance across dissolved- and particulate phases, and sediment as a unified pyrogenic factor, and PC2 distinguishing high-temperature industrial combustion from medium-temperature domestic heating, especially in downstream segments. Ecological risk indices (M-ERM-Q, M-PEL-Q, TEQCARC, MEQ) indicated low-to-moderate potential adverse effects, mainly in sediments. Water-sediment partitioning suggested that sediments act as long-term sinks modulated by organic carbon and hydrodynamics. Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR) values indicated negligible risk at S1-S2 but moderate cancer risk at S3-S7 for adults and children through ingestion and inhalation. Overall, the study provides a comprehensive spatial-temporal evaluation of PAH behavior in a mixed land-use watershed and integrates source-diagnostic and risk-based evidence to support targeted mitigation strategies in urban-industrial river systems.",polycycl aromat hydrocarbon pah assess surfac water sediment niluf stream bursa turkiy character distribut sourc watersedi interact associ ecolog human health risk sampl collect seven site s1s7 reveal dissolv particulatephas pah concentr water rang 23 11185 mugl 03 4220 mugl respect sediment contain 3228366 ngg dri weight upstream site s1s2 exhibit minim contamin wherea downstream locat s3s7 reflect increas pah load influenc mix urban industri agricultur pressur ringdistribut profil show lmw domin dissolv phase stronger mmwhmw enrich particul phase sediment diagnost ratio indic predominantli pyrogen input particularli traffic emiss biomassco combust princip compon analysi pca support find pc1 captur major varianc across dissolv particul phase sediment unifi pyrogen factor pc2 distinguish hightemperatur industri combust mediumtemperatur domest heat especi downstream segment ecolog risk indic mermq mpelq teqcarc meq indic lowtomoder potenti advers effect mainli sediment watersedi partit suggest sediment act longterm sink modul organ carbon hydrodynam increment lifetim cancer risk ilcr valu indic neglig risk s1s2 moder cancer risk s3s7 adult children ingest inhal overal studi provid comprehens spatialtempor evalu pah behavior mix landus watersh integr sourcediagnost riskbas evid support target mitig strategi urbanindustri river system
cancer,"Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, is frequently overexpressed and amplified in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) as well as in several other malignancies, contributing to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. The present study employed a multi-step virtual screening approach to identify potential inhibitors of the Mcl-1 protein and subsequently validated their inhibitory activity through computational approaches. The 3-D structure of Mcl-1 protein was retrieved from the protein data bank and subjected to structure-based virtual screening. A series of drug-likeness and ADMET filters, including Lipinski filter, Swiss ADME, ADME-Tox, pKCSM and Protox-3 web, were applied to prioritize the compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile. Further evaluated by molecular docking, with particular emphasis on -CDOCKER interaction energy, identified tolbutamide (-101.09 kcal/mol), leucodelphinidin (-89.304 kcal/mol), and gossypetin -70.49 (kcal/mol) as, most promising candidates. To assess the conformational stability and dynamic behavior of the protein-ligand complexes, molecular dynamics simulation was performed for 100ns and extended to 500 ns for the best screened compound. Trajectory analysis was conducted using multiple descriptors, including root mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuation, the radius of gyration, solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), hydrogen bonds, and free energy landscape. In vitro toxicity studies using the MTT assay on the K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cell line demonstrated a significant reduction in cell viability, indicating potent antiproliferative activity. These computational studies highlight novel compounds as potent Mcl-1 inhibitors, suggesting their potential as promising therapeutic candidates for the treatment of CML. These findings lay the foundation for further optimization and preclinical evaluation of Mcl-1 targeted compounds in cancer therapy.",myeloid cell leukemia1 mcl1 antiapoptot member bcl2 famili frequent overexpress amplifi chronic myeloid leukemia cml well sever malign contribut tumor progress therapeut resist present studi employ multistep virtual screen approach identifi potenti inhibitor mcl1 protein subsequ valid inhibitori activ comput approach 3d structur mcl1 protein retriev protein data bank subject structurebas virtual screen seri druglik admet filter includ lipinski filter swiss adm admetox pkcsm protox3 web appli priorit compound favor pharmacokinet toxic profil evalu molecular dock particular emphasi cdocker interact energi identifi tolbutamid 10109 kcalmol leucodelphinidin 89304 kcalmol gossypetin 7049 kcalmol promis candid assess conform stabil dynam behavior proteinligand complex molecular dynam simul perform 100n extend 500 ns best screen compound trajectori analysi conduct use multipl descriptor includ root mean squar deviat root mean squar fluctuat radiu gyrat solventaccess surfac area sasa hydrogen bond free energi landscap vitro toxic studi use mtt assay k562 chronic myeloid leukemia cell line demonstr signific reduct cell viabil indic potent antiprolif activ comput studi highlight novel compound potent mcl1 inhibitor suggest potenti promis therapeut candid treatment cml find lay foundat optim preclin evalu mcl1 target compound cancer therapi
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To classify digital mammograms based on radiological findings using morphology and texture descriptors with artificial neural networks (ANN) for breast cancer detection. APPROACH: The mammography dataset from High Specialty Regional Hospital of Oaxaca (HRAEO) (median patient age (mpa), 48 years [interquartile range (IQR), 41-54 years]) with radiological findings was retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent breast biopsy and were not previously treated. External testing was performed using mammograms from the National Cancer Institute (INCAN) (mpa: 47 years [IQR, 37-62 years]). The morphology was analyzed using a circularity descriptor (), and the texture was analyzed using the mean height/width ratio of the extrema descriptor (). These results were compared with cancer/benign histopathology, which was binarily classified using ANNs. The F1-score, Cohen's kappa (K), and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were employed as evaluation metrics, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for statistical analysis (h = 0, with p > 0.05, was considered as not statistically significant). MAIN RESULTS: 216 raw mammograms from HRAEO and 33 mammograms from INCAN (95+16 breast cancer and 121+17 benign findings) were included. The best internal testing results were obtained with a one-hidden-layer ANN with 100 neurons, achieving a F1-score of 0.95, K of 0.91, and an AUC of 0.953 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.917, 0.977) (h=0, p>0.99). However, the external testing results were significantly lower: 0.38 F1-score, 0.02 K, and 0.509 AUC (95% CI: 0.344, 0.664) (h=0, p=0.14) due to not exactly meeting the inclusion criteria and possible demographic and spectrum bias, or domain-adaptation issues. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed morphology () and texture () descriptors show promise for detecting breast cancer in raw mammograms, with radiological findings, in a local context. However, their poor external performance highlights the need for substantial further work before this approach can be deemed suitable for broader diagnostic applications.",object classifi digit mammogram base radiolog find use morpholog textur descriptor artifici neural network ann breast cancer detect approach mammographi dataset high specialti region hospit oaxaca hraeo median patient age mpa 48 year interquartil rang iqr 4154 year radiolog find retrospect analyz patient underw breast biopsi previous treat extern test perform use mammogram nation cancer institut incan mpa 47 year iqr 3762 year morpholog analyz use circular descriptor  textur analyz use mean heightwidth ratio extrema descriptor  result compar cancerbenign histopatholog binarili classifi use ann f1score cohen kappa k area roc curv auc employ evalu metric wilcoxon ranksum test use statist analysi h 0 p 005 consid statist signific main result 216 raw mammogram hraeo 33 mammogram incan 9516 breast cancer 12117 benign find includ best intern test result obtain onehiddenlay ann 100 neuron achiev f1score 095 k 091 auc 0953 95 confid interv ci 0917 0977 h0 p099 howev extern test result significantli lower 038 f1score 002 k 0509 auc 95 ci 0344 0664 h0 p014 due exactli meet inclus criteria possibl demograph spectrum bia domainadapt issu signific propos morpholog  textur  descriptor show promis detect breast cancer raw mammogram radiolog find local context howev poor extern perform highlight need substanti work approach deem suitabl broader diagnost applic
cancer,"Phytochemicals, particularly polyphenols, play a crucial role in modern healthcare due to their preventive and therapeutic properties. Among these, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a potent catechin found in green tea, exhibits exceptional antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and disease-modulating effects, making it a promising candidate for managing cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders. However, its clinical translation is hindered by instability and poor bioavailability.

cancer,"Multiplexed imaging of tissues is an approach that holds promise for improving early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. Here, we investigated multiplexed histological images of paired pre- and on-treatment samples from nine patients with immunotherapy-refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with an oral HDAC inhibitor (vorinostat) combined with a PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab). Patient responses comprised of either stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD). An extensive multiplexed-image analysis pipeline involving both cell segmentation and quadrats, coupled with spatial statistics, machine learning, and deep learning was built to analyze the spatial and temporal features that predict disease progression and identify potential clinical biomarkers. Distinct spatial immune ecologies existed between SD and PD patients, and tumors from PD patients were already characterized by an immune-suppressive environment prior to treatment. Finally, the learned spatial ecologies predicted disease progression better than PD-L1 status alone, suggesting these ecologies could be used as potential companion biomarkers with PD-L1 in NSCLC. These findings will be investigated in a larger-cohort study generated from an ongoing clinical trial (NCT02638090) that includes a wider range of responses including complete and partial responders. Together, this study developed a computational infrastructure for analyzing multiplex imaging to predict immunotherapy response in NSCLC, which can potentially be generalized to any type of cancer.",multiplex imag tissu approach hold promis improv earli detect diagnosi treatment cancer investig multiplex histolog imag pair pre ontreat sampl nine patient immunotherapyrefractori nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc treat oral hdac inhibitor vorinostat combin pd1 inhibitor pembrolizumab patient respons compris either stabl diseas sd progress diseas pd extens multiplexedimag analysi pipelin involv cell segment quadrat coupl spatial statist machin learn deep learn built analyz spatial tempor featur predict diseas progress identifi potenti clinic biomark distinct spatial immun ecolog exist sd pd patient tumor pd patient alreadi character immunesuppress environ prior treatment final learn spatial ecolog predict diseas progress better pdl1 statu alon suggest ecolog could use potenti companion biomark pdl1 nsclc find investig largercohort studi gener ongo clinic trial nct02638090 includ wider rang respons includ complet partial respond togeth studi develop comput infrastructur analyz multiplex imag predict immunotherapi respons nsclc potenti gener type cancer
cancer,"PURPOSE: Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer incidence and mortality among women globally, with significant disparities in screening uptake. Technology-based tools are emerging and show the potential to promote breast cancer screening (BCS), especially for underserved populations. METHODS: This review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines and the population, intervention, comparison, and outcome framework. We reviewed 24 peer-reviewed articles from databases including ProQuest Central, Scopus, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore published before February 21, 2025, which explore the efficacy of technology use in promotion of BCS. RESULTS: The included studies used diverse technologies, including videos, mobile health, websites, and sensor-based tools. The tools covered a variety of aspects for BCS promotion, including patient education, reminders, risk assessment, and competency building. Video-based interventions showed mixed results on BCS knowledge enhancement and screening rate promotion. Culturally tailored programs were effective in increasing screening rates among immigrant populations. Short messaging service reminders and web-based decision aids were associated with higher adherence and less decisional conflict. Challenges included technical barriers, limited digital access, and low engagement, which hinder the efficacy of the tools. CONCLUSION: Technology-based interventions are promising to improve BCS uptake, especially when tailored to cultural and linguistic needs. However, addressing barriers such as digital literacy and accessibility is critical for equitable implementation. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies and diverse populations to optimize these interventions and reduce disparities in screening adherence.",purpos breast cancer lead caus cancer incid mortal among women global signific dispar screen uptak technologybas tool emerg show potenti promot breast cancer screen bc especi underserv popul method review follow prefer report item systemat review metaanalysi guidelin popul intervent comparison outcom framework review 24 peerreview articl databas includ proquest central scopu sciencedirect pubm web scienc ieee xplore publish februari 21 2025 explor efficaci technolog use promot bc result includ studi use divers technolog includ video mobil health websit sensorbas tool tool cover varieti aspect bc promot includ patient educ remind risk assess compet build videobas intervent show mix result bc knowledg enhanc screen rate promot cultur tailor program effect increas screen rate among immigr popul short messag servic remind webbas decis aid associ higher adher less decision conflict challeng includ technic barrier limit digit access low engag hinder efficaci tool conclus technologybas intervent promis improv bc uptak especi tailor cultur linguist need howev address barrier digit literaci access critic equit implement futur research focu longitudin studi divers popul optim intervent reduc dispar screen adher
cancer,"PURPOSE: The use of immunotherapy for cancer treatment is becoming increasingly prevalent, resulting in a growing number of patients experiencing immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Given the frequency of immunotherapy-related thyroid dysfunction (irTD), there is a growing demand for endocrine consultations, which has led to scheduling delays. This quality improvement project aimed to decrease the time to consultation and normalization of thyroid function tests (TFTs) in patients with irTD. METHODS: Using the Plan-Do-Study-Act framework, a clinic dedicated to the evaluation and treatment of irTD was created. The immuno-oncology toxicity (IOTOX) clinic is staffed by advanced practice providers (APPs) using standardized algorithms and physician support. RESULTS: After implementation, a prospective analysis of 46 patients from the IOTOX clinic was compared with 67 historical control patients seen before implementation. The median consultation wait time improved from 21 to 9 days (P = .01), and the median time to follow-up decreased from 180 to 58 days (P < .001). Notably, the median time to thyroid-stimulating hormone normalization was reduced from 102 to 38 days (P < .001). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that an IOTOX clinic staffed by APPs using standardized algorithms with physician support effectively improved patient access to consultation and expedited the time to normalization of TFTs. This approach can serve as a framework for addressing other irAEs at our institution and has the potential to be implemented or adapted by other institutions to improve the care of patients with irAEs.",purpos use immunotherapi cancer treatment becom increasingli preval result grow number patient experienc immunerel advers event ira given frequenc immunotherapyrel thyroid dysfunct irtd grow demand endocrin consult led schedul delay qualiti improv project aim decreas time consult normal thyroid function test tft patient irtd method use plandostudyact framework clinic dedic evalu treatment irtd creat immunooncolog toxic iotox clinic staf advanc practic provid app use standard algorithm physician support result implement prospect analysi 46 patient iotox clinic compar 67 histor control patient seen implement median consult wait time improv 21 9 day p 01 median time followup decreas 180 58 day p 001 notabl median time thyroidstimul hormon normal reduc 102 38 day p 001 conclus find suggest iotox clinic staf app use standard algorithm physician support effect improv patient access consult expedit time normal tft approach serv framework address ira institut potenti implement adapt institut improv care patient ira
cancer,"PURPOSE: The OVHIPEC-1 trial demonstrated that adding hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) to interval cytoreductive surgery (CRS) for patients with stage III epithelial ovarian cancer results in a significant increase in recurrence-free survival and overall survival. To inform policymakers about the macroeconomic budget, we conducted a budget impact analysis. METHODS: The expenditure of the Dutch health care system between 2017 and 2025 associated with the introduction of HIPEC for patients with stage III ovarian cancer eligible for interval CRS (target population) was assessed during their entire treatment course (surgical and subsequent treatment). Cost estimates are based on national registry data, national benchmark costs for hospital-related activities, list prices for drugs, therapeutic guidelines, and expert opinion. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed to test robustness of the analysis. RESULTS: The Dutch target population is expected to increase from 200 patients in 2017 to 233 patients in 2025, with 80% receiving HIPEC in 2025. Between 2017 and 2025, the impact on the annual surgical budget is euro3.5 million, of which euro1.8 million is directly attributable to HIPEC and its associated costs. When considering the cost of all ovarian cancer-related treatments, an additional euro30,898 per HIPEC patient is spent in 2025, mainly driven by prolonged recurrence-free survival resulting in extended maintenance therapy and treatment for more platinum-sensitive recurrences. This leads to an annual total treatment budget impact of euro26 million in 8 years, with euro5.7 million directly associated with HIPEC use. CONCLUSION: Within the Dutch health care system, the surgical budget impact of HIPEC is acceptable and falls within the boundaries for reimbursement of the responsible decision-making bodies. The total budget impact is mostly affected by the high costs of systemic treatment after prolonged recurrence-free survival due to HIPEC.",purpos ovhipec1 trial demonstr ad hypertherm intraperiton chemotherapi hipec interv cytoreduct surgeri cr patient stage iii epitheli ovarian cancer result signific increas recurrencefre surviv overal surviv inform policymak macroeconom budget conduct budget impact analysi method expenditur dutch health care system 2017 2025 associ introduct hipec patient stage iii ovarian cancer elig interv cr target popul assess entir treatment cours surgic subsequ treatment cost estim base nation registri data nation benchmark cost hospitalrel activ list price drug therapeut guidelin expert opinion sensit scenario analys perform test robust analysi result dutch target popul expect increas 200 patient 2017 233 patient 2025 80 receiv hipec 2025 2017 2025 impact annual surgic budget euro35 million euro18 million directli attribut hipec associ cost consid cost ovarian cancerrel treatment addit euro30898 per hipec patient spent 2025 mainli driven prolong recurrencefre surviv result extend mainten therapi treatment platinumsensit recurr lead annual total treatment budget impact euro26 million 8 year euro57 million directli associ hipec use conclus within dutch health care system surgic budget impact hipec accept fall within boundari reimburs respons decisionmak bodi total budget impact mostli affect high cost system treatment prolong recurrencefre surviv due hipec
cancer,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. While targeted therapy and immunotherapy have transformed first-line management, most patients without actionable genomic alterations (AGAs) will experience disease progression within the first year of their initial treatment. Here, we review pivotal trials, emerging strategies, challenges, and unmet needs for patients with advanced NSCLC without AGAs. Docetaxel with or without ramucirumab is the standard second-line therapy for patients who have progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Targeted therapy is only suitable for patients with specific AGAs. Understanding the hallmarks of cancer immune evasion is key to developing new strategies beyond chemoimmunotherapy. The combination of antiangiogenic agents with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has shown mixed results after progression on platinum and ICI. Bispecific antibodies, particularly ivonescimab, have shown encouraging early efficacy in this space. Artificial intelligence-driven pathomics and radiomics tools may help to refine treatment selection in the future. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy remains investigational. Patients with advanced NSCLC without AGAs who progressed after chemoimmunotherapy have limited treatment options. Novel therapies such as specific antibodies have shown promising results. Future progress will depend on the development of predictive biomarkers and understanding the mechanisms of resistance to ICIs to guide drug development.",nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc remain lead caus cancerrel death worldwid target therapi immunotherapi transform firstlin manag patient without action genom alter aga experi diseas progress within first year initi treatment review pivot trial emerg strategi challeng unmet need patient advanc nsclc without aga docetaxel without ramucirumab standard secondlin therapi patient progress platinumbas chemotherapi immunotherapi target therapi suitabl patient specif aga understand hallmark cancer immun evas key develop new strategi beyond chemoimmunotherapi combin antiangiogen agent immun checkpoint inhibitor ici shown mix result progress platinum ici bispecif antibodi particularli ivonescimab shown encourag earli efficaci space artifici intelligencedriven pathom radiom tool may help refin treatment select futur chimer antigen receptor tcell therapi remain investig patient advanc nsclc without aga progress chemoimmunotherapi limit treatment option novel therapi specif antibodi shown promis result futur progress depend develop predict biomark understand mechan resist ici guid drug develop
cancer,"PURPOSE: We assessed radiotherapy (RT) utilization and completion among pediatric patients with brain tumor treated at Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted among pediatric patients with brain tumor treated at CCHE between 2009 and 2020. Patients were categorized on the basis of demographics, tumor types, RT utilization status (prescribed, not prescribed, and did not complete), and geographic place of residence (urban v rural). RT utilization was stratified by tumor type and geographic region and compared using chi-square tests. RESULTS: Among 3,977 pediatric patients with brain tumor, 2,327 (58.5%) were prescribed RT. The highest RT utilization was observed among patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG; 98.2%) and germinoma (98.0%), while nonoptic low-grade glioma (LGG; 11.2%) and optic pathway glioma (OPG; 2.0%) had the lowest among patients prescribed RT, 2,264 (97.2%) completed treatment. The highest noncompletion was observed in patients with atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT; 6.7%) and nonoptic LGG (9.7%). Urban patients had a higher rate of RT completion (98.3%) compared with rural patients (95.9%; P < .001). CONCLUSION: RT utilization and completion varied significantly by tumor type, reflecting evidence-based treatment protocols and tumor-specific challenges. Geographic disparities in RT completion underscore systemic health care inequities in Egypt. These findings emphasize the need for targeted interventions, including decentralized radiotherapy delivery models and public health strategies, to improve access to and adherence to radiotherapy among underserved populations.",purpos assess radiotherapi rt util complet among pediatr patient brain tumor treat children cancer hospit egypt cche method retrospect analysi conduct among pediatr patient brain tumor treat cche 2009 2020 patient categor basi demograph tumor type rt util statu prescrib prescrib complet geograph place resid urban v rural rt util stratifi tumor type geograph region compar use chisquar test result among 3977 pediatr patient brain tumor 2327 585 prescrib rt highest rt util observ among patient diffus intrins pontin glioma dipg 982 germinoma 980 nonopt lowgrad glioma lgg 112 optic pathway glioma opg 20 lowest among patient prescrib rt 2264 972 complet treatment highest noncomplet observ patient atyp teratoid rhabdoid tumor atrt 67 nonopt lgg 97 urban patient higher rate rt complet 983 compar rural patient 959 p 001 conclus rt util complet vari significantli tumor type reflect evidencebas treatment protocol tumorspecif challeng geograph dispar rt complet underscor system health care inequ egypt find emphas need target intervent includ decentr radiotherapi deliveri model public health strategi improv access adher radiotherapi among underserv popul
cancer,"PURPOSE: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy characterized by poor prognosis. The ADRIATIC trial demonstrated significant survival benefits with durvalumab as maintenance therapy for limited-stage SCLC (LS-SCLC). However, the high cost of durvalumab necessitates an evaluation of its cost-effectiveness. METHODS: A partitioned survival model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of durvalumab consolidation therapy compared with the standard of care (SOC). The model comprised three mutually exclusive health states: progression-free survival (PFS), progression of disease (POD)/metastasis, and death. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000 in US dollars (USD)/QALY. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Analysis for POD was also stratified into intrathoracic, extrathoracic, and CNS. RESULTS: Durvalumab improved overall survival (OS) to 66.1 months and PFS to 40.2 months, compared with 57.8 and 31.8 months for SOC, respectively. The total cost of durvalumab was $163,722 USD versus $25,816 USD for placebo, resulting in an incremental cost of $137,905 USD. Durvalumab provided an incremental QALY gain of 0.36 years, yielding an ICER of $383,069 USD/QALY, exceeding WTP. On stratification, durvalumab in patients with extrathoracic progression nearly met WTP (ICER, $151,137 USD). CONCLUSION: Durvalumab remains cost-prohibitive for the overall cohort, exceeding acceptable thresholds despite favorable outcomes. Subgroup analysis, however, indicates that selective use in patients with extrathoracic progression may enhance cost-effectiveness. Overcoming economic barriers will be essential for the sustainable integration of immunotherapy into routine care.",purpos small cell lung cancer sclc aggress neuroendocrin malign character poor prognosi adriat trial demonstr signific surviv benefit durvalumab mainten therapi limitedstag sclc lssclc howev high cost durvalumab necessit evalu costeffect method partit surviv model develop assess costeffect durvalumab consolid therapi compar standard care soc model compris three mutual exclus health state progressionfre surviv pf progress diseas podmetastasi death increment costeffect ratio icer calcul cost per qualityadjust life year qali gain willingnesstopay wtp threshold 150000 us dollar usdqali oneway probabilist sensit analys conduct analysi pod also stratifi intrathorac extrathorac cn result durvalumab improv overal surviv os 661 month pf 402 month compar 578 318 month soc respect total cost durvalumab 163722 usd versu 25816 usd placebo result increment cost 137905 usd durvalumab provid increment qali gain 036 year yield icer 383069 usdqali exceed wtp stratif durvalumab patient extrathorac progress nearli met wtp icer 151137 usd conclus durvalumab remain costprohibit overal cohort exceed accept threshold despit favor outcom subgroup analysi howev indic select use patient extrathorac progress may enhanc costeffect overcom econom barrier essenti sustain integr immunotherapi routin care
cancer,"PURPOSE: Cure of metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer (mGC/GEJC) with systemic chemotherapy alone is extremely rare. Although long-term follow-up from previous phase III studies suggest that durable complete response (CR) may occur in a limited number of patients with first-line treatment, clinical characteristics of such cases remain poorly characterized. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients with mGC/GEJC who received systemic chemotherapy at our institute between April 2013 and March 2022. Patients were defined as having a potential cure if they demonstrated a clinical or pathologic CR, maintained progression-free survival for more than 3 years from the treatment initiation, and remained free from disease progression for at least 1 year after treatment discontinuation. Clinicopathologic features, treatment regimens, and biomarker profiles, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), mismatch repair (MMR), programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), and claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2), were analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients met the criteria for potential cure. The median age was 67 years and 72.5% of the patients were male and had single-organ metastasis. Among patients with assessable biomarker status, the proportions of positive cases were 23.5% for HER2 (n = 51), 23.3% for deficient MMR (dMMR; n = 43), 16.0% for CLDN18.2 (n = 25), and 30.0% for PD-L1 Combined Positive Score (CPS) >/=10 (n = 30). First-line therapy led to potential cure in 52.9% of patients. Ten patients were potentially cured with cytotoxic chemotherapy alone, while 23 and 26 patients received molecular targeted agents or immunotherapy, respectively. CONCLUSION: The introduction of molecular targeted agents and immunotherapy has expanded the chance of potential cure. The enrichment of dMMR, HER2-positive, and CPS-high tumors among potentially cured cases highlights the urgent need to develop effective therapies for those lacking actionable biomarkers.",purpos cure metastat gastric gastroesophag junction cancer mgcgejc system chemotherapi alon extrem rare although longterm followup previou phase iii studi suggest durabl complet respons cr may occur limit number patient firstlin treatment clinic characterist case remain poorli character materi method retrospect review medic record patient mgcgejc receiv system chemotherapi institut april 2013 march 2022 patient defin potenti cure demonstr clinic patholog cr maintain progressionfre surviv 3 year treatment initi remain free diseas progress least 1 year treatment discontinu clinicopatholog featur treatment regimen biomark profil includ human epiderm growth factor receptor 2 her2 mismatch repair mmr program death ligand1 pdl1 claudin 182 cldn182 analyz result fiftyon patient met criteria potenti cure median age 67 year 725 patient male singleorgan metastasi among patient assess biomark statu proport posit case 235 her2 n 51 233 defici mmr dmmr n 43 160 cldn182 n 25 300 pdl1 combin posit score cp 10 n 30 firstlin therapi led potenti cure 529 patient ten patient potenti cure cytotox chemotherapi alon 23 26 patient receiv molecular target agent immunotherapi respect conclus introduct molecular target agent immunotherapi expand chanc potenti cure enrich dmmr her2posit cpshigh tumor among potenti cure case highlight urgent need develop effect therapi lack action biomark
cancer,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of upper limb lymphedema and dysfunction caused by axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in breast cancer patients is high, and there is a lack of effective prevention strategies. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical study to compare the effects of ALND with or without axillary vein tributary preservation on the incidence of postoperative upper limb edema and dysfunction in breast cancer patients. Patients aged 18-69 years with stage II-III breast cancer requiring ALND were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative short-term upper limb lymphedema and dysfunction on the affected side. All randomly allocated patients were included in the final follow-up and analysis. FINDINGS: From January 3rd, 2022 to April 1st, 2024, 258 female patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group(n = 87) or the control group (n = 171). The median age was 54 years in the intervention group and 53 years in the control group. The median follow-up was 15.1 months in the intervention group and 13.4 months in the control group. The 6-month and 12-month incidences of lymphedema in the intervention group were significantly lower than those in the control group (6-month: 0% vs. 10.78%, ARR (absolute risk reduction) 10.78%, P<0.001; OR (odds ratio) 0.143, 95% CI [0.065, 0.311]. 12-month: 2.38% vs. 16.18%, ARR 13.8%, P<0.001; OR 0.289, 95% CI [0.188, 0.446]). According to the results of the general linear model analysis, the mean DASH (disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand) scores in the intervention group were lower than those in the control group (F = 10.167, P = 0.002). The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that preserving axillary vein tributaries during ALND was a protective factor for postoperative upper limb edema, whereas stage III, extensive lymphadenectomy (level 2/3), radiotherapy and postoperative infection were risk factors. No serious complications or deaths related to the operation occurred. INTERPRETATION: ALND with axillary vein tributary preservation is beneficial for reducing the short-term incidence of postoperative upper limb edema and dysfunction, which is worth promoting in breast cancer patients who need ALND.",background incid upper limb lymphedema dysfunct caus axillari lymph node dissect alnd breast cancer patient high lack effect prevent strategi method conduct multicent prospect doubleblind random control clinic studi compar effect alnd without axillari vein tributari preserv incid postop upper limb edema dysfunct breast cancer patient patient age 1869 year stage iiiii breast cancer requir alnd enrol primari endpoint incid postop shortterm upper limb lymphedema dysfunct affect side randomli alloc patient includ final followup analysi find januari 3rd 2022 april 1st 2024 258 femal patient randomli assign intervent groupn 87 control group n 171 median age 54 year intervent group 53 year control group median followup 151 month intervent group 134 month control group 6month 12month incid lymphedema intervent group significantli lower control group 6month 0 vs 1078 arr absolut risk reduct 1078 p0001 odd ratio 0143 95 ci 0065 0311 12month 238 vs 1618 arr 138 p0001 0289 95 ci 0188 0446 accord result gener linear model analysi mean dash disabl arm shoulder hand score intervent group lower control group f 10167 p 0002 result multivari logist regress analysi reveal preserv axillari vein tributari alnd protect factor postop upper limb edema wherea stage iii extens lymphadenectomi level 23 radiotherapi postop infect risk factor seriou complic death relat oper occur interpret alnd axillari vein tributari preserv benefici reduc shortterm incid postop upper limb edema dysfunct worth promot breast cancer patient need alnd
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Image-guided thermal ablation (IGTA) has increasingly been used for stage IA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet long-term outcomes comparing IGTA with sublobar resection (SLR) without surgical contraindications remain unclear. Identifying patients who may benefit from ablation is also technically challenging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 2,145 patients treated with IGTA or SLR from 2012 to 2023 were analyzed. Propensity score matching was performed. Progression-free survival (PFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A deep learning model based on pre-treatment computed tomography images was developed to predict disease-free survival after IGTA and identify patients most appropriate for ablation. RESULTS: After matching, the median follow-up was 39.3 months for the SLR group and 46.7 months for the IGTA group. No significant differences were observed in PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-4.89; P = 0.120) or CSS (HR, 3.09; 95% CI, 0.87-11.04; P = 0.082). The area under the curve (AUC) of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model was 0.826 and 0.814 for the training and external validation cohorts, respectively. Higher ViT scores predicted worse survival (HR, 8.61; P < 0.001). The Multimodal XGBoost model further improved the performance. CONCLUSION: In this study, long-term outcomes after IGTA were not significantly different from those after SLR in patients with stage IA NSCLC. The ViT model accurately predicted outcomes after ablation. These results indicate that ablation may be a feasible alternative to conventional surgery in appropriately selected patients.",background imageguid thermal ablat igta increasingli use stage ia nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc yet longterm outcom compar igta sublobar resect slr without surgic contraind remain unclear identifi patient may benefit ablat also technic challeng materi method total 2145 patient treat igta slr 2012 2023 analyz propens score match perform progressionfre surviv pf cancerspecif surviv css rate estim use kaplanmei method deep learn model base pretreat comput tomographi imag develop predict diseasefre surviv igta identifi patient appropri ablat result match median followup 393 month slr group 467 month igta group signific differ observ pf hazard ratio hr 202 95 confid interv ci 083489 p 0120 css hr 309 95 ci 0871104 p 0082 area curv auc vision transform vit model 0826 0814 train extern valid cohort respect higher vit score predict wors surviv hr 861 p 0001 multimod xgboost model improv perform conclus studi longterm outcom igta significantli differ slr patient stage ia nsclc vit model accur predict outcom ablat result indic ablat may feasibl altern convent surgeri appropri select patient
cancer,"Cervical cancer remains the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide. Early detection of cervical lesions in cytology images can prevent disease progression, but current deep learning methods for cell- or patch-level analysis in whole slide images (WSI) face significant challenges due to limited, noisy, or incomplete annotations. To address these limitations, weakly supervised learning methods, particularly multiple instance learning (MIL), have been explored. However, traditional MIL methods often suffer from label noise, leading to inaccurate feature extraction, which in turn restricts their robustness and generalization. In this paper, we propose Self-Correcting Instance Learning (SCIL), a novel two-stage instance-based MIL framework designed to enhance instance-level cervical lesion detection under bag-level supervision. SCIL incorporates a weakly supervised self-correction mechanism within a teacher-student architecture to mitigate the effects of noisy pseudo labels. This process involves a contrastive dynamic weighting strategy to adjust instance-level loss and enhance feature representation in stage one, followed by an uncertainty-based self-correction strategy in stage two to retain only high-confidence data with reassigned labels.

This study aims to compare three reconstruction methods-uncut Roux-en-Y (R-Y) with Billroth-II (B-II) and B-II Braun-in terms of bile reflux, other endoscopic findings, and QOL. METHODS: The study was a multi-center, open-label, phase 3 randomized controlled trial conducted across four hospitals. A total of 189 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the B-II, B-II Braun, or uncut R-Y groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. The primary endpoint was the incidence of bile reflux at 3 months postoperatively, evaluated via endoscopic examination. Secondary endpoints included additional endoscopic findings and QOL assessments using questionnaires survey. RESULTS: The operation time was significantly longer in the uncut R-Y group compared to the other groups. There were no significant differences in short-term outcomes among the three groups. The incidence of bile reflux at 3 months was significantly lower in the uncut R-Y group (6.8%) compared to the B-II (77.6%) and B-II Braun (63.6%) groups (p < 0.001). This superiority was sustained at 12 months (10.5% vs. 86.0% vs. 67.9%, respectively; p < 0.001). The uncut R-Y group also exhibited relatively lower rates of alkaline reflux gastritis and epigastric soreness. Dietary intake increased in all three groups from 3 to 12 months postoperatively, with no significant differences between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Uncut R-Y is superior to B-II and B-II Braun in reducing bile reflux and related symptoms after distal gastrectomy. These findings support the adoption of uncut R-Y as a preferred reconstruction method for long-term QOL improvement in gastric cancer patients.

cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical and oncologic outcomes of minimal access (endoscopic- or robotic-assisted) nipple-sparing mastectomy (MA-NSM) and conventional NSM (C-NSM). BACKGROUND: MA-NSM has been increasingly applied in the treatment of patients with breast cancer. However, high-quality long-term follow-up data remains lacking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database was conducted from single institute to compare the oncologic outcome of MA-NSM versus C-NSM. The clinical results and oncologic outcome (margin involvement rate, local recurrence and overall survival) were compared. To prevent bias, a cohort study approach was conducted with propensity score matching (PSM) method. RESULTS: During study, 1108 NSM procedures were performed. After inclusion and exclusion criteria, 905 NSM procedures were enrolled. These included 317 MA-NSM (245 endoscopic-assisted NSM and 72 robotic-assisted NSM), and 588 C-NSM cases. After PSM, there were 289 MA-NSM and 289 C-NSM cases compared. There were fewer major (Clavien-Dindo grade II and above) complications in MA-NSM compared with C-NSM (4.1% versus 10.7%, p = 0.03). The margin involvement rate of C-NSM was 3.5% versus 3.8% for MA-NSM (p>0.99). The follow-up duration of C-NSM patients was longer at 75.3 +/- 46 months compared to 66.1 +/- 39.1 months for MA-NSM patients. In Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis, there was no difference in recurrence-free survival (p = 0.17), however metastasis-free (p = 0.048), disease-free (p = 0.048) and overall survival curves (p = 0.025) showed marginally significant difference between C-NSM and MA-NSM after PSM. CONCLUSION: Our current study demonstrates that MA-NSM is oncologically safe, with comparable results in margin involvement, locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis and overall survival compared to C-NSM.",object compar clinic oncolog outcom minim access endoscop roboticassist nipplespar mastectomi mansm convent nsm cnsm background mansm increasingli appli treatment patient breast cancer howev highqual longterm followup data remain lack materi method retrospect analysi prospect collect databas conduct singl institut compar oncolog outcom mansm versu cnsm clinic result oncolog outcom margin involv rate local recurr overal surviv compar prevent bia cohort studi approach conduct propens score match psm method result studi 1108 nsm procedur perform inclus exclus criteria 905 nsm procedur enrol includ 317 mansm 245 endoscopicassist nsm 72 roboticassist nsm 588 cnsm case psm 289 mansm 289 cnsm case compar fewer major claviendindo grade ii complic mansm compar cnsm 41 versu 107 p 003 margin involv rate cnsm 35 versu 38 mansm p099 followup durat cnsm patient longer 753 46 month compar 661 391 month mansm patient kaplanmei surviv curv analysi differ recurrencefre surviv p 017 howev metastasisfre p 0048 diseasefre p 0048 overal surviv curv p 0025 show margin signific differ cnsm mansm psm conclus current studi demonstr mansm oncolog safe compar result margin involv locoregion recurr distant metastasi overal surviv compar cnsm
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Although cancer immunotherapy has significantly improved the clinical outcomes of tumors, the heterogeneity of individual responses remains a major challenge. The gut microbiota profoundly influences the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) through mechanisms such as metabolite secretion, immune cell regulation, and tumor microenvironment remodeling. The regulatory roles of specific microbiota features (such as Ruminococcus and Bifidobacterium) and metabolites (such as L-selenomethionine) have been confirmed. With the rapid development of research, the literature in this field has grown explosively, and traditional review methods are difficult to systematically analyze its knowledge structure, hotspots evolution, and interdisciplinary trends. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to map the knowledge landscape of gut microbiota in cancer immunotherapy using bibliometrics, to identify research trends, key contributors, and emerging hotspots. METHODS: Literature published from 1 January 2001, to 7 July 2025 was retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). After strict screening, 2,669 publications were included for bibliometric analysis using CiteSpace. Key analytical parameters were set as follows: time slicing =1 year, top N =50 per slice, pathfinder pruning. The analysis encompassed temporal publication trends, collaboration networks (countries/institutions/authors), keyword co-occurrence, clustering, and burst detection. RESULTS: The research showed a three-stage growth pattern of ""germination-development-explosion,"" peaking at 525 articles in 2024. China (988 articles) and the United States (762 articles) were the high-yield countries; England had the highest centrality (0.30) and was the global cooperation hub. The University of Texas System (149 articles), Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) (124 articles), and MD Anderson Cancer Center (123 articles) are high-yield institutions; the University of California System has the highest centrality (0.19). The top 3 authors in terms of publication volume were Zitvogel, Laurence (50 articles), Routy, Bertrand (47 articles), and Wargo, Jennifer A (39 articles). Authors with high centrality (0.03) include Kroemer, Guido; Trinchieri, Giorgio; Ascierto, Paolo Antonio; and Marincola, Francesco M. The most frequent keywords were gut microbiota (frequency = 690), immunotherapy (509), and colorectal cancer (358). Keywords with the highest centrality included immunotherapy (centrality = 0.30), t cells (0.22), and gut microbiota (0.20). The strongest emerging keywords were microsatellite instability (burst strength = 10.09), health (9.85), and diversity (9.65). Keyword cluster analysis (Modularity Q = 0.4276, Silhouette = 0.6724) revealed five major research directions: immune checkpoint inhibitor, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, efficacy, tumor microenvironment. CONCLUSION: This study systematically delineated a ""microbiota-immunity-tumor"" triangular knowledge framework that currently underpins the field, highlighting its maturation through bibliometric evidence. In the future, it is critical to integrate cross-scale mechanism exploration, standardized clinical translation pathways, and a global collaboration network to promote breakthroughs in personalized immunotherapy strategies, with direct relevance for clinical and perioperative care in oncology.",background although cancer immunotherapi significantli improv clinic outcom tumor heterogen individu respons remain major challeng gut microbiota profoundli influenc efficaci immun checkpoint inhibitor ici mechan metabolit secret immun cell regul tumor microenviron remodel regulatori role specif microbiota featur ruminococcu bifidobacterium metabolit lselenomethionin confirm rapid develop research literatur field grown explos tradit review method difficult systemat analyz knowledg structur hotspot evolut interdisciplinari trend object studi aim map knowledg landscap gut microbiota cancer immunotherapi use bibliometr identifi research trend key contributor emerg hotspot method literatur publish 1 januari 2001 7 juli 2025 retriev web scienc core collect woscc strict screen 2669 public includ bibliometr analysi use citespac key analyt paramet set follow time slice 1 year top n 50 per slice pathfind prune analysi encompass tempor public trend collabor network countriesinstitutionsauthor keyword cooccurr cluster burst detect result research show threestag growth pattern germinationdevelopmentexplos peak 525 articl 2024 china 988 articl unit state 762 articl highyield countri england highest central 030 global cooper hub univers texa system 149 articl institut nation de la sant et de la recherch medical inserm 124 articl md anderson cancer center 123 articl highyield institut univers california system highest central 019 top 3 author term public volum zitvogel laurenc 50 articl routi bertrand 47 articl wargo jennif 39 articl author high central 003 includ kroemer guido trinchieri giorgio ascierto paolo antonio marincola francesco frequent keyword gut microbiota frequenc 690 immunotherapi 509 colorect cancer 358 keyword highest central includ immunotherapi central 030 cell 022 gut microbiota 020 strongest emerg keyword microsatellit instabl burst strength 1009 health 985 divers 965 keyword cluster analysi modular q 04276 silhouett 06724 reveal five major research direct immun checkpoint inhibitor breast cancer colorect cancer efficaci tumor microenviron conclus studi systemat delin microbiotaimmunitytumor triangular knowledg framework current underpin field highlight matur bibliometr evid futur critic integr crossscal mechan explor standard clinic translat pathway global collabor network promot breakthrough person immunotherapi strategi direct relev clinic periop care oncolog
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Individualized postoperative management of colorectal ovarian metastases demands precision medicine tools, yet current approaches lack consideration of prognostic heterogeneity and targeted therapy benefit guidance and suffer from high costs and long turnaround times of genetic testing. METHODS: In this retrospective, prospective multicohort study, we developed and validated an interpretable transformer-based transfer learning model to predict patient prognosis, targeted therapy benefits and molecular mutations by integrating digital pathology with RNA data. The performance of the model was assessed with the AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV. RESULTS: The model accurately predicted peritoneal recurrence, with AUCs of 0.90, 0.74, and 0.83 across patient cohorts. It also achieved precise prognostic stratification for peritoneal recurrence-free survival in the training (HR = 107.22, 95% CI 24.18-475.52; p<0.001), external test (HR = 4.97, 95% CI 1.16-21.37; p = 0.03), and prospective test (HR = 10.53, 95% CI 2.02-54.94; p = 0.01) sets. The model revealed a significant association between prognostic stratification and tumor microenvironment heterogeneity (p < 0.05), thereby enhancing its biological interpretability. Further analysis revealed that only patients classified as high risk with BRAF/RAS mutations could benefit from the addition of targeted therapy to adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.18-0.79; p = 0.007). Moreover, the model predicted BRAF/RAS mutations with AUCs of 0.96/0.94 in the training set, maintaining cross-cohort generalizability with AUCs of 0.64-0.83. CONCLUSIONS: This pathobiology-based deep learning model can robustly detect prognosis and mutation and identify targeted therapy beneficiaries, serving as a potential precision tool in clinical decision-making for the management of colorectal ovarian metastases.",background individu postop manag colorect ovarian metastas demand precis medicin tool yet current approach lack consider prognost heterogen target therapi benefit guidanc suffer high cost long turnaround time genet test method retrospect prospect multicohort studi develop valid interpret transformerbas transfer learn model predict patient prognosi target therapi benefit molecular mutat integr digit patholog rna data perform model assess auc accuraci sensit specif ppv npv result model accur predict periton recurr auc 090 074 083 across patient cohort also achiev precis prognost stratif periton recurrencefre surviv train hr 10722 95 ci 241847552 p0001 extern test hr 497 95 ci 1162137 p 003 prospect test hr 1053 95 ci 2025494 p 001 set model reveal signific associ prognost stratif tumor microenviron heterogen p 005 therebi enhanc biolog interpret analysi reveal patient classifi high risk brafra mutat could benefit addit target therapi adjuv chemotherapi hr 038 95 ci 018079 p 0007 moreov model predict brafra mutat auc 096094 train set maintain crosscohort generaliz auc 064083 conclus pathobiologybas deep learn model robustli detect prognosi mutat identifi target therapi beneficiari serv potenti precis tool clinic decisionmak manag colorect ovarian metastas
cancer,"BACKGROUND: High tumor recurrence after surgery remains a significant challenge in managing prostate cancer (PCa). We aimed to develop and validate a 2.5D deep learning model based on a transformer architecture utilizing T2WI, ADC, DWI, and CE-T1WI images for the preoperative prediction of biochemical recurrence (BCR) in PCa, and to further investigate its capability for risk stratification. METHODS: A total of 923 PCa patients (10 153 images) who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) at five tertiary medical centers were retrospectively enrolled, with follow-up completed by September 2024. Among the five evaluated classifiers, ResNet18 was selected as the best-performing backbone for feature extraction. A Transformer-based deep learning (DL) model was developed using preoperative mpMRI data, and a deep learning fusion (DLF) model was constructed by integrating DL scores with weighted clinical variables, and its performance was compared with the traditional clinical risk score (CAPRA), a clinical model (Clinical), an ensemble learning model (Ensemble), and a multiple instance learning model (MIL). Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Model comparisons were conducted using the DeLong test, decision curve analysis (DCA) and calibration curves were used to assess the clinical utility and calibration of the models. Furthermore, Grad-CAM was used to visualize model attention and improve interpretability. RESULTS: The DLF model exhibited excellent performance in both the validation and test sets. It achieved an AUC of 0.938 (95% CI: 0.884-0.992) in the internal validation cohort and an AUC of 0.935 (95% CI: 0.900-0.969) in the external test cohort. The DLF model significantly outperformed all unimodal models (P < 0.05, DeLong test), improving AUC by 0.058-0.253 over the clinical model and 0.189-0.299 over CAPRA. Furthermore, the DLF model enabled effective risk stratification, with high-risk patients showing significantly poorer prognostic outcomes than low-risk patients (P < 0.05). It also demonstrated significant predictive power for recurrence events at multiple time points. Specifically, as measured by time-dependent AUC values, the model's predictive performance at 1, 2, and 3 years was 0.866 (95% CI: 0.810-0.921), 0.867 (95% CI: 0.816-0.918), and 0.879 (95% CI: 0.832-0.926), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The stacked DLF model demonstrated the capability to predict early postoperative recurrence in patients with PCa and effectively identify high-risk cases, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool for optimizing treatment strategies and postoperative surveillance.",background high tumor recurr surgeri remain signific challeng manag prostat cancer pca aim develop valid 25d deep learn model base transform architectur util t2wi adc dwi cet1wi imag preoper predict biochem recurr bcr pca investig capabl risk stratif method total 923 pca patient 10 153 imag underw radic prostatectomi rp five tertiari medic center retrospect enrol followup complet septemb 2024 among five evalu classifi resnet18 select bestperform backbon featur extract transformerbas deep learn dl model develop use preoper mpmri data deep learn fusion dlf model construct integr dl score weight clinic variabl perform compar tradit clinic risk score capra clinic model clinic ensembl learn model ensembl multipl instanc learn model mil model perform evalu use receiv oper characterist roc curv model comparison conduct use delong test decis curv analysi dca calibr curv use assess clinic util calibr model furthermor gradcam use visual model attent improv interpret result dlf model exhibit excel perform valid test set achiev auc 0938 95 ci 08840992 intern valid cohort auc 0935 95 ci 09000969 extern test cohort dlf model significantli outperform unimod model p 005 delong test improv auc 00580253 clinic model 01890299 capra furthermor dlf model enabl effect risk stratif highrisk patient show significantli poorer prognost outcom lowrisk patient p 005 also demonstr signific predict power recurr event multipl time point specif measur timedepend auc valu model predict perform 1 2 3 year 0866 95 ci 08100921 0867 95 ci 08160918 0879 95 ci 08320926 respect conclus stack dlf model demonstr capabl predict earli postop recurr patient pca effect identifi highrisk case highlight potenti valuabl tool optim treatment strategi postop surveil
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Patients with benign gallbladder diseases (BGBD) in China are characterized by prolonged illness duration, recurrent acute inflammation and poor medical compliance, all increase difficulty of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Complications including biliary injury, residual stones and intraoperative iatrogenic rupture (IIR) of the gallbladder wall (GBW) resulting in incidental gallbladder cancer (IGBC) exposure all warrant vigilance. This study aims to evaluate whether intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) could enhance safety of crucial steps of LC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients enrolled in this single-center randomized controlled trial were initially diagnosed with BGBD and randomly assigned to two groups at a 1:1 ratio, based on whether IOUS scanning was conducted during LC. The primary aim was to assess whether IOUS could: (1) Identify adherent gastrointestinal tracts within the surgical field; (2) diagnose cystic duct (CD) stones; and (3) guide the selection of appropriate dissection approaches of GBW to prevent IIR according to the modified Gallbladder Reporting and Data System (GB-RADS). RESULTS: A total of 152 patients were enrolled in this trial. IOUS helped in differentiating CD stones and adhered gastrointestinal tissues within the surgical area. IOUS effectively reduced IIR (3.95% vs. 17.11%, p = 0.017) because it clearly demonstrated morphology of GBW layers under different levels of inflammation. Additionally, among patients classified as GB-RADS 2B and 2C, the proportion of cases with atypical hyperplasia was notably higher than those with GB-RADS 2A and 1 (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: IOUS plays a pivotal role in enhancing the safety of critical steps during LC surgeries for selected complex cases. Integrating IOUS with GB-RADS is of great value in guiding the selection of safe GBW approaches and preventing IIR in cases with canceration risk.",background patient benign gallbladd diseas bgbd china character prolong ill durat recurr acut inflamm poor medic complianc increas difficulti laparoscop cholecystectomi lc complic includ biliari injuri residu stone intraop iatrogen ruptur iir gallbladd wall gbw result incident gallbladd cancer igbc exposur warrant vigil studi aim evalu whether intraop ultrasound iou could enhanc safeti crucial step lc materi method patient enrol singlecent random control trial initi diagnos bgbd randomli assign two group 11 ratio base whether iou scan conduct lc primari aim assess whether iou could 1 identifi adher gastrointestin tract within surgic field 2 diagnos cystic duct cd stone 3 guid select appropri dissect approach gbw prevent iir accord modifi gallbladd report data system gbrad result total 152 patient enrol trial iou help differenti cd stone adher gastrointestin tissu within surgic area iou effect reduc iir 395 vs 1711 p 0017 clearli demonstr morpholog gbw layer differ level inflamm addit among patient classifi gbrad 2b 2c proport case atyp hyperplasia notabl higher gbrad 2a 1 p 0002 conclus iou play pivot role enhanc safeti critic step lc surgeri select complex case integr iou gbrad great valu guid select safe gbw approach prevent iir case cancer risk
cancer,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex ecosystem comprising tumor cells and their surrounding components, such as stromal cells, extracellular matrix, blood vessels, and signaling molecules. It functions as the ""soil"" that sustains tumor survival and progression, critically influencing tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. As a key component of the TME, the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) refers specifically to the interactive network between tumor cells and the immune system. This interplay dictates whether tumors are recognized and eliminated by immune surveillance or succeed in evading immune detection.The gastrointestinal microecology (GM) system encompasses the gut microbiota and their respective habitats. Gut microbiota influence tumor progression through immune regulation, metabolic modulation, and genotoxic effects, thereby shaping therapeutic responses. Meanwhile, tumor cells employ diverse metabolic pathways to meet heightened bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands and to mitigate oxidative stress-processes essential for their proliferation and survival. These metabolic adaptations significantly shape TME characteristics, including nutrient availability, hypoxia, and the induction of immunosuppression.This review summarizes the roles of the immune microenvironment, metabolic microenvironment, and gut microbiota in the initiation, progression, and treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). It further illustrates how these three components interact to collectively regulate PCa development and therapeutic outcomes. By integrating recent advances in these areas, we aim to provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of PCa pathogenesis and to inform comprehensive clinical strategies.",tumor microenviron tme complex ecosystem compris tumor cell surround compon stromal cell extracellular matrix blood vessel signal molecul function soil sustain tumor surviv progress critic influenc tumor growth invas metastasi drug resist key compon tme tumor immun microenviron time refer specif interact network tumor cell immun system interplay dictat whether tumor recogn elimin immun surveil succeed evad immun detectionth gastrointestin microecolog gm system encompass gut microbiota respect habitat gut microbiota influenc tumor progress immun regul metabol modul genotox effect therebi shape therapeut respons meanwhil tumor cell employ divers metabol pathway meet heighten bioenerget biosynthet demand mitig oxid stressprocess essenti prolifer surviv metabol adapt significantli shape tme characterist includ nutrient avail hypoxia induct immunosuppressionthi review summar role immun microenviron metabol microenviron gut microbiota initi progress treatment prostat cancer pca illustr three compon interact collect regul pca develop therapeut outcom integr recent advanc area aim provid new insight molecular mechan pca pathogenesi inform comprehens clinic strategi
cancer,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with extensive peripancreatic vessel involvement is classified as locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). For this group of patients, the current standard of care does not include considering a potentially curative oncologic resection. However, recent advances in multiagent chemotherapy and surgical techniques are challenging this paradigm. Moreover, the current determination of anatomic resectability is vague and unreliable. Here we propose a definition of local resectability, based on pre- and intra-operative assessment. This anatomic definition of resectability assumes careful patient selection based on tumor biology and patient condition. The pre-operative evaluation of vascular anatomy and tumor involvement is conducted using 3D-rendering of pancreas-protocol computed tomography. Identifying a disease-free arterial or venous segment above and below the tumor involvement (""suitable target"") is the single critical factor that determines anatomic resectability. Intraoperative isolation of these target vessels confirms the feasibility of vascular reconstruction before resection. This approach, which focuses on identifying target vessels rather than circumferential involvement, offers a more straightforward and clinically relevant method for assessing surgical eligibility in LAPC patients at centers of excellence. In summary, reconstructability-based on surgical expertise and guided by tumor biology-now defines the modern paradigm of resectability in LAPC.",pancreat ductal adenocarcinoma pdac extens peripancreat vessel involv classifi local advanc pancreat cancer lapc group patient current standard care includ consid potenti cur oncolog resect howev recent advanc multiag chemotherapi surgic techniqu challeng paradigm moreov current determin anatom resect vagu unreli propos definit local resect base pre intraop assess anatom definit resect assum care patient select base tumor biolog patient condit preoper evalu vascular anatomi tumor involv conduct use 3drender pancreasprotocol comput tomographi identifi diseasefre arteri venou segment tumor involv suitabl target singl critic factor determin anatom resect intraop isol target vessel confirm feasibl vascular reconstruct resect approach focus identifi target vessel rather circumferenti involv offer straightforward clinic relev method assess surgic elig lapc patient center excel summari reconstructabilitybas surgic expertis guid tumor biologynow defin modern paradigm resect lapc
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance is implicated in breast carcinogenesis, but the comparative performance of different surrogate indices in associating with breast cancer risk among perimenopausal and postmenopausal women remains unclear. METHODS: We analyzed data from 7,713 peri-/postmenopausal women from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2020). Four insulin resistance indices, namely, the triglyceride-glucose index (TyG), triglyceride-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-C), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR), were assessed. Boruta algorithm-based feature selection preceded weighted multivariate logistic regression, estimating associations with prevalent self‑reported breast cancer. Restricted cubic spline method was used to test for nonlinearity. Mediation analysis explored mechanisms, whereas Cox regression was used to evaluate mortality. RESULTS: The TyG index was associated with higher odds of prevalent breast cancer, both as a continuous variable (OR = 1.52; 95% CI: 1.14-2.04; P = 0.005) and in its highest quartile (OR = 2.45; 95% CI: 1.18-5.07; P = 0.017, P for trend = 0.009),with a roughly linear pattern. HOMA-IR showed a weaker, nonlinear association concentrated only in the highest quartile (OR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.29-4.69; P = 0.007; P for trend = 0.013). TG/HDL-C and METS-IR were not consistently related. Uric acid to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (UHR, 33.84%) and the neutrophil-to-platelet ratio (NPR, 7.11%) partially mediated the effect of TyG (P < 0.05). Cox regression showed that the TyG index increased all-cause (HR = 1.67; 95% CI: 1.49-1.86; P < 0.001) and cancer mortality (HR = 1.57; 95% CI: 1.27-1.93; P < 0.001), but not among the subgroup of women with prevalent breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: In a nationally representative sample of peri-/postmenopausal women, TyG was associated with higher odds of prevalent breast cancer. Oxidative stress (UHR) and inflammation (NPR) may partially explain this relationship.",background insulin resist implic breast carcinogenesi compar perform differ surrog indic associ breast cancer risk among perimenopaus postmenopaus women remain unclear method analyz data 7713 peripostmenopaus women nation health nutrit examin survey 19992020 four insulin resist indic name triglycerideglucos index tyg triglyceridetohighdens lipoprotein cholesterol ratio tghdlc homeostasi model assess insulin resist homair metabol score insulin resist metsir assess boruta algorithmbas featur select preced weight multivari logist regress estim associ preval self‑report breast cancer restrict cubic spline method use test nonlinear mediat analysi explor mechan wherea cox regress use evalu mortal result tyg index associ higher odd preval breast cancer continu variabl 152 95 ci 114204 p 0005 highest quartil 245 95 ci 118507 p 0017 p trend 0009with roughli linear pattern homair show weaker nonlinear associ concentr highest quartil 246 95 ci 129469 p 0007 p trend 0013 tghdlc metsir consist relat uric acid highdens lipoprotein cholesterol uhr 3384 neutrophiltoplatelet ratio npr 711 partial mediat effect tyg p 005 cox regress show tyg index increas allcaus hr 167 95 ci 149186 p 0001 cancer mortal hr 157 95 ci 127193 p 0001 among subgroup women preval breast cancer conclus nation repres sampl peripostmenopaus women tyg associ higher odd preval breast cancer oxid stress uhr inflamm npr may partial explain relationship
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly aggressive solid tumor, with a 5-year survival rate of under 10% post-surgery. Surgical resection remains the only potentially curative treatment, but the outcome is heavily influenced by the tumor's biological heterogeneity. This results in considerable variations in patient prognosis. A particular challenge in PC is its diverse pathological subtypes, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma (PASC). While PDAC is the most common form, PASC is a rare but more aggressive variant with a worse prognosis. Despite similarities in treatment strategies, these subtypes exhibit distinct molecular profiles, and their response to therapy can vary significantly.This study aims to develop a machine learning-based prognostic tool that integrates multidimensional clinical data to overcome the limitations of single biomarkers, providing a more personalized and dynamic approach to monitoring postoperative survival outcomes. METHODS: In this study, two feature selection techniques (Boruta and LASSO) were used to identify key survival-related variables using clinical and laboratory data from postoperative pancreatic cancer patients. Nine commonly used machine learning models, including XGBoost, LightGBM, logistic regression, and random forest, were developed based on the most important 7 features and compared for predicting postoperative overall survival. We comprehensively evaluated the stability of the XGBoost sub-models, feature interpretability (via SHAP analysis), and generalizability across different pathologic subtypes. RESULTS: Among all models, XGBoost performed optimally on the validation set (AUROC = 0.796) and demonstrated consistent and stable performance in 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival prediction (AUROC = 0.593, 0.699, and 0.774) SHAP analysis showed that the variables of basophils, pathology type, DB, CA125, and HDL contributed the most to the prediction PDAC and PASC subtype analysis further confirmed the robustness and broad applicability of the model (AUC 0.730 and 0.822, respectively). The core features were related to clinical pathways, tumor microenvironment and patient system status, which enhanced the explanatory power and clinical translation potential of the model. CONCLUSION: The XGBoost-based machine learning model developed in this study integrates clinical, laboratory, and pathological data, providing superior predictive performance and good interpretability for assessing postoperative survival in pancreatic cancer. This model not only offers robust predictions for the general population but also effectively identifies risk variations across pathological subtypes. It holds substantial clinical value for postoperative risk stratification and decision-making in treatment planning.",background pancreat cancer pc highli aggress solid tumor 5year surviv rate 10 postsurgeri surgic resect remain potenti cur treatment outcom heavili influenc tumor biolog heterogen result consider variat patient prognosi particular challeng pc divers patholog subtyp includ pancreat ductal adenocarcinoma pdac pancreat adenosquam carcinoma pasc pdac common form pasc rare aggress variant wors prognosi despit similar treatment strategi subtyp exhibit distinct molecular profil respons therapi vari significantlythi studi aim develop machin learningbas prognost tool integr multidimension clinic data overcom limit singl biomark provid person dynam approach monitor postop surviv outcom method studi two featur select techniqu boruta lasso use identifi key survivalrel variabl use clinic laboratori data postop pancreat cancer patient nine commonli use machin learn model includ xgboost lightgbm logist regress random forest develop base import 7 featur compar predict postop overal surviv comprehens evalu stabil xgboost submodel featur interpret via shap analysi generaliz across differ patholog subtyp result among model xgboost perform optim valid set auroc 0796 demonstr consist stabl perform 1 3 5year surviv predict auroc 0593 0699 0774 shap analysi show variabl basophil patholog type db ca125 hdl contribut predict pdac pasc subtyp analysi confirm robust broad applic model auc 0730 0822 respect core featur relat clinic pathway tumor microenviron patient system statu enhanc explanatori power clinic translat potenti model conclus xgboostbas machin learn model develop studi integr clinic laboratori patholog data provid superior predict perform good interpret assess postop surviv pancreat cancer model offer robust predict gener popul also effect identifi risk variat across patholog subtyp hold substanti clinic valu postop risk stratif decisionmak treatment plan
cancer,"Tumor antigen vaccination represents an appealing approach for cancer but has failed to materialize as oncologic standard of care. To understand long-term vaccine efficacy, we conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with human epidermal growth receptor 2(+) (HER2(+)) breast cancer who received HER2-targeting vaccines and survived for >18 years. PBMC analysis revealed HER2-specific CD27(+) memory CD4 and CD8 T cells, suggesting that CD27 signaling supports long-term immune memory. In human CD27 transgenic mice, combining HER2 vaccination with anti-CD27 agonism enhanced HER2-specific responses, particularly long-lived CD4 memory T cells. Murine models demonstrated ~40% tumor regression with combined therapy compared with vaccine alone (~6%). Additional scRNA-seq analysis identified CD4 T cells with a distinct gene expression profile, and depletion/adoptive transfer studies validated that CD4 T cells were essential for this effect. These findings suggest that CD27 agonism enhances vaccine-induced antigen-specific CD4 T cell responses, enabling durable antitumor immunity not entirely dependent on CD8 T cells.",tumor antigen vaccin repres appeal approach cancer fail materi oncolog standard care understand longterm vaccin efficaci conduct retrospect analysi patient human epiderm growth receptor 2 her2 breast cancer receiv her2target vaccin surviv 18 year pbmc analysi reveal her2specif cd27 memori cd4 cd8 cell suggest cd27 signal support longterm immun memori human cd27 transgen mice combin her2 vaccin anticd27 agon enhanc her2specif respons particularli longliv cd4 memori cell murin model demonstr 40 tumor regress combin therapi compar vaccin alon 6 addit scrnaseq analysi identifi cd4 cell distinct gene express profil depletionadopt transfer studi valid cd4 cell essenti effect find suggest cd27 agon enhanc vaccineinduc antigenspecif cd4 cell respons enabl durabl antitumor immun entir depend cd8 cell
cancer,"Extracellular ATP (eATP), a well-recognized danger signal and immune activator, is implicated in the activation, differentiation, and function of T cells, directly or indirectly. Yet, how T cells release ATP themselves and its effects remain poorly investigated. Here, we found vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT), critical for vesicular ATP storage/release, is highly expressed in T(H)1 cells and selectively restricts their differentiation and effector functions. Mechanistically, VNUT facilitates lysosomal ATP import and its extracellular release upon T cell receptor engagement. This eATP then activates the purinergic receptor P2X7R and downstream SRC kinase, triggering a signaling cascade involving heightened Ca(2+) influx and hyperphosphorylation of JNK and FOXO3a, which ultimately impairs Eomes-directed IFN-gamma production in T(H)1 cells. Genetic/pharmacological of VNUT inhibition significantly potentiates T(H)1 effector functions against Listeria infection and transplanted tumors. These findings identify VNUT as a critical checkpoint in limiting T(H)1 immunity, coupling vesicular ATP transport to transcriptional control via the P2X7R-JNK-FOXO3a-Eomes axis, offering a target for treating infection and cancer.",extracellular atp eatp wellrecogn danger signal immun activ implic activ differenti function cell directli indirectli yet cell releas atp effect remain poorli investig found vesicular nucleotid transport vnut critic vesicular atp storagereleas highli express th1 cell select restrict differenti effector function mechanist vnut facilit lysosom atp import extracellular releas upon cell receptor engag eatp activ purinerg receptor p2x7r downstream src kinas trigger signal cascad involv heighten ca2 influx hyperphosphoryl jnk foxo3a ultim impair eomesdirect ifngamma product th1 cell geneticpharmacolog vnut inhibit significantli potenti th1 effector function listeria infect transplant tumor find identifi vnut critic checkpoint limit th1 immun coupl vesicular atp transport transcript control via p2x7rjnkfoxo3aeom axi offer target treat infect cancer
cancer,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) acts as a primary physical barrier to cancer metastasis. While individual cancer cells can remodel ECM to create microchannel-like paths of least resistance, this cell-centric view overlooks the coordinated dynamics of multicellular communication. Here, we reveal that cancer cells collaboratively reprogram ECM to construct interconnected microchannel networks functioning as ""superhighways"" for barrier-free metastasis. Combining live-cell imaging, atomic force microscopy, and optical tweezers, we decode that the indispensable step in microchannel network construction is organized cross-convergence of adjacent channels. The convergence is precisely directed by mechanical bridges composed of aligned collagen bundles between adjacent channels, which transmit orientation cues to induce multicellular force coordination. Integrating single-cell sequencing and off-lattice agent-based model, we identify mechanically responsive leader cells enriched for integrin-RhoA/YAP signaling and matrix metalloproteinase 14, which sense bridge cues and initiate cross-convergence. Collectively, our findings unveil a self-organized metastatic network and its mechanobiological mechanisms, offering a previously unidentified framework and potential therapeutic insights for cancer metastasis.",extracellular matrix ecm act primari physic barrier cancer metastasi individu cancer cell remodel ecm creat microchannellik path least resist cellcentr view overlook coordin dynam multicellular commun reveal cancer cell collabor reprogram ecm construct interconnect microchannel network function superhighway barrierfre metastasi combin livecel imag atom forc microscopi optic tweezer decod indispens step microchannel network construct organ crossconverg adjac channel converg precis direct mechan bridg compos align collagen bundl adjac channel transmit orient cue induc multicellular forc coordin integr singlecel sequenc offlattic agentbas model identifi mechan respons leader cell enrich integrinrhoayap signal matrix metalloproteinas 14 sens bridg cue initi crossconverg collect find unveil selforgan metastat network mechanobiolog mechan offer previous unidentifi framework potenti therapeut insight cancer metastasi
cancer,"Developing computational methods for single-cell drug response prediction deepens our understanding of tumor heterogeneity and uncovers resistance mechanisms critical to improving cancer therapy. However, current approaches struggle to fully capture intratumoral heterogeneity, as bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) obscures heterogeneity across individual cells, while single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) remains constrained by limited throughput and high cost. Current approaches integrating bulk and scRNA-seq data frequently encounter batch effects, impairing robust knowledge transfer. Moreover, most existing methods overlook the role of intercellular interactions, treating cells as isolated entities. To overcome these limitations, we propose DAGFormer, a Graph-based Domain Adaptation framework that integrates bulk and scRNA-seq data for predicting single-cell drug responses. DAGFormer constructs cellular neighbor graphs using diverse topological strategies and employs Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) to bridge graph-level distribution gaps between bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data. A dual-domain decoder further disentangles shared and modality-specific representations, preserving both general and unique biological signals. Benchmarking DAGFormer on ten independent scRNA-seq datasets demonstrated its superior performance compared to existing methods, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in cancer drug response prediction.",develop comput method singlecel drug respons predict deepen understand tumor heterogen uncov resist mechan critic improv cancer therapi howev current approach struggl fulli captur intratumor heterogen bulk rna sequenc bulk rnaseq obscur heterogen across individu cell singlecel rna sequenc scrnaseq remain constrain limit throughput high cost current approach integr bulk scrnaseq data frequent encount batch effect impair robust knowledg transfer moreov exist method overlook role intercellular interact treat cell isol entiti overcom limit propos dagform graphbas domain adapt framework integr bulk scrnaseq data predict singlecel drug respons dagform construct cellular neighbor graph use divers topolog strategi employ graph domain adapt gda bridg graphlevel distribut gap bulk singlecel rnaseq data dualdomain decod disentangl share modalityspecif represent preserv gener uniqu biolog signal benchmark dagform ten independ scrnaseq dataset demonstr superior perform compar exist method underscor effect robust cancer drug respons predict
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as pembrolizumab, are integral to cancer therapy but can cause severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). These rare, life-threatening reactions typically occur early in treatment, with delayed onset being less commonly reported. CASE REPORT: We present a 67-year-old female with triple-negative breast cancer who developed a diffuse, painful rash five months after discontinuing pembrolizumab. Physical exam revealed  approximately 15% body surface area involvement without mucosal lesions. Biopsy confirmed SJS/TEN overlap. The patient had previously experienced pembrolizumab-induced Grade 2 pneumonitis. MANAGEMENT & OUTCOME: Initial treatment with high-dose corticosteroids yielded minimal improvement. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was added, resulting in clinical stabilization. The patient was discharged after 11 days with a steroid taper and showed gradual symptom improvement at one-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: This case highlights an exceptionally delayed onset of pembrolizumab-induced SJS/TEN overlap, extending known timelines for irAE manifestation. Prior pneumonitis may have predisposed the patient to subsequent cutaneous toxicity. Despite a SCORTEN score predicting high mortality, aggressive immunosuppressive therapy led to a favorable outcome. This underscores the importance of prolonged vigilance and multidisciplinary management in patients with prior irAEs.",introduct immun checkpoint inhibitor ici pembrolizumab integr cancer therapi caus sever immunerel advers event ira includ stevensjohnson syndrom sj toxic epiderm necrolysi ten rare lifethreaten reaction typic occur earli treatment delay onset less commonli report case report present 67yearold femal tripleneg breast cancer develop diffus pain rash five month discontinu pembrolizumab physic exam reveal approxim 15 bodi surfac area involv without mucos lesion biopsi confirm sjsten overlap patient previous experienc pembrolizumabinduc grade 2 pneumon manag outcom initi treatment highdos corticosteroid yield minim improv intraven immunoglobulin ivig ad result clinic stabil patient discharg 11 day steroid taper show gradual symptom improv onemonth followup discuss case highlight except delay onset pembrolizumabinduc sjsten overlap extend known timelin ira manifest prior pneumon may predispos patient subsequ cutan toxic despit scorten score predict high mortal aggress immunosuppress therapi led favor outcom underscor import prolong vigil multidisciplinari manag patient prior ira
cancer,"PURPOSE: Oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) is a premalignant condition with a variable risk of malignant transformation (MT). This study investigates the recurrence and MT rates in an Iranian patient cohort with OED, evaluating associations with demographic factors, lifestyle habits, and histopathologic grading systems, with the aim of providing population-specific prognostic insights and enhancing disease prediction and patient outcomes. METHODS: This mixed cohort study included 89 surgically treated patients with OED, followed for 24-168 months. Demographic data, smoking and alcohol consumption history, recurrence, and MT status were collected from medical records. Histopathological grading was performed using both the WHO 2017 classification and a binary grading system. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox regression, and statistical tests were applied to identify prognostic factors. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: During follow-up, 22.5% (20/89) of patients experienced recurrence, and 30.3% (27/89) underwent MT. The tongue was the most common site for OED (48.3%), recurrence (55%), and MT (44.4%). Males were more frequently affected than females (60.7% vs. 39.3%,), but females tended to remain cancer-free more often. Smoking and alcohol consumption did not significantly influence cancer development. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed 50% of MT cases occurred after about 108 months (mean: 114.8 months). The combined mean survival for recurrence and MT was 92.8 months. Cox regression identified WHO grading as the only statistically significant predictor of MT and recurrence/MT (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The WHO grading system plays a crucial role in predicting the likelihood of OED recurrence and malignant transformation. Lesion location showed only a non-significant trend, suggesting that its effect may be mediated by grade. These findings highlight the importance of using grading-based risk assessments and ensuring close follow-up care to better manage OED and improve patient outcomes.",purpos oral epitheli dysplasia o premalign condit variabl risk malign transform mt studi investig recurr mt rate iranian patient cohort o evalu associ demograph factor lifestyl habit histopatholog grade system aim provid populationspecif prognost insight enhanc diseas predict patient outcom method mix cohort studi includ 89 surgic treat patient o follow 24168 month demograph data smoke alcohol consumpt histori recurr mt statu collect medic record histopatholog grade perform use 2017 classif binari grade system kaplanmei surviv analysi cox regress statist test appli identifi prognost factor pvalu 005 consid statist signific result followup 225 2089 patient experienc recurr 303 2789 underw mt tongu common site o 483 recurr 55 mt 444 male frequent affect femal 607 vs 393 femal tend remain cancerfre often smoke alcohol consumpt significantli influenc cancer develop kaplanmei analysi show 50 mt case occur 108 month mean 1148 month combin mean surviv recurr mt 928 month cox regress identifi grade statist signific predictor mt recurrencemt p 0001 conclus grade system play crucial role predict likelihood o recurr malign transform lesion locat show nonsignific trend suggest effect may mediat grade find highlight import use gradingbas risk assess ensur close followup care better manag o improv patient outcom
cancer,"Lung squamous-cell carcinoma (LUSC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) play a crucial role in the immune response and significantly influence the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, the prognostic and immunological implications of TLS-associated molecular subtypes in LUSC remain unclear. In this study, we applied 10 multi-omics integration strategies to perform a multi-omics analysis of the mRNA expression profiles, DNA methylation, and genomic mutation data of 39 TLSs-related genes, along with long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression profiles, to generate integrated consensus subtypes of LUSC. Four molecular subtypes were identified: cancer subtype 1 (CS1), CS2, CS3, and CS4. We observed a significant difference in overall survival between cancer subtype 1 (CS1) and CS3. Subsequently, we identified 33 prognosis-related genes based on differential expression between CS1 and CS3, which were further refined to 20 genes using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression algorithm, and constructed a prognostic signature termed the LUSC-Survival Prediction Index (LUSCSPI). The high-LUSCSPI group demonstrated a poor prognosis and was more likely to benefit from treatment with nine chemotherapeutic agents (shikonin, doxorubicin, CMK, S-Trityl-L-cysteine, paclitaxel, DMOG, gemcitabine, erlotinib, and crizotinib). In contrast, the low-LUSCSPI group exhibited a more favorable prognosis, with thapsigargin and cisplatin identified as promising treatment options. In conclusion, our results highlight the potential of LUSCSPI as an independent prognostic factor for LUSC. Further, the multi-omics consensus approach provides a robust foundation for prognostic stratification in LUSC patients, facilitating personalized treatment and disease management.",lung squamouscel carcinoma lusc highli aggress malign poor prognosi tertiari lymphoid structur tl play crucial role immun respons significantli influenc efficaci immunotherapi howev prognost immunolog implic tlsassoci molecular subtyp lusc remain unclear studi appli 10 multiom integr strategi perform multiom analysi mrna express profil dna methyl genom mutat data 39 tlssrelat gene along long noncod rna lncrna express profil gener integr consensu subtyp lusc four molecular subtyp identifi cancer subtyp 1 cs1 cs2 cs3 cs4 observ signific differ overal surviv cancer subtyp 1 cs1 cs3 subsequ identifi 33 prognosisrel gene base differenti express cs1 cs3 refin 20 gene use least absolut shrinkag select oper lasso regress algorithm construct prognost signatur term luscsurviv predict index luscspi highluscspi group demonstr poor prognosi like benefit treatment nine chemotherapeut agent shikonin doxorubicin cmk strityllcystein paclitaxel dmog gemcitabin erlotinib crizotinib contrast lowluscspi group exhibit favor prognosi thapsigargin cisplatin identifi promis treatment option conclus result highlight potenti luscspi independ prognost factor lusc multiom consensu approach provid robust foundat prognost stratif lusc patient facilit person treatment diseas manag
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Glioma is the most common malignant tumor of the central nervous system, and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) may play a crucial role in its progression. Our study aimed to predict the impact of HRD on glioma heterogeneity and patient prognosis from a multi-omics perspective. METHODS: We integrated HRD-related gene expression levels and survival information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases. Using a combination of machine learning algorithms, we identified the optimal algorithm and constructed the HRD Index model. After validating the model's accuracy, we assessed the expression heterogeneity of HRD-related genes in vitro using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Multiple omics analyses, including enrichment analysis, genomics, prediction of immune cell subtype infiltration, and drug sensitivity, were employed to demonstrate the heterogeneity and clinical predictive significance of the HRD Index in glioma. RESULTS: Through algorithm selection, the LASSO-RSF (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator - Random Survival Forest) algorithm identified 7 genes (POLR2F, FANCB, PTEN, PLK3, INO80D, PRMT6, and UNG) to construct the HRD Index. Model validation demonstrated excellent accuracy. qPCR results revealed differential expression of these HRD Index genes among different cell lines. Samples grouped by HRD Index showed potential differences in certain cytokine and receptor pathways, as well as varying gene mutation frequencies between groups. Drug sensitivity analysis indicated that the HRD Index could predict treatment efficacy for specific drugs. CONCLUSION: Our HRD Index model based on these seven genes significantly correlated with clinical prognosis in glioma patients and holds promise for guiding clinical management.",background glioma common malign tumor central nervou system homolog recombin defici hrd may play crucial role progress studi aim predict impact hrd glioma heterogen patient prognosi multiom perspect method integr hrdrelat gene express level surviv inform cancer genom atla tcga chines glioma genom atla cgga databas use combin machin learn algorithm identifi optim algorithm construct hrd index model valid model accuraci assess express heterogen hrdrelat gene vitro use quantit polymeras chain reaction qpcr multipl omic analys includ enrich analysi genom predict immun cell subtyp infiltr drug sensit employ demonstr heterogen clinic predict signific hrd index glioma result algorithm select lassorsf least absolut shrinkag select oper random surviv forest algorithm identifi 7 gene polr2f fancb pten plk3 ino80d prmt6 ung construct hrd index model valid demonstr excel accuraci qpcr result reveal differenti express hrd index gene among differ cell line sampl group hrd index show potenti differ certain cytokin receptor pathway well vari gene mutat frequenc group drug sensit analysi indic hrd index could predict treatment efficaci specif drug conclus hrd index model base seven gene significantli correl clinic prognosi glioma patient hold promis guid clinic manag
cancer,"Combined use of opioids and other pharmacological therapies used for pain management, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, and/or skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs), in older adult cancer survivors can increase the risk of mortality. The objective of this study was to identify the leading predictors of opioid combination therapy with other therapies that may be inappropriate in older adults with cancer using interpretable machine learning approaches. A retrospective cohort design of older (> 66 years at diagnosis) cancer survivors (N = 2,682) diagnosed with primary and incident cancer in 2014. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry linked with Medicare claims database was used. Recursive feature elimination with random forest was used to extract the optimal number of features out of 119 for predictive modeling. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and global feature importance were used to identify the leading predictors and their associations with opioid combination therapy. Overall, 37.4% of older adults with cancer used opioid combination therapy. We included 34 features in the final predictive model.The predictive model had a good high area under the curve (AUC, 0. 758) and high recall (0.821) with the test dataset. We included 34 features in the final predictive model. Baseline opioids, NSAIDs, benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, chemotherapy, surgery, and female sex generally positively predicted opioid combination therapy. We observed relationships of zip code percentage residents and Native American residents living below poverty with opioid combination therapy. Patient-level baseline medication use, biological factors, cancer treatment, and zip code-level poverty were leading predictors of opioid combination therapy.

cancer,"Myricetin (ME) is a flavonoid found in various plant-based foods, recognized for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. This study evaluated the antiproliferative and antimutagenic potential of ME, both isolated and in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin (OXL), using in vitro models. Cytotoxicity was assessed in the NCI-H460 non-small cell lung cancer cell line via the MTT assay, while the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-Cyt) assay was performed in CHO-K1 non-tumoral cells to investigate chromosomal instability and cytostasis. ME at concentrations of 5 and 10 microM significantly reduced the viability of NCI-H460 cells, demonstrating a cytotoxic effect. OXL alone also reduced cell viability; however, when combined with ME, this effect was attenuated, suggesting a protective or antagonistic interaction. In CHO-K1 cells, ME did not modulate cytostasis induced by OXL in any treatment protocol. Regarding genotoxicity, ME failed to reduce chromosomal damage markers (micronuclei, nucleoplasmic bridges, and nuclear buds) when administered before or simultaneously with OXL. Interestingly, post-treatment with ME significantly increased the frequency of micronuclei induced by OXL, indicating a potentiating effect. These findings suggest that although ME possesses antiproliferative activity against tumor cells, it may also interfere with the efficacy of OXL depending on the treatment schedule. The results contribute to understanding the dual role of phytochemicals in chemotherapy, emphasizing the importance of evaluating timing and interaction in combination therapies.",myricetin flavonoid found variou plantbas food recogn antiinflammatori antioxid anticanc properti studi evalu antiprolif antimutagen potenti isol combin chemotherapeut agent oxaliplatin oxl use vitro model cytotox assess ncih460 nonsmal cell lung cancer cell line via mtt assay cytokinesisblock micronucleu cytom cbmncyt assay perform chok1 nontumor cell investig chromosom instabl cytostasi concentr 5 10 microm significantli reduc viabil ncih460 cell demonstr cytotox effect oxl alon also reduc cell viabil howev combin effect attenu suggest protect antagonist interact chok1 cell modul cytostasi induc oxl treatment protocol regard genotox fail reduc chromosom damag marker micronuclei nucleoplasm bridg nuclear bud administ simultan oxl interestingli posttreat significantli increas frequenc micronuclei induc oxl indic potenti effect find suggest although possess antiprolif activ tumor cell may also interfer efficaci oxl depend treatment schedul result contribut understand dual role phytochem chemotherapi emphas import evalu time interact combin therapi
cancer,"Chromatin remodeling plays an integral part in endometrial homeostasis through its roles in the maintenance of cell identity, epithelial integrity, and prevention of endometrial disease. Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) is a chromatin remodeling protein and member of the NuRD complex, which predominantly represses transcription. CHD4 is mutated in endometrial carcinoma, with most mutations resulting in loss of function. CHD4 has been identified as a tumor suppressor and regulator of stemness in human endometrial carcinoma cell lines, but little is known about the tissue-specific roles of CHD4 in the endometrial epithelia in vivo. We generated a conditional Chd4 floxed allele and combined it with BAC-Sprr2f-Cre to drive CHD4 loss in the endometrial epithelium. Consistent with previous reports, BAC-Sprr2f-Cre shows variegated expression within the endometrial epithelium and lacks expression in the oviducts, ovaries, and kidneys. Loss of CHD4 was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, and the percentage of endometrial epithelial cells with and without CHD4 was quantified. Compared to the glandular epithelium, the extent of CHD4 loss was higher in the luminal epithelium and unaffected by age. Mice with conditional knockout of Chd4 had normal endometrial histology. A six-month breeding trial was performed to assess the functional effects of endometrial epithelial CHD4 loss on fertility and found no difference in litter size, average litter size per dam, or pup weight between genotypes. These findings demonstrate that Chd4 conditional knockout using BAC-Sprr2f-Cre is not sufficient to alter the structure and function of the endometrial epithelium or drive tumorigenesis. As CHD4 is frequently co-mutated with other cancer driver genes such as TP53, PIK3CA, and PTEN, future mouse modeling efforts emulating patient mutational profiles might provide insight into the role of CHD4 in endometrial carcinoma.",chromatin remodel play integr part endometri homeostasi role mainten cell ident epitheli integr prevent endometri diseas chromodomainhelicasednabind protein 4 chd4 chromatin remodel protein member nurd complex predominantli repress transcript chd4 mutat endometri carcinoma mutat result loss function chd4 identifi tumor suppressor regul stem human endometri carcinoma cell line littl known tissuespecif role chd4 endometri epithelia vivo gener condit chd4 flox allel combin bacsprr2fcr drive chd4 loss endometri epithelium consist previou report bacsprr2fcr show varieg express within endometri epithelium lack express oviduct ovari kidney loss chd4 confirm immunohistochemistri percentag endometri epitheli cell without chd4 quantifi compar glandular epithelium extent chd4 loss higher lumin epithelium unaffect age mice condit knockout chd4 normal endometri histolog sixmonth breed trial perform assess function effect endometri epitheli chd4 loss fertil found differ litter size averag litter size per dam pup weight genotyp find demonstr chd4 condit knockout use bacsprr2fcr suffici alter structur function endometri epithelium drive tumorigenesi chd4 frequent comut cancer driver gene tp53 pik3ca pten futur mous model effort emul patient mutat profil might provid insight role chd4 endometri carcinoma
cancer,"Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) can activate the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 in the gut. However, its source and role in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that ssRNA within fecal extracellular vesicles (FEVs) derived from bacteria, particularly those susceptible to lysis by ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), can suppress CRC progression via Piezo1 activation. Gut-specific Piezo1-knockout mice developed more tumors following CRC induction. Similarly, Piezo1-deficient CRC cell lines exhibited increased proliferation with upregulated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Mechanistically, Piezo1 activation downregulated the transcription factor Zfp281, decreasing the expression of its target gene Lgr5 and dampening Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Notably, oral UDCA administration enhanced FEV rupture, increasing luminal ""naked"" ssRNA and mitigating high-fat diet-induced CRC in vivo. These findings identify the bacterial ssRNA-Piezo1 axis as a potential therapeutic target in CRC.",singlestrand rna ssrna activ mechanosensit ion channel piezo1 gut howev sourc role colorect cancer crc remain unclear present studi demonstr ssrna within fecal extracellular vesicl fev deriv bacteria particularli suscept lysi ursodeoxychol acid udca suppress crc progress via piezo1 activ gutspecif piezo1knockout mice develop tumor follow crc induct similarli piezo1defici crc cell line exhibit increas prolifer upregul wntbetacatenin signal mechanist piezo1 activ downregul transcript factor zfp281 decreas express target gene lgr5 dampen wntbetacatenin signal notabl oral udca administr enhanc fev ruptur increas lumin nake ssrna mitig highfat dietinduc crc vivo find identifi bacteri ssrnapiezo1 axi potenti therapeut target crc
cancer,"Cancer immunotherapy has transformed cancer treatment, yet only a minority of patients achieve durable benefit. Although early efforts to enhance immunotherapy focused on boosting immune effector function, reversing T cell exhaustion, or altering the tumor microenvironment, it is now clear that cancer cell-autonomous mechanisms play a major role in immune escape. Such programs, driven by the cancer cell genome, transcriptome, and epigenome, include desensitization to cytokine signaling, such as interferon (IFN)gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF); impaired antigen presentation; upregulation of suppressive ligands such as programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1); and epigenetic silencing of immunogenic pathways. The rise of high-throughput functional genomics, especially in vitro and in vivo CRISPR-based screening, has greatly expanded our ability to map these pathways and define how tumors evade CD8(+) T cell-mediated pressure. A deeper understanding of these cancer cell-autonomous immune-evasion mechanisms will be essential for developing new therapeutic strategies that broaden the impact of immunotherapy across diverse cancers.",cancer immunotherapi transform cancer treatment yet minor patient achiev durabl benefit although earli effort enhanc immunotherapi focus boost immun effector function revers cell exhaust alter tumor microenviron clear cancer cellautonom mechan play major role immun escap program driven cancer cell genom transcriptom epigenom includ desensit cytokin signal interferon ifngamma tumor necrosi factor tnf impair antigen present upregul suppress ligand program cell death ligand 1 pdl1 epigenet silenc immunogen pathway rise highthroughput function genom especi vitro vivo crisprbas screen greatli expand abil map pathway defin tumor evad cd8 cellmedi pressur deeper understand cancer cellautonom immuneevas mechan essenti develop new therapeut strategi broaden impact immunotherapi across divers cancer
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: The nasal subunit of the soft triangle is an area known for its unique reconstructive challenges due to its complex anatomical structure coupled with its critical aesthetic and functional roles. METHODS: The systematic review was performed using PRISMA guidelines to evaluate techniques for soft triangle reconstruction and help guide surgeons for their best-fit reconstruction based on the size and composition of the defect they are faced with. A literature search was conducted to include the databases of MEDLINE via OVID, EMBASE, CINAHL, PubMed, and Cochrane central registry of trials. RESULTS: In the review, 13 studies were selected, encompassing 900 patients with differing defects ranging from 0.6 to 5.5 cm in size. Our study outlines complication rates experienced, revision rate, and surgeon vs patient outcome measures where they are reported.

cancer,"This study aimed to identify the clinicopathological features of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), detected at the stage of T1a-MM or deeper despite undergoing annual endoscopic surveillance. This retrospective study included cases of early ESCC treated with endoscopic resection at this hospital from January 2015 to October 2024. Inclusion criteria were: (i) A case identified as a high-risk patient for ESCC due to the presence of multiple Lugol-voiding lesions . (ii) Screening endoscopy performed at intervals of 12 months or less. (iii) The depth of lesions detected under appropriate screening and treated with endoscopic resection was pT1a-MM or deeper. Five cases met the criteria, with a median age of 68 years (range: 48-81); all patients were male. The prior endoscopic examination before the detection was performed 6 months earlier in two cases and 12 months earlier in three cases. Among the cases, three lesions were located in the cervical esophagus (Ce), one in the middle thoracic esophagus (Mt), and one in the lower thoracic esophagus (Lt); the Mt and Lt lesions were on the anterior wall. The three Ce lesions measured 5-10 mm, while the Mt and Lt lesions measured 6 mm and 10 mm, respectively. Four lesions were diagnosed as pT1a-MM, and the Ce lesion as pT1b-SM2 with positive vascular invasion. The patient diagnosed with submucosa lesion received additional chemoradiotherapy. None of the patients have experienced cancer recurrence. This case series suggests that the Ce and the anterior wall of the Mt and Lt may be areas that require particular attention during routine ESCC surveillance. These findings may help improve quality of surveillance endoscopy for ESCC high-risk patients.",studi aim identifi clinicopatholog featur esophag squamou cell carcinoma escc detect stage t1amm deeper despit undergo annual endoscop surveil retrospect studi includ case earli escc treat endoscop resect hospit januari 2015 octob 2024 inclus criteria case identifi highrisk patient escc due presenc multipl lugolvoid lesion ii screen endoscopi perform interv 12 month less iii depth lesion detect appropri screen treat endoscop resect pt1amm deeper five case met criteria median age 68 year rang 4881 patient male prior endoscop examin detect perform 6 month earlier two case 12 month earlier three case among case three lesion locat cervic esophagu ce one middl thorac esophagu mt one lower thorac esophagu lt mt lt lesion anterior wall three ce lesion measur 510 mm mt lt lesion measur 6 mm 10 mm respect four lesion diagnos pt1amm ce lesion pt1bsm2 posit vascular invas patient diagnos submucosa lesion receiv addit chemoradiotherapi none patient experienc cancer recurr case seri suggest ce anterior wall mt lt may area requir particular attent routin escc surveil find may help improv qualiti surveil endoscopi escc highrisk patient
cancer,"As essential functional components of the cell membrane, membrane proteins serve as one of the key mechanisms for sensing external stimuli and play crucial roles in diverse biological processes, including cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. These processes are closely related to the maintenance of physiological homeostasis and the progression of various diseases. In recent years, with an in-depth understanding of membrane protein functions, developing membrane protein regulation strategies has emerged as a significant direction in both basic research and therapeutic applications. Precise modulation of membrane protein expression levels, conformational changes, and spatial distribution enables artificial regulation of cellular behavior, thereby opening promising avenues for treating diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and immune dysfunctions. This review comprehensively summarizes various physical technologies and biomolecule-driven approaches for membrane protein regulation, including applying light/temperature/magnetism/ultrasound-sensitive modules to achieve external physical control, as well as biomolecular tools, such as DNA, peptides, and proteins with specific receptor recognition properties that modulate membrane proteins via intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, the advantages and limitations of different membrane protein regulation techniques are discussed, aiming to provide new insights into cell function regulation and disease treatment.",essenti function compon cell membran membran protein serv one key mechan sens extern stimuli play crucial role divers biolog process includ cell migrat prolifer differenti apoptosi process close relat mainten physiolog homeostasi progress variou diseas recent year indepth understand membran protein function develop membran protein regul strategi emerg signific direct basic research therapeut applic precis modul membran protein express level conform chang spatial distribut enabl artifici regul cellular behavior therebi open promis avenu treat diseas cancer neurodegen disord immun dysfunct review comprehens summar variou physic technolog biomoleculedriven approach membran protein regul includ appli lighttemperaturemagnetismultrasoundsensit modul achiev extern physic control well biomolecular tool dna peptid protein specif receptor recognit properti modul membran protein via intermolecular interact furthermor advantag limit differ membran protein regul techniqu discuss aim provid new insight cell function regul diseas treatment
cancer,"Accurate tumor response assessment to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) is crucial for personalized treatment strategies in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). However, reliable non-invasive assessment tool remains clinically lacking. To fill this unmet need, MR-DELTAnet, a longitudinal MRI-based Transformer framework that integrates Delta-Efficient Latent-Temporal Attention, is constructed to predict pathological complete response (pCR) to NCRT in locally advanced rectal cancer patients. In a multicenter retrospective cohort of 1,026 LARC patients between July 2012 and July 2023, MR-DELTAnet demonstrated robust discriminative performance across independent datasets, with the area under the curves (AUC) of 0.93 (95% CI 0.90-0.96), 0.88 (95% CI 0.82-0.94) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.79-1.00) and in training (n horizontal line633), internal validation (n horizontal line212) and external validation (n horizontal line181) sets, respectively. Risk-stratification by MR-DELTAnet prediction scores reveals significant survival differences: low-score patients exhibit prolonged disease-free and overall survival versus high-score patients (log-rank p<0.05). Applying the model to an independent single-cell RNA sequencing cohort (n horizontal line26) discloses biologically distinct immune microenvironments: high-score tumors are myeloid-rich and immunosuppressive, whereas low-score tumors harbor cytotoxic T-cell-dominant. Clinically, MR-DELTAnet provides an accurate, non-invasive tool for preoperative identification of pCR likelihood and biological phenotype, thereby potentially informing individualized treatment strategies for LARC management.",accur tumor respons assess neoadjuv chemoradiotherapi ncrt crucial person treatment strategi local advanc rectal cancer larc howev reliabl noninvas assess tool remain clinic lack fill unmet need mrdeltanet longitudin mribas transform framework integr deltaeffici latenttempor attent construct predict patholog complet respons pcr ncrt local advanc rectal cancer patient multicent retrospect cohort 1026 larc patient juli 2012 juli 2023 mrdeltanet demonstr robust discrimin perform across independ dataset area curv auc 093 95 ci 090096 088 95 ci 082094 090 95 ci 079100 train n horizont line633 intern valid n horizont line212 extern valid n horizont line181 set respect riskstratif mrdeltanet predict score reveal signific surviv differ lowscor patient exhibit prolong diseasefre overal surviv versu highscor patient logrank p005 appli model independ singlecel rna sequenc cohort n horizont line26 disclos biolog distinct immun microenviron highscor tumor myeloidrich immunosuppress wherea lowscor tumor harbor cytotox tcelldomin clinic mrdeltanet provid accur noninvas tool preoper identif pcr likelihood biolog phenotyp therebi potenti inform individu treatment strategi larc manag
cancer,"Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), caused by biallelic mutations in the ATM gene, leads to multiple disease phenotypes, including cerebellar neurodegeneration, radiosensitivity, cancer predisposition, immunodeficiency, insulin resistance, and pulmonary inflammation. ATM plays a central role in regulating cellular responses to DNA breakage [M. B. Kastan, J. Bartek, Nature 432, 316-323 (2004)], but several cellular and physiologic abnormalities associated with ATM dysfunction suggest the possibility of noncanonical roles for ATM as well. Herein, we identified the HSP90 paralogue, GRP94, as an ATM interactor/substrate and found that ATM influences N-glycosylation of GRP94 and its subsequent activation/translocation to the plasma membrane, where it serves as a scaffold protein and stabilizer for several membrane proteins, including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as EGFR and IGF1-R. In selected cell types, ATM loss/inhibition resulted in increased cell surface expression of RTKs and overactivation of RTK pathways, alterations that were rescued by specific inhibition of cell surface GRP94. This ATM/GRP94 pathway also regulated the activation of microglial cells, manifest as increased cytokine production and phagocytosis activity associated with ATM loss/inhibition and reversal of that activation with GRP94 inhibition. These results identified GRP94 as an ATM interactor and apparent substrate and demonstrated specific critical regulatory roles for ATM outside of DNA damage signaling. These insights provide potential explanations for several of the phenotypes associated with ATM dysfunction and potential opportunities for novel approaches to blunt clinical symptoms in A-T, and also suggest that other neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders might benefit from selective inhibition of cell surface GRP94.",ataxiatelangiectasia caus biallel mutat atm gene lead multipl diseas phenotyp includ cerebellar neurodegener radiosensit cancer predisposit immunodefici insulin resist pulmonari inflamm atm play central role regul cellular respons dna breakag b kastan j bartek natur 432 316323 2004 sever cellular physiolog abnorm associ atm dysfunct suggest possibl noncanon role atm well herein identifi hsp90 paralogu grp94 atm interactorsubstr found atm influenc nglycosyl grp94 subsequ activationtransloc plasma membran serv scaffold protein stabil sever membran protein includ receptor tyrosin kinas rtk egfr igf1r select cell type atm lossinhibit result increas cell surfac express rtk overactiv rtk pathway alter rescu specif inhibit cell surfac grp94 atmgrp94 pathway also regul activ microgli cell manifest increas cytokin product phagocytosi activ associ atm lossinhibit revers activ grp94 inhibit result identifi grp94 atm interactor appar substrat demonstr specif critic regulatori role atm outsid dna damag signal insight provid potenti explan sever phenotyp associ atm dysfunct potenti opportun novel approach blunt clinic symptom also suggest neurodegen inflammatori disord might benefit select inhibit cell surfac grp94
cancer,"Dynamic, high-throughput monitoring of cell viability is essential for assessing pathological progression and pharmacological efficacy. However, techniques capable of noninvasive, real-time tracking throughout the entire cell life cycle remain scarce. Here, we report a label-free dynamic monitoring method based on cell diffraction fingerprint imaging. This approach leverages a cell height characteristic spectrum derived from diffraction patterns to visualize and quantify the evolution of the cell viability. The method successfully resolved the four distinct stages of apoptosis and demonstrated that texture parameters derived from the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) effectively cluster cells according to their viability state. To validate its pharmacological applicability, we further employed the platform to assess the cytotoxicity of various drug combinations, including natural products (e.g., tea extracts) and conventional drugs. It successfully quantified their differential efficacy against cancer cells. This work presents a paradigm for continuous, noninvasive, single-cell-level viability monitoring, offering a robust analytical tool for mechanism-of-action studies, functional cellular assessment, and high-throughput drug screening. It also provides a theoretical and methodological foundation for advancing label-free optical imaging in cell pathology and biomedical engineering.",dynam highthroughput monitor cell viabil essenti assess patholog progress pharmacolog efficaci howev techniqu capabl noninvas realtim track throughout entir cell life cycl remain scarc report labelfre dynam monitor method base cell diffract fingerprint imag approach leverag cell height characterist spectrum deriv diffract pattern visual quantifi evolut cell viabil method success resolv four distinct stage apoptosi demonstr textur paramet deriv graylevel cooccurr matrix glcm effect cluster cell accord viabil state valid pharmacolog applic employ platform assess cytotox variou drug combin includ natur product eg tea extract convent drug success quantifi differenti efficaci cancer cell work present paradigm continu noninvas singlecelllevel viabil monitor offer robust analyt tool mechanismofact studi function cellular assess highthroughput drug screen also provid theoret methodolog foundat advanc labelfre optic imag cell patholog biomed engin
cancer,"Immune checkpoint blockade-directed immunotherapy emerges as a revolutionary therapy in gastric cancer (GC). However, the proportion of patients who can benefit from it and its overall efficacy remain limited. Here the aim is to identify key dual-function targets that both inhibit proliferation and suppress immune evasion. Using whole genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based screening, the serine/threonine kinase T-lymphokine-activated killer cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) is identified as a key regulator of PD-L1 in gastric cancer upon IFN-gamma stimulation. Mechanical study is performed to explore the role of TOPK in promoting GC malignancy and immune evasion in vitro and vivo. Higher TOPK levels in tumor tissues are observed, correlated with clinical stages, efficacy and survival. Upon IFN-gamma stimulation, TOPK phosphorylates eIF4F complex component eIF4A1 to increase its unwinding activity of STAT1 mRNA, enhancing STAT1 translation efficiency. This process leads to adaptive overexpression of PD-L1 and IDO1, resulting in immunometabolic suppression through PD-L1-mediated inhibition, IDO1-induced tryptophan depletion and kynurenine production. TOPK inhibitors reshape tumor immunometabolic microenvironment to trigger anti-tumor immunity in GC. The IFN-gamma-TOPK-eIF4F-STAT1-PD-L1/IDO1 axis as a crucial regulator of the tumor immunometabolic microenvironment and provide novel insights into the combination of targeted therapy and immunotherapy for GC treatment.",immun checkpoint blockadedirect immunotherapi emerg revolutionari therapi gastric cancer gc howev proport patient benefit overal efficaci remain limit aim identifi key dualfunct target inhibit prolifer suppress immun evas use whole genomewid crisprcas9bas screen serinethreonin kinas tlymphokineactiv killer cellorigin protein kinas topk identifi key regul pdl1 gastric cancer upon ifngamma stimul mechan studi perform explor role topk promot gc malign immun evas vitro vivo higher topk level tumor tissu observ correl clinic stage efficaci surviv upon ifngamma stimul topk phosphoryl eif4f complex compon eif4a1 increas unwind activ stat1 mrna enhanc stat1 translat effici process lead adapt overexpress pdl1 ido1 result immunometabol suppress pdl1mediat inhibit ido1induc tryptophan deplet kynurenin product topk inhibitor reshap tumor immunometabol microenviron trigger antitumor immun gc ifngammatopkeif4fstat1pdl1ido1 axi crucial regul tumor immunometabol microenviron provid novel insight combin target therapi immunotherapi gc treatment
cancer,"Microplastics (MPs) and their degradation products pose growing environmental and health risks. This study investigates how polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-derived degradation products, ethylene glycol (EG) and terephthalic acid (TPA), influence colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis. Integrating network toxicology, machine learning (ML), and molecular docking, we identified 43 genes linking EG/TPA exposure to CRC pathogenesis. Functional enrichment analysis revealed their involvement in TNF/IL-17 signaling and glucocorticoid (GC)-mediated metabolic pathways, synergistically promoting chronic inflammation and immune suppression. Prognostic ML models prioritized SPP1, TJP1, and DDIT3 as hub genes significantly correlated with poor survival outcomes. Molecular docking confirmed EG's stable binding to these targets, suggesting mechanisms involving cytoskeletal remodeling, tight junction disruption, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Notably, GC pathway activation emerged as a critical driver of CRC progression, facilitating tumor immune evasion and therapy resistance. Our findings highlight the prognostic relevance of PET-derived MPs via GC signaling dysregulation, providing mechanistic insights into how environmental pollutants exacerbate cancer risks. This study advances strategies for refining MPs toxicity assessments and developing targeted interventions to mitigate CRC progression linked to MPs exposure.",microplast mp degrad product pose grow environment health risk studi investig polyethylen terephthal petderiv degrad product ethylen glycol eg terephthal acid tpa influenc colorect cancer crc prognosi integr network toxicolog machin learn ml molecular dock identifi 43 gene link egtpa exposur crc pathogenesi function enrich analysi reveal involv tnfil17 signal glucocorticoid gcmediat metabol pathway synergist promot chronic inflamm immun suppress prognost ml model priorit spp1 tjp1 ddit3 hub gene significantli correl poor surviv outcom molecular dock confirm eg stabl bind target suggest mechan involv cytoskelet remodel tight junction disrupt endoplasm reticulum stress notabl gc pathway activ emerg critic driver crc progress facilit tumor immun evas therapi resist find highlight prognost relev petderiv mp via gc signal dysregul provid mechanist insight environment pollut exacerb cancer risk studi advanc strategi refin mp toxic assess develop target intervent mitig crc progress link mp exposur
cancer,"AIM: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a major cause of cancer death, highlights the need for biomarkers predicting early progressive disease (PD) under atezolizumab/bevacizumab (Atezo/Bev) therapy. We used the proximity extension assay (PEA) to identify plasma biomarkers linked to early PD. METHODS: This study included 47 patients with unresectable HCC treated with Atezo/Bev, divided into derivation (n = 27) and validation (n = 20) cohorts. To identify plasma biomarkers for early PD, 92 cytokines were measured by PEA; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were then used to determine key protein cutoffs in derivation. Cutoff validity was confirmed in validation. RESULTS: PEA showed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2), and Tie-2 were elevated in early PD cases. ELISA confirmed significantly higher levels in early PD versus nonearly PD (VEGF-A: 78.3 pg/mL vs. 53.2 pg/mL and p = 0.002; ANGPT2: 18.4 ng/mL vs. 12.7 ng/mL and p = 0.007; and Tie-2: 24.5 ng/mL vs. 17.6 ng/mL and p = 0.009). After establishing cutoff values for each protein, multivariate logistic regression analysis incorporating clinical background identified VEGF-A as the sole independent predictor of early PD (cutoff: 73.9 pg/mL, OR: 40.00, and p = 0.006). The predictive value of VEGF-A for early PD was evaluated in the validation cohort. With a cutoff of 73.9 pg/mL, early PD occurred in 21.4% and 83.3% of the low (n = 14) and high VEGF-A groups (n = 6), respectively (p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma VEGF-A levels were identified as a significant biomarker for early PD in individuals with HCC receiving Atezo/Bev therapy.",aim hepatocellular carcinoma hcc major caus cancer death highlight need biomark predict earli progress diseas pd atezolizumabbevacizumab atezobev therapi use proxim extens assay pea identifi plasma biomark link earli pd method studi includ 47 patient unresect hcc treat atezobev divid deriv n 27 valid n 20 cohort identifi plasma biomark earli pd 92 cytokin measur pea enzymelink immunosorb assay elisa use determin key protein cutoff deriv cutoff valid confirm valid result pea show vascular endotheli growth factor vegfa angiopoietin2 angpt2 tie2 elev earli pd case elisa confirm significantli higher level earli pd versu nonearli pd vegfa 783 pgml vs 532 pgml p 0002 angpt2 184 ngml vs 127 ngml p 0007 tie2 245 ngml vs 176 ngml p 0009 establish cutoff valu protein multivari logist regress analysi incorpor clinic background identifi vegfa sole independ predictor earli pd cutoff 739 pgml 4000 p 0006 predict valu vegfa earli pd evalu valid cohort cutoff 739 pgml earli pd occur 214 833 low n 14 high vegfa group n 6 respect p 0018 conclus plasma vegfa level identifi signific biomark earli pd individu hcc receiv atezobev therapi
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Mismatch-repair deficiency (MMRd) is a pan-cancer mechanism resulting in high tumor mutation and microsatellite burden, leading to remarkable therapeutic success using immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). However, efficacy remains variable. Our goal is to review the existing and emerging literature that provide mechanistic insights on how MMRd diversely impacts the current landscape of cancer therapeutics. AREAS COVERED: We summarize the biological impact of MMRd, highlight how variable etiologies and different MMRd cancer-types have significant diversity in genomic and immune profiles, how this drives primary and acquired ICI-resistance, and highlight the clinical trial landscape and preclinical efforts to harness these distinct mechanistic vulnerabilities into new therapeutic strategies. EXPERT OPINION: MMRd is currently recognized a tumor-agnostic biomarker for ICI treatment. However, differences in the MMRd etio-biology impact the immune microenvironment, contributing to significant response heterogeneity. Some patients show dramatic response to neoadjuvant ICI monotherapy and don't even need surgery, while most will need biologically rational combination approaches. Additionally, MMRd-driven genomic instability can make this a 'moving target,' mandating an ongoing effort to track and adapt to MMRd-driven cancer and microenvironment evolution. The next decade will focus on how best to effectively tailor immune-directed therapies for different MMRd cancers.",introduct mismatchrepair defici mmrd pancanc mechan result high tumor mutat microsatellit burden lead remark therapeut success use immun checkpoint inhibit ici howev efficaci remain variabl goal review exist emerg literatur provid mechanist insight mmrd divers impact current landscap cancer therapeut area cover summar biolog impact mmrd highlight variabl etiolog differ mmrd cancertyp signific divers genom immun profil drive primari acquir iciresist highlight clinic trial landscap preclin effort har distinct mechanist vulner new therapeut strategi expert opinion mmrd current recogn tumoragnost biomark ici treatment howev differ mmrd etiobiolog impact immun microenviron contribut signific respons heterogen patient show dramat respons neoadjuv ici monotherapi dont even need surgeri need biolog ration combin approach addit mmrddriven genom instabl make move target mandat ongo effort track adapt mmrddriven cancer microenviron evolut next decad focu best effect tailor immunedirect therapi differ mmrd cancer
cancer,"Oral mucositis is a significant side effect of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or their combination in cancer patients. Current clinical management focuses primarily on symptom control, with few effective therapeutic agents. Understanding the factors influencing susceptibility to oral mucositis is essential for a comprehensive grasp of its pathophysiology. This study investigates sex as a biological variable in radiation-induced oral mucositis. Oral mucositis was induced via X-ray ionizing radiation using a fractionated dose of 8 Gy/d for 5 consecutive days, targeting only the head and neck area using male and female C57BL/6J mice aged 7 to 9 wk. Following sex-guided time points, we harvested tongues, stained with toluidine blue, and imaged to visualize mucosal damage. Histopathological analyses were performed using hematoxylin and eosin staining to assess mucositis severity and inflammatory infiltration. All irradiated groups showed a significant increase in mucositis severity versus controls, measured by the total number and area of ulcerative lesions as well as inflammatory cell infiltrate. Notably, there was a significant decrease in epithelial thickness in irradiated mice compared with nonirradiated controls, consistent with oral mucositis. Furthermore, female mice exhibited a greater area of ulcerative lesions and higher inflammatory cell infiltrate scores than males did. This study highlights the sexual dimorphism in the murine model of fractionated ionizing radiation-induced oral mucositis, demonstrating that female mice have an increased susceptibility to irradiation treatment.",oral mucos signific side effect chemotherapi radiotherapi combin cancer patient current clinic manag focus primarili symptom control effect therapeut agent understand factor influenc suscept oral mucos essenti comprehens grasp pathophysiolog studi investig sex biolog variabl radiationinduc oral mucos oral mucos induc via xray ioniz radiat use fraction dose 8 gyd 5 consecut day target head neck area use male femal c57bl6j mice age 7 9 wk follow sexguid time point harvest tongu stain toluidin blue imag visual mucos damag histopatholog analys perform use hematoxylin eosin stain assess mucos sever inflammatori infiltr irradi group show signific increas mucos sever versu control measur total number area ulcer lesion well inflammatori cell infiltr notabl signific decreas epitheli thick irradi mice compar nonirradi control consist oral mucos furthermor femal mice exhibit greater area ulcer lesion higher inflammatori cell infiltr score male studi highlight sexual dimorph murin model fraction ioniz radiationinduc oral mucos demonstr femal mice increas suscept irradi treatment
cancer,"PURPOSE: Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies targeting the PD-1 axis have significantly improved survival in patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC). Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and peripheral T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires are emerging as promising biomarkers for predicting ICB response. Early characterization of ctDNA and TCR dynamics may enable timely treatment adjustments before clinical or radiological progression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The IO-KIN study (NCT04606940) is a single-center, prospective trial involving 15 patients with R/M HNSCC treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. Blood samples (n=104) were collected across seven timepoints from baseline to day 29. ctDNA was analyzed using a personalized assay (Signatera), and peripheral TCR repertoires were profiled using CapTCR-seq in eight patients. RESULTS: A decline in ctDNA after day 8 was associated with radiological response, longer progression-free survival, and a trend toward improved overall survival. TCR repertoires transiently diversified between days 8-22, with longer diversification windows in patients showing sustained ctDNA decline. Using the GLIPHII algorithm, an EBV-specific TCR signature was identified and persisted in patients with clinical benefit. Additional TCR signatures, potentially recognizing tumor-associated antigens, emerged as early as day 3 and were linked to positive outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous early monitoring of ctDNA and TCR dynamics reveals key determinants of ICB outcomes in R/M HNSCC. The transient nature of TCR diversification emphasizes the importance of precise sample timing to guide early therapeutic decisions and improve patient outcomes.",purpos immun checkpoint blockad icb therapi target pd1 axi significantli improv surviv patient recurrentmetastat head neck squamou cell carcinoma rm hnscc circul tumor dna ctdna peripher cell receptor tcr repertoir emerg promis biomark predict icb respons earli character ctdna tcr dynam may enabl time treatment adjust clinic radiolog progress patient method iokin studi nct04606940 singlecent prospect trial involv 15 patient rm hnscc treat nivolumab pembrolizumab blood sampl n104 collect across seven timepoint baselin day 29 ctdna analyz use person assay signatera peripher tcr repertoir profil use captcrseq eight patient result declin ctdna day 8 associ radiolog respons longer progressionfre surviv trend toward improv overal surviv tcr repertoir transient diversifi day 822 longer diversif window patient show sustain ctdna declin use gliphii algorithm ebvspecif tcr signatur identifi persist patient clinic benefit addit tcr signatur potenti recogn tumorassoci antigen emerg earli day 3 link posit outcom conclus simultan earli monitor ctdna tcr dynam reveal key determin icb outcom rm hnscc transient natur tcr diversif emphas import precis sampl time guid earli therapeut decis improv patient outcom
cancer,"PURPOSE: KRAS G12V is among the most frequent KRAS mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet its clinical and molecular features remain poorly understood. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this retrospective study, we analyzed 636 patients with KRAS G12V-mutated NSCLC diagnosed between 2018 and 2023. Clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics, including co-mutations, smoking history, PD-L1 expression, CD8+ T-cell infiltration, and treatment outcomes, were assessed. RESULTS: The majority of patients (94.2%) were current or former smokers, with a median tobacco exposure of 40 pack-years. Co-mutations were frequent, most commonly in TP53 (40.2%), STK11 (30.2%), and KEAP1 (29.3%). Heavy smokers exhibited significantly higher PD-L1 expression and more frequent TP53, KEAP1, and NTRK1-3mutations than light smokers. CD8+ T-cell infiltration showed a non-significant trend toward higher values in G12V compared to non-G12V KRAS subtypes. Among 151 patients with advanced disease, those treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) alone or in combination with chemotherapy had significantly higher response rates and improved real-world progression-free (rwPFS) and overall survival (rwOS) compared to chemotherapy alone. In patients with PD-L1 TPS >/=50%, ICB-based treatment achieved a median rwOS of 30 months. CONCLUSIONS: KRAS G12V-mutated NSCLC is characterized by a strong association with tobacco use, high co-mutation rates in clinically relevant genes, and a favorable response to PD-L1-based immunotherapy. The observed mutation landscape supports the potential for dual checkpoint blockade in a significant subset.",purpos kra g12v among frequent kra mutat nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc yet clinic molecular featur remain poorli understood experiment design retrospect studi analyz 636 patient kra g12vmutat nsclc diagnos 2018 2023 clinic patholog molecular characterist includ comut smoke histori pdl1 express cd8 tcell infiltr treatment outcom assess result major patient 942 current former smoker median tobacco exposur 40 packyear comut frequent commonli tp53 402 stk11 302 keap1 293 heavi smoker exhibit significantli higher pdl1 express frequent tp53 keap1 ntrk13mutat light smoker cd8 tcell infiltr show nonsignific trend toward higher valu g12v compar nong12v kra subtyp among 151 patient advanc diseas treat immun checkpoint blockad icb alon combin chemotherapi significantli higher respons rate improv realworld progressionfre rwpf overal surviv rwo compar chemotherapi alon patient pdl1 tp 50 icbbas treatment achiev median rwo 30 month conclus kra g12vmutat nsclc character strong associ tobacco use high comut rate clinic relev gene favor respons pdl1base immunotherapi observ mutat landscap support potenti dual checkpoint blockad signific subset
cancer,"OBJECTIVES: To examine if military sexual trauma (MST) is associated with the incidence of gynecologic cancers among women Veterans who receive care in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). DESIGN: Data were collected from a retrospective cohort of women who initiated VHA care between 2001 and 2023 and participated for at least 6 months, completed MST screening, and did not have a previous diagnosis of cervical, uterine, or ovarian cancer. We compared women with and without a positive MST screen on demographics, health behaviors, and clinical characteristics. Unadjusted incidence rates of ovarian, uterine, and cervical cancers were calculated overall, and then by MST status. We used Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the associations of MST and gynecological cancer after adjusting for demographics, health behaviors, and clinical variables. PARTICIPANTS: The dataset included 775,464 women. MAIN MEASURES: A history of MST was the primary predictor of interest. Outcomes were first VHA electronic health record documentation of cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancer diagnoses. KEY RESULTS: Women were 40.9 +/- 15.2 years old, 51.4% were non-Hispanic White, and 31.4% had a positive MST screen. Unadjusted incidence rates for the total sample were 45.5, 36.7, and 26.5 per 100,000 person-years for cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancers, respectively. After adjustment, compared to women without documented MST, those with MST had a 25% greater risk of cervical cancer (95% CI 1.17-1.33), a 17% greater risk of uterine cancer (95% CI 1.09-1.27), and a 9% greater risk of ovarian cancer (CI 1.00-1.20). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, a history of MST was associated with an increased incidence of gynecologic cancers.

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and pathological characteristics associated with RAS mutation status and to investigate its prognostic value in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. METHODS: This retrospective study included 446 adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer followed at Dokuz Eylul University Medical Oncology Department between 2010 and 2016, all of whom had available RAS mutation data and complete clinical records. RESULTS: RAS mutations were identified in 44.8% of patients, predominantly KRAS codon 12 mutations. Early-stage disease and absence of metastasis at diagnosis were more common in the RAS wild-type (WT) group (p < 0.001). Lung metastases occurred more frequently in RAS-mutant cases (p = 0.006). No significant difference in overall survival (OS) was observed between RAS-mutant and WT groups (53.6 vs. 52.5 months; p > 0.05). Anti-VEGF therapy conferred a modest OS benefit in RAS-mutant patients, whereas anti-EGFR therapy showed no effect. Among KRAS-mutant subtypes, codon 61 mutations were associated with the poorest OS. CONCLUSION: RAS mutation status may provide insight into metastatic patterns and disease stage in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. However, its impact on overall survival remains inconclusive. Further prospective studies are needed to clarify its prognostic value.",purpos ra mutat play critic role pathogenesi progress colorect cancer studi aim evalu clinic patholog characterist associ ra mutat statu investig prognost valu patient metastat colorect cancer method retrospect studi includ 446 adult patient metastat colorect cancer follow dokuz eylul univers medic oncolog depart 2010 2016 avail ra mutat data complet clinic record result ra mutat identifi 448 patient predominantli kra codon 12 mutat earlystag diseas absenc metastasi diagnosi common ra wildtyp wt group p 0001 lung metastas occur frequent rasmut case p 0006 signific differ overal surviv os observ rasmut wt group 536 vs 525 month p 005 antivegf therapi confer modest os benefit rasmut patient wherea antiegfr therapi show effect among krasmut subtyp codon 61 mutat associ poorest os conclus ra mutat statu may provid insight metastat pattern diseas stage patient metastat colorect cancer howev impact overal surviv remain inconclus prospect studi need clarifi prognost valu

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 19-question online survey, distributed to radiation oncologists worldwide between February and August 2025, assessed UHF adoption, clinical use, barriers, training, and outlook. Chi-square tests compared adoption by institutional type, economic context, and physician experience (p < 0.05). RESULTS: 89 responses from 24 countries were analyzed. Moderate hypofractionation (MHF) predominated (70.8%), followed by UHF (20.2%). Overall, 80.9% had applied UHF, mainly for breast-only cases. Reported barriers included lack of clinical guidelines (49.2%), insufficient training (20.3%), equipment limitations (18.6%), and reimbursement issues (16.9%). No significant differences in adoption were found, though trends showed higher use in academic centers and high-income countries. CONCLUSIONS: UHF is increasingly adopted worldwide, yet MHF remains predominant. Standardizing education, infrastructure, and reimbursement policies could support wider global use.",background studi aim investig global practic pattern barrier physician perspect implement ultrahypofraction radiat therapi uhfrt breast cancer treatment materi method 19question onlin survey distribut radiat oncologist worldwid februari august 2025 assess uhf adopt clinic use barrier train outlook chisquar test compar adopt institut type econom context physician experi p 005 result 89 respons 24 countri analyz moder hypofraction mhf predomin 708 follow uhf 202 overal 809 appli uhf mainli breastonli case report barrier includ lack clinic guidelin 492 insuffici train 203 equip limit 186 reimburs issu 169 signific differ adopt found though trend show higher use academ center highincom countri conclus uhf increasingli adopt worldwid yet mhf remain predomin standard educ infrastructur reimburs polici could support wider global use
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Tumor-infiltrating natural killer (NK) cells are pivotal in modulating tumor progression, either by promoting or inhibiting neoplastic development. Nevertheless, the implications of NK cells in breast carcinoma remain inadequately understood. This investigation aimed to delineate the impact of NK cells on both the prognosis and the immune infiltration landscape in breast cancer. METHODS: NK cell marker genes were identified using single-cell sequencing data from breast cancer available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A prognostic model was constructed based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and subsequently validated with the GEO dataset. Disparities in immune cell infiltration between low-risk and high-risk cohorts, as stratified by the prognostic model, were examined. Additionally, genes differentially expressed between these cohorts were subjected to enrichment analysis. RESULTS: A total of 29 NK cell marker genes were identified through single-cell sequencing, and a prognostic model was subsequently developed using machine learning techniques based on the TCGA data. This model demonstrated robust predictive performance when applied to both TCGA and GEO datasets. Notably, a significant difference in immune infiltration was observed between the low-risk and high-risk groups. The findings were further validated through enrichment analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we constructed a prognostic signature characterized by strong predictive performance, which has elucidated the critical role of NK cells in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Furthermore, this model offers a predictive index and identifies a novel therapeutic target for the advancement of immunotherapeutic strategies in the clinical management of breast cancer patients.",background tumorinfiltr natur killer nk cell pivot modul tumor progress either promot inhibit neoplast develop nevertheless implic nk cell breast carcinoma remain inadequ understood investig aim delin impact nk cell prognosi immun infiltr landscap breast cancer method nk cell marker gene identifi use singlecel sequenc data breast cancer avail gene express omnibu geo databas prognost model construct base data cancer genom atla tcga subsequ valid geo dataset dispar immun cell infiltr lowrisk highrisk cohort stratifi prognost model examin addit gene differenti express cohort subject enrich analysi result total 29 nk cell marker gene identifi singlecel sequenc prognost model subsequ develop use machin learn techniqu base tcga data model demonstr robust predict perform appli tcga geo dataset notabl signific differ immun infiltr observ lowrisk highrisk group find valid enrich analysi conclus summari construct prognost signatur character strong predict perform elucid critic role nk cell pathogenesi breast cancer furthermor model offer predict index identifi novel therapeut target advanc immunotherapeut strategi clinic manag breast cancer patient
cancer,"Effective communication is a critical aspect of cancer care delivery. Specific communication challenges exist for culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) patients and healthcare professionals throughout cancer treatment. This literature review aimed to examine the cancer treatment experience of CALD patients. A systematic scoping review was conducted in January 2025 using the databases; OVID Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central. Search parameters included cancer, cultural diversity, language, and patient experience. Adhering to PRISMA guidelines and an established PICOS framework, 47 articles were selected for review. Exclusion criteria omitted duplicates, non-English language publications, articles published prior to 2010, and those unrelated to oncology and/or CALD communities. Three overarching themes were established from the literature; (1) education & empowerment, (2) quality care provision, and (3) system-level change. Communication barriers impacted the experience of cancer care and compromised treatment outcomes. Translated resources and staff cultural awareness training were observed to be beneficial for CALD patients. There is justified need to improve communication supports and resources for CALD patients and their clinicians. However, radiotherapy (RT) specific research is required to safely implement, contextualise and validate findings - informing bespoke communication improvement opportunities within RT practice.",effect commun critic aspect cancer care deliveri specif commun challeng exist cultur linguist divers cald patient healthcar profession throughout cancer treatment literatur review aim examin cancer treatment experi cald patient systemat scope review conduct januari 2025 use databas ovid medlin embas cochran central search paramet includ cancer cultur divers languag patient experi adher prisma guidelin establish pico framework 47 articl select review exclus criteria omit duplic nonenglish languag public articl publish prior 2010 unrel oncolog andor cald commun three overarch theme establish literatur 1 educ empower 2 qualiti care provis 3 systemlevel chang commun barrier impact experi cancer care compromis treatment outcom translat resourc staff cultur awar train observ benefici cald patient justifi need improv commun support resourc cald patient clinician howev radiotherapi rt specif research requir safe implement contextualis valid find inform bespok commun improv opportun within rt practic
cancer,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are central constituents of the tumor microenvironment (TME), recruited from circulating monocytes through chemotactic signals, and they execute complex, multifaceted functions throughout tumor progression. Functionally heterogeneous, TAMs are broadly classified into distinct subtypes that display a dynamic duality, capable of shifting between tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting states, though the pro-tumorigenic functions tend to dominate across multiple cancer types. The polarization of TAMs is modulated by diverse cytokines and signaling networks within the TME. Key pro-tumor mechanisms include activating proliferative signaling pathways, enhancing invasive and metastatic potential, establishing an immunosuppressive TME through immune cell interactions, and conferring therapy resistance. The spatial heterogeneity of TAMs further underscores the predictive relevance. Translational research increasingly focuses on TAM-targeting strategies such as inhibiting recruitment, depleting subsets, or reprogramming function. Emerging approaches, including nanomedicine-based targeting, macrophage-mediated therapies, and novel drug formulations, highlight the importance of combining conventional treatments with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Such combinations help overcome therapeutic resistance and improve clinical outcomes. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in TAM biology and plasticity, biomarkers from single-cell and spatial analyses for distinguishing TAM subsets, and their prognostic relevance in immunotherapy. It also discusses TAM-targeting strategies and their synergistic potential with existing therapies. Together, these insights lay the foundation for next-generation cancer treatments that precisely target TAMs to overcome therapy resistance and improve patient survival.",tumorassoci macrophag tam central constitu tumor microenviron tme recruit circul monocyt chemotact signal execut complex multifacet function throughout tumor progress function heterogen tam broadli classifi distinct subtyp display dynam dualiti capabl shift tumorsuppress tumorpromot state though protumorigen function tend domin across multipl cancer type polar tam modul divers cytokin signal network within tme key protumor mechan includ activ prolif signal pathway enhanc invas metastat potenti establish immunosuppress tme immun cell interact confer therapi resist spatial heterogen tam underscor predict relev translat research increasingli focus tamtarget strategi inhibit recruit deplet subset reprogram function emerg approach includ nanomedicinebas target macrophagemedi therapi novel drug formul highlight import combin convent treatment immun checkpoint inhibitor ici combin help overcom therapeut resist improv clinic outcom review systemat summar recent advanc tam biolog plastic biomark singlecel spatial analys distinguish tam subset prognost relev immunotherapi also discuss tamtarget strategi synergist potenti exist therapi togeth insight lay foundat nextgener cancer treatment precis target tam overcom therapi resist improv patient surviv
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide, with a poor overall survival rate. Liquid biopsy (LB) is a non-invasive approach that can assist with the diagnosis and dynamic monitoring of GC. The aim of this study is to use bibliometric analysis to evaluate global trends in LB of GC from 2000 to 2025 and visualise the frontiers. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on Web of Science for studies on LB in GC published between 2000 and 2025. The retrieved articles were analysed using descriptive statistics and visualisation to examine the annual publication number, prolific countries and institutions, influential authors and journals, and the number of citations. RESULTS: A total of 360 publications were identified, showing consistent growth in output from 2002 to 2025, with a notable acceleration around 2016. Ichikawa D was the most prolific author, contributing 8 publications and amassing 338 citations, which highlights his significant academic impact. China led in terms of publication output with 146 publications, followed closely by the USA and Japan. Journals such as Cancers and Frontiers in Oncology occupied central positions in the network, reflecting their interdisciplinary significance. Frequent key terms such as LB, GC, biomarker and circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) emphasised the focus on diagnostic applications and molecular targets in research. CONCLUSIONS: The field of liquid biopsy for GC is entering a period of rapid development. This bibliometric analysis maps the fundamental knowledge structure of this field.

cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are endogenous non-coding RNAs implicated in the initiation and progression of cancer. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network exerts a crucial influence on tumor prognosis and therapy. This research aimed to identify novel circRNA-driven ceRNA networks and potential prognostic/therapeutic targets for gastric cancer (GC). METHODS: Gastric cancer-related circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA datasets were retrieved from the GEO database, accompanied by clinical and expression data from TCGA. Differential expression analysis, ceRNA network construction (Cytoscape_v3.8.0), KEGG/GO enrichment analysis, and survival analyses were conducted using R software. RESULTS: KEGG analysis of mRNAs within the ceRNA network indicated enrichment in the IL-17 signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, and other pathways associated with GC prognosis. Two key ceRNA axes associated with GC prognosis were identified: (1) hsa_circ_0055521/hsa-miR-204-5p/FAP and (2) (hsa_circ_0005051, hsa_circ_0007613, hsa_circ_0045602, hsa_circ_0034398, hsa_circ_0006089)/hsa-miR-32-3p/FNDC1. Survival analysis and immunohistochemical validation (HPA database) verified that FAP and FNDC1 are potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for GC. CONCLUSION: This study identifies three key pathways, two novel prognostic ceRNA networks, six prognosis-related circRNAs, and two target genes (FAP/FNDC1) for GC, offering new directions for GC therapy.",object circular rna circrna endogen noncod rna implic initi progress cancer circrnamirnamrna competit endogen rna cerna network exert crucial influenc tumor prognosi therapi research aim identifi novel circrnadriven cerna network potenti prognostictherapeut target gastric cancer gc method gastric cancerrel circrna mirna mrna dataset retriev geo databas accompani clinic express data tcga differenti express analysi cerna network construct cytoscapev380 kegggo enrich analysi surviv analys conduct use r softwar result kegg analysi mrna within cerna network indic enrich il17 signal pathway tnf signal pathway pathway associ gc prognosi two key cerna axe associ gc prognosi identifi 1 hsacirc0055521hsamir2045pfap 2 hsacirc0005051 hsacirc0007613 hsacirc0045602 hsacirc0034398 hsacirc0006089hsamir323pfndc1 surviv analysi immunohistochem valid hpa databas verifi fap fndc1 potenti prognost biomark therapeut target gc conclus studi identifi three key pathway two novel prognost cerna network six prognosisrel circrna two target gene fapfndc1 gc offer new direct gc therapi

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Prostate biopsy is the recommended diagnostic test for prostate cancer in patients with abnormal findings on digital rectal examinations (DRE) or elevated PSA (prostate-specific antigen) levels. Biopsies can cause severe anxiety and pain. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of music and conversation on pain and anxiety in patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective trial at a Tertiary University Hospital in Turkiye. METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted. Ninety patients who had abnormal findings on DRE and/or a PSA value greater than 2.5 ng/ml and were scheduled to undergo TRUS-PBx were randomly assigned to one of three groups (n = 30) via the sealed envelope randomization method: control, music, and conversation groups. VAS pain, VAS anxiety, and STAI scores were recorded before and after the procedure. Statistical analysis was performed using One-Way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Pairwise comparison tests were conducted for the parameters that yielded significant differences among the control, conversation, and music groups. For all statistical analyses, a P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Conversation reduced pain and anxiety significantly (P < 0.001 and P = 0.01 respectively). Post-Bx VAS pain and STAI-State scores were lower in the conversation group. Pairwise comparisons revealed significant differences between the music and conversation groups (VAS pain, P < 0.001; STAI-State, P = 0.006). However, pain and STAI-State scores were similar in both the groups (VAS pain P = 0.645; STAI-State P = 0.597). CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that listening to music had no significant effect on pain and anxiety in patients undergoing TRUS-PBx. Conversely, the findings showed that engaging patients in conversation significantly reduced pain and anxiety during the procedure.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: The Psychological Inflexibility in Pain Scale (PIPS) was developed to measure avoidance and cognitive fusion. OBJECTIVES: To translate, cross-culturally adapt, and analyze the measurement properties of the Psychological Inflexibility in Pain Scale (PIPS) in Brazilian patients with chronic cancer pain. METHODS: Questionnaire translation, cross-cultural adaptation, and validation studies were conducted in two hospitals in northeastern Brazil. The measurement properties tested included structural validity, construct validity, reliability, and internal consistency. The following assessment instruments were used in addition to the PIPS: Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), Barthel Index, Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 122 patients, most of whom were women (65.6%) with a mean age of 49 years. Most patients had uterine cancer (23%) and leukemia (9.8%). We identified problems in the two-dimensional structure of the PIPS by presenting three inadequate fit indices. Adequate reliability was observed in both domains. Regarding the avoidance domain, there was a correlation with a magnitude > 0.30 with the depression domain of the HADS, and correlations with a magnitude < 0.30 with the anxiety domain of the HADS, the PCS domains, and the Barthel Index. The cognitive fusion domain did not correlate with any of these scales (P > 0.05). No ceiling or floor effects were observed. CONCLUSION: The Brazilian version of the PIPS is reliable; however, the instrument does not have a valid internal structure and the cognitive fusion domain is not a valid construct.",background psycholog inflex pain scale pip develop measur avoid cognit fusion object translat crosscultur adapt analyz measur properti psycholog inflex pain scale pip brazilian patient chronic cancer pain method questionnair translat crosscultur adapt valid studi conduct two hospit northeastern brazil measur properti test includ structur valid construct valid reliabl intern consist follow assess instrument use addit pip pain catastroph scale pc barthel index edmonton symptom assess scale esa hospit anxieti depress scale had result studi sampl consist 122 patient women 656 mean age 49 year patient uterin cancer 23 leukemia 98 identifi problem twodimension structur pip present three inadequ fit indic adequ reliabl observ domain regard avoid domain correl magnitud 030 depress domain had correl magnitud 030 anxieti domain had pc domain barthel index cognit fusion domain correl scale p 005 ceil floor effect observ conclus brazilian version pip reliabl howev instrument valid intern structur cognit fusion domain valid construct

cancer,"OBJECTIVE: The prognosis of metastatic breast cancer has improved with new targeted therapies like cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors. Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, such as direct renin inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are frequently used to manage hypertension and heart failure. However, recent research indicates that they may also provide potential benefits in cancer therapy. The combination of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors is an emerging area of interest in cancer research. Our hypotesis that, by inhibiting angiogenesis, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors may reduce tumor growth and improve the effectiveness of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors by cutting off the supply of nutrients and oxygen to the tumor. METHODS: Metastatic breast cancer patients treated with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors were enrolled and retrospectively divided according to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker use: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker (+) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker (-). Progression-free survival and overall survival were defined as primary and secondary endpoints. The effect of categorized data on progression-free survival and overall survival was determined by Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: Estimated median progression-free survival (HR 0.61, 95%CI 0.34-0.94; p = 0.041) and overall survival (HR 0.71, 95%CI 0.49-0.79; p: 0.01) were statistically significantly longer in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker (+) group than in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker (-) group. CONCLUSION: Concomitant use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors may have beneficial oncological effects in patients with breast cancer beyond their cardiovascular indications.",object prognosi metastat breast cancer improv new target therapi like cyclindepend kinas 46 inhibitor reninangiotensin system inhibitor direct renin inhibitor angiotensin ii receptor blocker angiotensinconvert enzym inhibitor frequent use manag hypertens heart failur howev recent research indic may also provid potenti benefit cancer therapi combin reninangiotensin system inhibitor cyclindepend kinas 46 inhibitor emerg area interest cancer research hypotesi inhibit angiogenesi reninangiotensin system inhibitor may reduc tumor growth improv effect cyclindepend kinas 46 inhibitor cut suppli nutrient oxygen tumor method metastat breast cancer patient treat cyclindepend kinas 46 inhibitor enrol retrospect divid accord angiotensinconvert enzym inhibitorangiotensin ii receptor blocker use angiotensinconvert enzym inhibitorangiotensin ii receptor blocker angiotensinconvert enzym inhibitorangiotensin ii receptor blocker progressionfre surviv overal surviv defin primari secondari endpoint effect categor data progressionfre surviv overal surviv determin cox regress analys result estim median progressionfre surviv hr 061 95ci 034094 p 0041 overal surviv hr 071 95ci 049079 p 001 statist significantli longer angiotensinconvert enzym inhibitorangiotensin ii receptor blocker group angiotensinconvert enzym inhibitorangiotensin ii receptor blocker group conclus concomit use reninangiotensin system inhibitor cyclindepend kinas 46 inhibitor may benefici oncolog effect patient breast cancer beyond cardiovascular indic

RESULTS: Among 15,901 lung cancer patients, 177 had CPA and 135 had PJP. The pooled prevalence was 1% for CPA and 23% for PJP. CPA was significantly associated with male sex, smoking, COPD, interstitial lung disease, tuberculosis, and squamous cell carcinoma, and negatively associated with adenocarcinoma. CPA patients also had significantly lower BMI. Bilobectomy, radiotherapy, and concurrent chemoradiotherapy were additional risk factors for CPA. High-dose corticosteroid use (>/=20 mg/day) was significantly associated with PJP. CONCLUSION: CPA occurs in a clinically distinct subset of lung cancer patients with identifiable risk factors, while PJP appears to be strongly linked to immunosuppressive therapy. Improved screening strategies are warranted to mitigate the burden of these infections in vulnerable lung cancer populations.",object fungal pulmonari infect signific complic lung cancer advers affect prognosi treatment outcom metaanalysi aim estim preval chronic pulmonari aspergillosi cpa pneumocysti jirovecii pneumonia pjp lung cancer patient identifi associ clinic predictor method systemat search ebscohost embas pubmedmedlin scopu web scienc retriev 2823 record 7 studi elig prospero crd42024551104 metaanalys proport dichotom continu variabl perform use r meta packag via jamovi revman 5 statist signific set p005 result among 15901 lung cancer patient 177 cpa 135 pjp pool preval 1 cpa 23 pjp cpa significantli associ male sex smoke copd interstiti lung diseas tuberculosi squamou cell carcinoma neg associ adenocarcinoma cpa patient also significantli lower bmi bilobectomi radiotherapi concurr chemoradiotherapi addit risk factor cpa highdos corticosteroid use 20 mgday significantli associ pjp conclus cpa occur clinic distinct subset lung cancer patient identifi risk factor pjp appear strongli link immunosuppress therapi improv screen strategi warrant mitig burden infect vulner lung cancer popul
cancer,"BACKGROUND: The analysis of tumor budding (TB) and its prognostic value in gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) has been the focus of several studies, with inconsistent results. This parameter is not included in gastric prognostic classifications or standardized pathological reports. AIMS: To evaluate TB in GA and its prognostic significance through survival analysis, in addition to investigating the association between TB and clinicopathological markers that are considered prognostic factors for this type of cancer. METHODS: This retrospective study covers a period of ten years, from January 2008 to December 2017. It included patients who underwent surgery for GA. TB evaluation followed the 2016 consensus guidelines for colorectal cancer, with three grades: Bd1 (0-4 buds), Bd2 (5-9 buds), and Bd3 (10 or more buds). Additionally, a two-grade classification system was employed, distinguishing between low-grade budding (fewer than 10 buds) and high-grade budding (10 or more buds). RESULTS: TB was classified as low-grade in 69% of the cases and high-grade in 31%. High-grade TB was significantly correlated with perineural invasion (HR [hazard ratio]: 2.98, 95%CI [95% confidence interval] 1.04-8.53, p=0.004), stages III and IV (HR 4.04, 95%CI 1.27-12.83, p=0.01), and mortality (HR 3.65, 95%CI 1.24-10.74, p=0.02). It was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival (RFS) (p=0.005, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that TB prognostic and predictive value in GA is significant, particularly regarding patient survival.",background analysi tumor bud tb prognost valu gastric adenocarcinoma ga focu sever studi inconsist result paramet includ gastric prognost classif standard patholog report aim evalu tb ga prognost signific surviv analysi addit investig associ tb clinicopatholog marker consid prognost factor type cancer method retrospect studi cover period ten year januari 2008 decemb 2017 includ patient underw surgeri ga tb evalu follow 2016 consensu guidelin colorect cancer three grade bd1 04 bud bd2 59 bud bd3 10 bud addit twograd classif system employ distinguish lowgrad bud fewer 10 bud highgrad bud 10 bud result tb classifi lowgrad 69 case highgrad 31 highgrad tb significantli correl perineur invas hr hazard ratio 298 95ci 95 confid interv 104853 p0004 stage iii iv hr 404 95ci 1271283 p001 mortal hr 365 95ci 1241074 p002 independ prognost factor recurrencefre surviv rf p0005 p005 conclus demonstr tb prognost predict valu ga signific particularli regard patient surviv
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Drosophila melanogaster, a well-established model organism in biomedical research, has significantly advanced our understanding of genetic mechanisms underlying human diseases. Its genetic similarity to humans, with approximately 75% of human disease-related genes having orthologues in the fly genome, renders it a valuable tool for studying complex conditions like cancer. The organism's low cost, short life cycle, and manipulable genome make it ideal for high-throughput studies. MAIN TEXT: Recent advances have enabled the use of Drosophila as a model for different cancer types, including colorectal, thyroid, lung, and brain cancers. These models replicate key tumor characteristics such as cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Drosophila's utility in drug screening has been exemplified through heterochromatin-promoting assays and personalized medicine approaches using patient-specific gene expression data. Its role in testing therapeutic combinations, such as MEK inhibitors with statins for lung cancer, underscores its translational potential. Despite its utility, the model has notable limitations. Differences in tumor biology between flies and humans, especially regarding organ systems and immune responses, limit its applicability in certain cancer types and metastatic studies. Furthermore, environmental influences and the simplified genetic background of Drosophila may not accurately represent human cancer complexity. Ethical concerns and translational challenges also exist, warranting cautious interpretation of results. The recent advancements in CRISPR-based genome editing, particularly cytosine and adenine base editors, have improved gene-editing efficiency in Drosophila, supporting its ongoing use in precision oncology. Future directions point toward integrating Drosophila models with other in vivo and in silico systems to optimize personalized drug discovery and better emulate human tumor heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: While the use of Drosophila melanogaster has intrinsic limitations, its genetic tractability and compatibility with cutting-edge genomic tools position it as a complementary model to mammalian systems. Continued innovations in genetic engineering and model integration will further strengthen its role in translational oncology and precision medicine. This review explores the applications of the model in human cancer research and highlights the major challenges with its use. This is crucial for the fight against cancer, as it helps inform researchers of the potential areas that require further research, especially with the rapid evolution of personalised medicine.",introduct drosophila melanogast wellestablish model organ biomed research significantli advanc understand genet mechan underli human diseas genet similar human approxim 75 human diseaserel gene orthologu fli genom render valuabl tool studi complex condit like cancer organ low cost short life cycl manipul genom make ideal highthroughput studi main text recent advanc enabl use drosophila model differ cancer type includ colorect thyroid lung brain cancer model replic key tumor characterist cell prolifer invas metastasi drosophila util drug screen exemplifi heterochromatinpromot assay person medicin approach use patientspecif gene express data role test therapeut combin mek inhibitor statin lung cancer underscor translat potenti despit util model notabl limit differ tumor biolog fli human especi regard organ system immun respons limit applic certain cancer type metastat studi furthermor environment influenc simplifi genet background drosophila may accur repres human cancer complex ethic concern translat challeng also exist warrant cautiou interpret result recent advanc crisprbas genom edit particularli cytosin adenin base editor improv geneedit effici drosophila support ongo use precis oncolog futur direct point toward integr drosophila model vivo silico system optim person drug discoveri better emul human tumor heterogen conclus use drosophila melanogast intrins limit genet tractabl compat cuttingedg genom tool posit complementari model mammalian system continu innov genet engin model integr strengthen role translat oncolog precis medicin review explor applic model human cancer research highlight major challeng use crucial fight cancer help inform research potenti area requir research especi rapid evolut personalis medicin
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Early detection of precancerous lesions such as adenomas and polyps is vital for prevention, yet standard colonoscopy may miss up to 26% of adenomas. Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted colonoscopy has emerged as a promising tool to enhance lesion detection. This meta-analysis provides an updated synthesis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the diagnostic performance of AI-assisted versus standard colonoscopy. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search of PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus identified 38 RCTs including 29,745 participants. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses by geographical region and AI manufacturer were performed to explore heterogeneity. Certainty of evidence was rated using the GRADE approach, and publication bias was assessed through funnel plots and Egger's test. RESULTS: AI-assisted colonoscopy significantly improved adenoma detection rate (ADR: RR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.14-1.25) and polyp detection rate (PDR: RR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.13-1.25), while reducing adenoma miss rate (AMR: RR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.38-0.72) and polyp miss rate (PMR: RR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.33-0.88). The mean number of adenomas per colonoscopy increased (MD = 0.20, 95% CI 0.14-0.25). AI modestly prolonged withdrawal time (MD = 0.46 min, 95% CI 0.26-0.66). No significant difference was observed for carcinoma detection (RR = 1.12) or advanced adenoma miss rate (RR = 0.67). Sessile serrated lesion detection showed a nonsignificant trend toward improvement (RR = 1.13), becoming significant after outlier exclusion (RR = 1.23). Subgroup analyses revealed higher ADR improvement in East Asian studies and with specific AI systems (e.g., Wision AI). Egger's test suggested minor small-study effects for ADR and withdrawal time. CONCLUSIONS: AI-assisted colonoscopy substantially enhances adenoma and polyp detection while reducing miss rates. However, its benefit for carcinoma and sessile serrated lesion detection remains uncertain. Further standardized RCTs with long-term follow-up are warranted to confirm its role in colorectal cancer screening.",background colorect cancer crc remain lead caus cancerrel mortal worldwid earli detect precancer lesion adenoma polyp vital prevent yet standard colonoscopi may miss 26 adenoma artifici intellig aiassist colonoscopi emerg promis tool enhanc lesion detect metaanalysi provid updat synthesi random control trial rct evalu diagnost perform aiassist versu standard colonoscopi method follow prisma guidelin comprehens search pubm cochran web scienc scopu identifi 38 rct includ 29745 particip pool risk ratio rr mean differ md 95 confid interv ci calcul use randomeffect model subgroup analys geograph region ai manufactur perform explor heterogen certainti evid rate use grade approach public bia assess funnel plot egger test result aiassist colonoscopi significantli improv adenoma detect rate adr rr 119 95 ci 114125 polyp detect rate pdr rr 119 95 ci 113125 reduc adenoma miss rate amr rr 052 95 ci 038072 polyp miss rate pmr rr 053 95 ci 033088 mean number adenoma per colonoscopi increas md 020 95 ci 014025 ai modestli prolong withdraw time md 046 min 95 ci 026066 signific differ observ carcinoma detect rr 112 advanc adenoma miss rate rr 067 sessil serrat lesion detect show nonsignific trend toward improv rr 113 becom signific outlier exclus rr 123 subgroup analys reveal higher adr improv east asian studi specif ai system eg wision ai egger test suggest minor smallstudi effect adr withdraw time conclus aiassist colonoscopi substanti enhanc adenoma polyp detect reduc miss rate howev benefit carcinoma sessil serrat lesion detect remain uncertain standard rct longterm followup warrant confirm role colorect cancer screen
cancer,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) significantly impairs a person's physical and psychological health despite active treatment efforts. Thus, it is important to investigate the pathogenesis of OSCC to discover new therapeutic targets for clinical treatments. ORAI3 is a store-operated calcium (Ca(2+)) channel that has been associated with several cancers, including breast, prostate, and pancreas. Although the ORAI3 channel is recognized for its oncogenic potential, its pathological functions in OSCC are not well understood, especially concerning its involvement in cancer progression. In this study, we found that ORAI3 was upregulated in OSCC clinical samples and cell lines. When the expression of ORAI3 was knocked down in vitro in OSCC cells, store-operated calcium entry-mediated Ca(2+) influx into the cells was reduced. Importantly, the proliferation, migration, and invasive capabilities of these OSCC cells were also markedly decreased. Application of calmodulin or calcineurin inhibitors (W-7 or CsA, respectively) further suppressed these cell functions. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that ORAI3 knockdown led to downregulation of ETV4, a member of the ETS transcription factor family that is involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis and has been shown to be upregulated in some types of cancer. Here, overexpression of ETV4 rescued the suppressive effects on the proliferation, migration, and invasive capabilities of OSCC cells caused by ORAI3 knockdown. In addition, treatment with the calcineurin inhibitor CsA markedly reduced ETV4 expression levels in OSCC cells. Taken together, these results indicated that ORAI3 drives cancer progression by activating the Ca(2+)/calmodulin/calcineurin/ETV4 signaling pathway. Overall, these findings suggest that ORAI3/ETV4 may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of OSCC.",oral squamou cell carcinoma oscc significantli impair person physic psycholog health despit activ treatment effort thu import investig pathogenesi oscc discov new therapeut target clinic treatment orai3 storeoper calcium ca2 channel associ sever cancer includ breast prostat pancrea although orai3 channel recogn oncogen potenti patholog function oscc well understood especi concern involv cancer progress studi found orai3 upregul oscc clinic sampl cell line express orai3 knock vitro oscc cell storeoper calcium entrymedi ca2 influx cell reduc importantli prolifer migrat invas capabl oscc cell also markedli decreas applic calmodulin calcineurin inhibitor w7 csa respect suppress cell function transcriptom analysi reveal orai3 knockdown led downregul etv4 member et transcript factor famili involv cell differenti prolifer apoptosi shown upregul type cancer overexpress etv4 rescu suppress effect prolifer migrat invas capabl oscc cell caus orai3 knockdown addit treatment calcineurin inhibitor csa markedli reduc etv4 express level oscc cell taken togeth result indic orai3 drive cancer progress activ ca2calmodulincalcineurinetv4 signal pathway overal find suggest orai3etv4 may therapeut target treatment oscc
cancer,"Berberine (BBR) is a traditional Chinese medicine which has been extensively utilized in treating various diseases. By cyclizing the 8- and 9-positions of berberine, a novel derivative, 2,3-dimethyldioxy-9-methyl-11-methoxy-8,10-cycloberberine chloride (BN-7), was synthesized for the first time. Its anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities, as well as acute toxicity profile, were also evaluated. BN-7 demonstrated potent antiproliferative activity, effectively suppressing the growth of two non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines through paraptosis. It also significantly inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 and THP-1 cells. Furthermore, acute toxicity studies following intravenous administration revealed that the median lethal dose (LD(50)) of BN-7 was 7.42 mg/kg (95% CI: 6.09-9.15) in Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice; and 11.82 mg/kg (95% CI: 9.80-14.43) in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. No significant changes were found in mortality, behavior, body weight, organ coefficients, or pathological observation at the dose of 5.25 mg/kg. Therefore, our findings provide novel insights into BN-7, indicating its potential as an anticancer and anti-inflammatory agent.",berberin bbr tradit chines medicin extens util treat variou diseas cycliz 8 9posit berberin novel deriv 23dimethyldioxy9methyl11methoxy810cycloberberin chlorid bn7 synthes first time anticanc antiinflammatori activ well acut toxic profil also evalu bn7 demonstr potent antiprolif activ effect suppress growth two nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc cell line paraptosi also significantli inhibit product proinflammatori cytokin lpsstimul raw2647 thp1 cell furthermor acut toxic studi follow intraven administr reveal median lethal dose ld50 bn7 742 mgkg 95 ci 609915 institut cancer research icr mice 1182 mgkg 95 ci 9801443 spragu dawley sd rat signific chang found mortal behavior bodi weight organ coeffici patholog observ dose 525 mgkg therefor find provid novel insight bn7 indic potenti anticanc antiinflammatori agent
cancer,"Cure rates for childhood malignancies using established therapy protocols have increased to an average of 80% but have reached a plateau. Moreover, survival rates are particularly low for some pediatric tumors-such as high-risk group 3 medulloblastomas, osteosarcomas, Ewing sarcomas, high-risk neuroblastomas, and high-grade gliomas-and dismal for patients with relapsed malignancies. A functional drug response profiling platform for pediatric solid and brain tumors has been established within the INFORM program to identify patient-specific vulnerabilities and biomarkers and to unravel molecular mechanisms associated with drug response profiles for clinical translation. In this study, we performed a multiomics analysis using drug sensitivity profiles, as well as genomic and transcriptomic data, of 81 pediatric solid tumor samples. The integrative analysis suggested two multiomics signatures associated with drug sensitivity. One signature distinguished neuroblastoma samples with sensitivity to navitoclax, a BCL2 family inhibitor. A second signature was specific to a subset of Wilms tumors harboring the SIX1 (Q177R) hotspot mutation that displayed high expression of MGAM, PTPN14, STAT4, and KDM2B and high sensitivity to MEK inhibitors. A patient-specific causal interaction network analysis suggested possible molecular interactions between MEK inhibitors and the SIX1 mutation in Wilms tumor samples. In conclusion, the integration of drug sensitivity profiling and multiomics data revealed potential biomarkers that may be associated with drug sensitivity in pediatric solid tumors. Patient-specific causal interaction network analysis further elucidated the interaction between inhibitors and signature biomarkers, providing insights that may inform clinical translation. SIGNIFICANCE: The combination of multiomics analysis and drug sensitivity profiling identified two signatures related to drug sensitivity in pediatric solid tumors, contributing to the advancement of functional precision medicine and personalized treatment strategies.

cancer,"Exosomes play a crucial role in the transmission of drug resistance in tumors. However, the mechanism of exosomes-mediated transmission in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) under gefitinib treatment remains limited. In this work, we demonstrated that exosomes derived from HCC827/GR cells (drug-resistant) enhanced the survivability of HCC827 cells (drug-sensitive) under treatment with gefitinib. A total of 157 shared upregulated proteins between exosomes and their parent cells were identified in the comparison of the gefitinib-resistant groups versus the gefitinib-sensitive groups. Notably, 69 of these shared proteins are enzymes, and many of them were enriched in pathways related to fatty acid metabolism. Among these enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism, ACC1 exhibited the highest fold change in upregulated expression in both drug-resistant groups (exosomes and cells). Moreover, the expression of ACC1 was upregulated in gefitinib-sensitive cells after uptake of exosomes from gefitinib-resistant cells. The role of ACC1 in enhancing the survival of HCC827/GR cells under gefitinib treatment was demonstrated using an inhibitor and siRNA-mediated knockdown. Specifically, the upregulated ACC1 stabilized fatty acid oxidation and reactive oxygen species levels in HCC827/GR cells, thereby maintaining cellular metabolic homeostasis. Collectively, this work reveals the transmission of drug resistance in NSCLC via exosomes that carry the ACC1 protein.",exosom play crucial role transmiss drug resist tumor howev mechan exosomesmedi transmiss nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc gefitinib treatment remain limit work demonstr exosom deriv hcc827gr cell drugresist enhanc surviv hcc827 cell drugsensit treatment gefitinib total 157 share upregul protein exosom parent cell identifi comparison gefitinibresist group versu gefitinibsensit group notabl 69 share protein enzym mani enrich pathway relat fatti acid metabol among enzym involv fatti acid metabol acc1 exhibit highest fold chang upregul express drugresist group exosom cell moreov express acc1 upregul gefitinibsensit cell uptak exosom gefitinibresist cell role acc1 enhanc surviv hcc827gr cell gefitinib treatment demonstr use inhibitor sirnamedi knockdown specif upregul acc1 stabil fatti acid oxid reactiv oxygen speci level hcc827gr cell therebi maintain cellular metabol homeostasi collect work reveal transmiss drug resist nsclc via exosom carri acc1 protein
cancer,"Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature, is essential for tissue homeostasis, development, and repair. Dysregulation of this tightly regulated process contributes to a wide range of diseases, including cancer, ischemic disorders, and chronic inflammatory conditions. This review focuses on the secreted frizzled-related protein (SFRP) family, a group of pivotal yet underappreciated regulators of neovascularization. We discuss the tissue-specific expression patterns, regulatory mechanisms, and functional roles of SFRPs in both physiological and pathological vascular remodeling. Particular attention is given to their interactions with key signaling pathways, including Wnt, highlighting their context-dependent effects on angiogenesis. Drawing on extensive preclinical evidence, we position SFRPs as novel regulators of vascular remodeling and explore their potential as promising targets for therapeutic intervention. This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of further mechanistic and clinical studies to unlock the therapeutic potential of SFRPs in vascular pathologies.",angiogenesi format new blood vessel preexist vasculatur essenti tissu homeostasi develop repair dysregul tightli regul process contribut wide rang diseas includ cancer ischem disord chronic inflammatori condit review focus secret frizzledrel protein sfrp famili group pivot yet underappreci regul neovascular discuss tissuespecif express pattern regulatori mechan function role sfrp physiolog patholog vascular remodel particular attent given interact key signal pathway includ wnt highlight contextdepend effect angiogenesi draw extens preclin evid posit sfrp novel regul vascular remodel explor potenti promis target therapeut intervent comprehens analysi underscor import mechanist clinic studi unlock therapeut potenti sfrp vascular patholog
cancer,"In preclinical models, optimum tumor control by radiation therapy incorporates CD8 T cell control of residual cancer cells. Tumor control by these CD8 T cells is negatively regulated by myeloid and T regulatory cell expansions in the tumor following radiation treatment. We demonstrate using ex vivo 3D tumor models and novel in vivo cell tracking models that radiation results in upregulation of the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 on tumor macrophages and on monocytes that enter the tumor following radiation. This regulation of CD80 is not dependent on adjuvant signaling via MyD88 or STING in the myeloid cells. While we would anticipate that CD80 and CD86 would have a positive impact on anti-tumor immunity, we demonstrate that blockade of CD80 and CD86 signaling limits CD4 infiltrates in tumors and prevents the Treg expansion caused by radiation treatment. Importantly, this treatment results in improved tumor control following radiation therapy. These data link the inflammatory activation of myeloid cells in irradiated tumors to the Treg expansion following radiation and ensuing suppression of anti-tumor immunity.",preclin model optimum tumor control radiat therapi incorpor cd8 cell control residu cancer cell tumor control cd8 cell neg regul myeloid regulatori cell expans tumor follow radiat treatment demonstr use ex vivo 3d tumor model novel vivo cell track model radiat result upregul costimulatori molecul cd80 cd86 tumor macrophag monocyt enter tumor follow radiat regul cd80 depend adjuv signal via myd88 sting myeloid cell would anticip cd80 cd86 would posit impact antitumor immun demonstr blockad cd80 cd86 signal limit cd4 infiltr tumor prevent treg expans caus radiat treatment importantli treatment result improv tumor control follow radiat therapi data link inflammatori activ myeloid cell irradi tumor treg expans follow radiat ensu suppress antitumor immun
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Behavioural speech therapy (BST) is a non-drug treatment for chronic cough. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of behavioural speech therapy based on the transtheoretical model on chronic cough and quality of life in lung cancer patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery. METHODS: In this prospective randomized controlled trial, patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either the BST intervention or standard care every 2 weeks for 3 months after surgery. The primary outcomes included the prevalence and severity of chronic cough; the secondary outcomes included cough-related quality of life, anxiety and depression. Data were collected at admission (T0), 1 month post-surgery (T1), and 3 months post-surgery (T2). A mixed-effects model was used to assess changes across time points and outcomes. The study was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registration (ChiCTR2400084313; May 14, 2024). RESULTS: Between July and September 2024, we enrolled 112 patients for baseline assessment (57 patients in the intervention group and 55 patients in the control group). The prevalence of chronic cough was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (21.1% vs. 43.6%, adjusted RR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.19-0.64; P < 0.05). The mean difference in cough score was 4.11 (95% CI: -5.33 to -2.89; P < 0.001) lower in the BST group than in the control group from baseline to T2. The cough-related health scores of the intervention group were better than those of the control group in all dimensions after 1 month and 3 months. The mean differences in anxiety and depression in the BST group were greater than those in the control group from baseline to T2.

cancer,"High levels of replication stress make cancer cells vulnerable to therapies targeting DNA damage response (DDR) proteins, such as ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) protein kinase. ATR is a key mediator of the replication stress response and plays a vital role in maintaining genomic stability. This study investigates the immunomodulatory potential of the ATR inhibitor (ATRi) tuvusertib to improve the targeting of prostate cancer (PCa) by immunotherapy. Tuvusertib pretreatment sensitized human PCa cells (DU145 and 22Rv1) to PBMC-derived natural killer (NK)-mediated lysis. Flow cytometric analysis identified upregulation of death receptor tumor-necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2), NKG2D ligand ULBP-1, and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) as a potential immunomodulatory effect of tuvusertib. Enhanced avelumab-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and lysis by PD-L1 targeting high-affinity NK (PD-L1 t-haNK) cells were observed in tuvusertib-treated DU145. Tuvusertib sensitized cells to lysis by recombinant human TRAIL, and TRAIL signaling blockade reduced NK-mediated lysis of tuvusertib-exposed cells. RNA analysis revealed elevated p21 and reduced Bcl-xL transcript levels in tuvusertib-treated DU145, suggesting an accumulation of DNA damage and suppression of anti-apoptotic signaling, respectively. Pretreatment of NK cells with the interleukin-15 (IL-15) receptor superagonist N-803 (nogapendekin alfa inbakicept) further enhaced the lysis of tuvusertib-exposed cells. In vivo in the DU145 PCa xenograft model, tuvusertib and N-803 combination therapy demonstrated marked and significant antitumor efficacy relative to either monotherapy, eliciting superior tumor growth control and prolonging survival. Our findings support further investigation into the use of ATRi with immune checkpoint blockade and/or immune-stimulating agents in prostate cancer.",high level replic stress make cancer cell vulner therapi target dna damag respons ddr protein ataxia telangiectasia rad3rel atr protein kinas atr key mediat replic stress respons play vital role maintain genom stabil studi investig immunomodulatori potenti atr inhibitor atri tuvusertib improv target prostat cancer pca immunotherapi tuvusertib pretreat sensit human pca cell du145 22rv1 pbmcderiv natur killer nkmediat lysi flow cytometr analysi identifi upregul death receptor tumornecrosi factorrel apoptosisinduc ligand receptor 2 trailr2 nkg2d ligand ulbp1 program deathligand 1 pdl1 potenti immunomodulatori effect tuvusertib enhanc avelumabmedi antibodydepend cellmedi cytotox lysi pdl1 target highaffin nk pdl1 thank cell observ tuvusertibtr du145 tuvusertib sensit cell lysi recombin human trail trail signal blockad reduc nkmediat lysi tuvusertibexpos cell rna analysi reveal elev p21 reduc bclxl transcript level tuvusertibtr du145 suggest accumul dna damag suppress antiapoptot signal respect pretreat nk cell interleukin15 il15 receptor superagonist n803 nogapendekin alfa inbakicept enhac lysi tuvusertibexpos cell vivo du145 pca xenograft model tuvusertib n803 combin therapi demonstr mark signific antitumor efficaci rel either monotherapi elicit superior tumor growth control prolong surviv find support investig use atri immun checkpoint blockad andor immunestimul agent prostat cancer
cancer,"Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis. Recent advances in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell immunotherapy have offered renewed hope. The pivotal factors determining the effectiveness of CAR-T cells in the clinic is the selection of a reliable target and a specific ectodomain of CAR molecule. EpCAM is widely expressed in epithelial tumors, including pancreatic cancer, and is used as a tumor target in clinical trials of CAR-T cell therapy for gastric and colorectal cancers. However, the feasibility of using EpCAM CAR-T cells in pancreatic cancer still needs to be verified. In this work, we reported novel EpCAM CAR-T cells with a fully human single-chain variable fragment and evaluated their cytotoxic effects in a panel of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines, three-dimensional tumor spheroid models and patient-derived organoids, and two xenograft mouse models. We demonstrated that EpCAM CAR-T cells exhibited potent and specific anti-tumor activity against EpCAM positive pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo, without adverse effects by systematic delivery in xenograft mouse models. Our preclinical results provided evidence of the efficacy and feasibility of EpCAM CAR-T cells for the immunotherapy of pancreatic cancer.",pancreat cancer aggress malign poor prognosi recent advanc chimer antigen receptor cart cell immunotherapi offer renew hope pivot factor determin effect cart cell clinic select reliabl target specif ectodomain car molecul epcam wide express epitheli tumor includ pancreat cancer use tumor target clinic trial cart cell therapi gastric colorect cancer howev feasibl use epcam cart cell pancreat cancer still need verifi work report novel epcam cart cell fulli human singlechain variabl fragment evalu cytotox effect panel pancreat adenocarcinoma cell line threedimension tumor spheroid model patientderiv organoid two xenograft mous model demonstr epcam cart cell exhibit potent specif antitumor activ epcam posit pancreat cancer vitro vivo without advers effect systemat deliveri xenograft mous model preclin result provid evid efficaci feasibl epcam cart cell immunotherapi pancreat cancer
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) represents a technically challenging procedure for locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The safety and efficacy profiles of LG following NAC remain incompletely defined. This study aimed to compare short- and long-term outcomes between LG and open gastrectomy (OG) in NAC-treated LAGC patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed consecutive LAGC patients undergoing LG or OG following NAC at our institution (Jan 2010-Dec 2019). Data from the prospectively maintained gastric surgery database were evaluated for demographic characteristics, operative parameters, perioperative morbidity, and oncological outcomes. RESULTS: Among 85 patients (46 LG, 39 OG), LG showed reduced blood loss, shorter hospitalization, faster bowel recovery, and earlier oral intake versus OG. Operative time was similar (LG 224 +/- 64 min vs. OG 183 +/- 52 min, P = 0.212). Complication rates were 19.6% (LG) vs. 25.6% (OG) (P = 0.683). At median 52-month follow-up, recurrence rates were 32.6% vs. 41.0% (P = 0.309). Five-year overall survival (51.8% vs. 56.7%, P = 0.492) and disease-free survival (45.3% vs. 52.4%, P = 0.443) showed no significant differences. The analysis involving multiple variables validated that the type of surgical method was not a standalone prognostic indicator for overall survival (P = 0.116) or disease-free survival (P = 0.108). CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic gastrectomy provides non-inferior technical safety and oncologic outcomes compared to open gastrectomy for LAGC after NAC. Given its benefits of being minimally invasive, such as attenuated surgical trauma and faster postoperative recovery, LG should be considered a standard therapeutic option for appropriately selected patients.",background laparoscop gastrectomi lg repres technic challeng procedur local advanc gastric cancer lagc neoadjuv chemotherapi nac safeti efficaci profil lg follow nac remain incomplet defin studi aim compar short longterm outcom lg open gastrectomi og nactreat lagc patient method retrospect analyz consecut lagc patient undergo lg og follow nac institut jan 2010dec 2019 data prospect maintain gastric surgeri databas evalu demograph characterist oper paramet periop morbid oncolog outcom result among 85 patient 46 lg 39 og lg show reduc blood loss shorter hospit faster bowel recoveri earlier oral intak versu og oper time similar lg 224 64 min vs og 183 52 min p 0212 complic rate 196 lg vs 256 og p 0683 median 52month followup recurr rate 326 vs 410 p 0309 fiveyear overal surviv 518 vs 567 p 0492 diseasefre surviv 453 vs 524 p 0443 show signific differ analysi involv multipl variabl valid type surgic method standalon prognost indic overal surviv p 0116 diseasefre surviv p 0108 conclus laparoscop gastrectomi provid noninferior technic safeti oncolog outcom compar open gastrectomi lagc nac given benefit minim invas attenu surgic trauma faster postop recoveri lg consid standard therapeut option appropri select patient
cancer,"The abnormal function of histone lysine demethylase 6B (KDM6B) is closely associated with the development and progression of various human diseases, including cancer, inflammatory disorders, and psychiatric conditions, supporting KDM6B as a significant therapeutic target. However, the development of potent and selective KDM6B inhibitors remains a critical unmet need. Based on the hit compound (A01) discovered by enzyme-level screening, a series of derivatives with quinazoline scaffold were designed, synthesized and identified as KDM6B inhibitors. Among these, compound 13k exhibited optimal potency (IC(50) = 1.8 muM) with superior selectivity over other JMJD subfamily members. Furthermore, 13k upregulates histone methylation levels in THP-1 cells, highlighting its functional effect in a cellular context. This study provides a promising scaffold for developing selective KDM6B inhibitors, as well as delivers a tool compound for probing the biological functions of KDM6B.

cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the biological functions of KHDRBS2 and KHDRBS3 in prostate cancer (PCa) progression and their potential roles in regulating androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) expression, a key factor in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). METHODS: We performed a comprehensive analysis of publicly available datasets to examine the expression patterns of KHDRBS family members in PCa, including CRPC and neuroendocrine subtypes. In vitro experiments were conducted using AR-positive 22RV1 and AR-negative PC3 cell lines to assess the expression and regulatory interactions of KHDRBS2 and KHDRBS3. Functional assays evaluated their effects on cell proliferation and tumor growth in vivo. Additionally, KHDRBS2 protein levels were manipulated in 22RV1 cells to assess their impact on AR-V7 and full-length AR expression. RESULTS: Our dataset analysis revealed distinct expression patterns of KHDRBS2 and KHDRBS3, with higher alteration frequencies in CRPC and neuroendocrine PCa. In vitro, KHDRBS2 and KHDRBS3 exhibited mutually exclusive expression, with KHDRBS2 predominantly found in AR-positive 22RV1 cells and KHDRBS3 in AR-negative PC3 cells. Reciprocal regulation between the two proteins was observed in both cell lines. Functional studies showed that both KHDRBS2 and KHDRBS3 promoted cell proliferation and tumor growth. Notably, silencing KHDRBS2 in 22RV1 cells led to a selective reduction in AR-V7 expression, without affecting full-length AR levels. CONCLUSIONS: These findings uncover novel roles for KHDRBS2 and KHDRBS3 in PCa progression, with KHDRBS2 identified as a potential key regulator of AR-V7 expression. Our results provide new insights into AR splice variant regulation and highlight potential therapeutic targets for PCa treatment.",object investig biolog function khdrbs2 khdrbs3 prostat cancer pca progress potenti role regul androgen receptor splice variant 7 arv7 express key factor castrationresist prostat cancer crpc method perform comprehens analysi publicli avail dataset examin express pattern khdrb famili member pca includ crpc neuroendocrin subtyp vitro experi conduct use arposit 22rv1 arneg pc3 cell line assess express regulatori interact khdrbs2 khdrbs3 function assay evalu effect cell prolifer tumor growth vivo addit khdrbs2 protein level manipul 22rv1 cell assess impact arv7 fulllength ar express result dataset analysi reveal distinct express pattern khdrbs2 khdrbs3 higher alter frequenc crpc neuroendocrin pca vitro khdrbs2 khdrbs3 exhibit mutual exclus express khdrbs2 predominantli found arposit 22rv1 cell khdrbs3 arneg pc3 cell reciproc regul two protein observ cell line function studi show khdrbs2 khdrbs3 promot cell prolifer tumor growth notabl silenc khdrbs2 22rv1 cell led select reduct arv7 express without affect fulllength ar level conclus find uncov novel role khdrbs2 khdrbs3 pca progress khdrbs2 identifi potenti key regul arv7 express result provid new insight ar splice variant regul highlight potenti therapeut target pca treatment
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) improves oncological outcomes of high-risk patients with breast cancer. However, its impact on breast reconstruction remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of PMRT in breast reconstruction from the patient's perspective. METHODS: This multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted in 10 Japanese institutions. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were collected using a comprehensive questionnaire incorporating surgical complications and the Japanese version 2.0 of the BREAST-Q ""Adverse effect of radiation"" module from 830 patients with breast cancer who had undergone reconstruction (214 with PMRT, 616 without). Complication rates were compared between the PMRT and non-PMRT groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of complications. RESULTS: The PMRT group showed a significantly higher overall complication rate (76.2% vs. 45.3%, P < 0.001), including dermatitis (48.1% vs. 9.9%, P < 0.001), cutaneous necrosis (9.8% vs. 2.9%, P < 0.001), capsular contracture (16.4% vs. 4.9%, P = 0.020), breast asymmetry (24.3% vs. 17.0%, P = 0.020), and upper limb lymphedema (7.5% vs. 1.1%, P < 0.001) versus the non-PMRT group. In the multivariate analysis, PMRT was identified as an independent risk factor only for cutaneous necrosis (P < 0.001). Adverse effects of radiation were observed in the PMRT group, including dryness (52.3%), pigmentation (46.4%), irritation (39.8%), soreness (38.7%), telangiectasias (36.4%), and skin thickness changes (33.2%). CONCLUSION: This is the first large-scale investigation in Japan to evaluate PMRT-related complications in patients who underwent breast reconstruction using PROs. Although PMRT increases complication rates, its direct impact is limited. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating patient-centered data into shared decision-making regarding reconstruction strategies.",background postmastectomi radiat therapi pmrt improv oncolog outcom highrisk patient breast cancer howev impact breast reconstruct remain unclear studi aim evalu safeti pmrt breast reconstruct patient perspect method multicent crosssect studi conduct 10 japanes institut patientreport outcom pro collect use comprehens questionnair incorpor surgic complic japanes version 20 breastq advers effect radiat modul 830 patient breast cancer undergon reconstruct 214 pmrt 616 without complic rate compar pmrt nonpmrt group logist regress analysi use identifi independ predictor complic result pmrt group show significantli higher overal complic rate 762 vs 453 p 0001 includ dermat 481 vs 99 p 0001 cutan necrosi 98 vs 29 p 0001 capsular contractur 164 vs 49 p 0020 breast asymmetri 243 vs 170 p 0020 upper limb lymphedema 75 vs 11 p 0001 versu nonpmrt group multivari analysi pmrt identifi independ risk factor cutan necrosi p 0001 advers effect radiat observ pmrt group includ dryness 523 pigment 464 irrit 398 sore 387 telangiectasia 364 skin thick chang 332 conclus first largescal investig japan evalu pmrtrelat complic patient underw breast reconstruct use pro although pmrt increas complic rate direct impact limit find highlight import incorpor patientcent data share decisionmak regard reconstruct strategi
cancer,"While breast cancer treatment outcomes have improved significantly through multidisciplinary approaches including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, the incidence of non-neoplastic pulmonary complications has also increased. Accurate interpretation of chest imaging is essential for managing these adverse events. This review outlines the major radiological findings of pulmonary injury during breast cancer treatment, focusing on two primary categories: drug-associated interstitial lung disease (DILD) and radiotherapy-associated lung injury (RLI). Regarding DILD, its clinical features, risk factors, differential diagnosis, and diverse patterns on high-resolution CT (HRCT) are described. The lung injury characteristics associated with specific drugs used in breast cancer treatment are also examined, placing particular emphasis on clinically important agents like trastuzumab deruxtecan. Regarding RLI, the pathophysiology (including acute radiation pneumonitis and chronic radiation fibrosis), relevant risk factors, and typical CT findings localized to the radiation field are discussed. Atypical manifestations are also addressed, such as radiation-induced organizing pneumonia (OP) outside the radiation field and the unique phenomenon of radiation recall pneumonitis. These complications can present with symptoms and imaging findings that mimic one another as well as other conditions, such as infections and lymphangitic carcinomatosis. This review aims to facilitate the timely and accurate differential diagnosis of pulmonary complications in breast cancer patients, thereby guiding appropriate therapeutic strategies and enhancing patient safety.",breast cancer treatment outcom improv significantli multidisciplinari approach includ surgeri chemotherapi radiat therapi incid nonneoplast pulmonari complic also increas accur interpret chest imag essenti manag advers event review outlin major radiolog find pulmonari injuri breast cancer treatment focus two primari categori drugassoci interstiti lung diseas dild radiotherapyassoci lung injuri rli regard dild clinic featur risk factor differenti diagnosi divers pattern highresolut ct hrct describ lung injuri characterist associ specif drug use breast cancer treatment also examin place particular emphasi clinic import agent like trastuzumab deruxtecan regard rli pathophysiolog includ acut radiat pneumon chronic radiat fibrosi relev risk factor typic ct find local radiat field discuss atyp manifest also address radiationinduc organ pneumonia op outsid radiat field uniqu phenomenon radiat recal pneumon complic present symptom imag find mimic one anoth well condit infect lymphangit carcinomatosi review aim facilit time accur differenti diagnosi pulmonari complic breast cancer patient therebi guid appropri therapeut strategi enhanc patient safeti

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally. One of the current systemic therapies against estrogen receptor-positive BC is hormonal therapy with tamoxifen (TAM), a selective estrogen receptor modulator. Recent studies showed that TAM resistance may occur often due to enhanced drug efflux mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and ultimately can affect treatment efficacy. Epibrassinolide (EBR) is an apoptotic agent by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR). Continuous activation of UPR was suggested as a strategy to combat drug resistance, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we showed the anti-cancer potential of EBR on TAM-resistant cells, as well as parental cells by MTT cell viability, clonogenic and hanging drop assays, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay, and fluorescence stainings using 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and 3,3'-Dihexyloxacarbocyanine Iodide (DiOC6) for DNA condensation and mitochondrial membrane potential loss, respectively. The apoptotic potential of combined treatment of EBR and TAM was evaluated by western blotting and flow cytometry. The contribution of EBR-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress to the attenuation of TAM resistance was substantiated by its reversal upon pharmacological inhibition with TUDCA (Tauroursodeoxycholic acid). CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings demonstrated that EBR exerts potent anti-cancer effects on both TAM-resistant and parental breast cancer cells. The combined administration of EBR and TAM enhanced apoptotic signaling. Our data also revealed that EBR-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress plays a critical role in sensitizing TAM-resistant cells, since pharmacological inhibition of ER stress with TUDCA markedly attenuated these effects. Taken together, these results highlight EBR as a promising adjuvant strategy to overcome TAM resistance by targeting ER stress-mediated apoptotic pathways.",background breast cancer bc frequent diagnos cancer among women lead caus cancerrel mortal global one current system therapi estrogen receptorposit bc hormon therapi tamoxifen tam select estrogen receptor modul recent studi show tam resist may occur often due enhanc drug efflux mediat atpbind cassett abc transport ultim affect treatment efficaci epibrassinolid ebr apoptot agent induc endoplasm reticulum er stress unfold protein respons upr continu activ upr suggest strategi combat drug resist underscor potenti therapeut target method result studi show anticanc potenti ebr tamresist cell well parent cell mtt cell viabil clonogen hang drop assay lactat dehydrogenas ldh cytotox assay fluoresc stain use 46diamidino2phenylindol dapi 33dihexyloxacarbocyanin iodid dioc6 dna condens mitochondri membran potenti loss respect apoptot potenti combin treatment ebr tam evalu western blot flow cytometri contribut ebrinduc endoplasm reticulum stress attenu tam resist substanti revers upon pharmacolog inhibit tudca tauroursodeoxychol acid conclus collect find demonstr ebr exert potent anticanc effect tamresist parent breast cancer cell combin administr ebr tam enhanc apoptot signal data also reveal ebrinduc endoplasm reticulum stress play critic role sensit tamresist cell sinc pharmacolog inhibit er stress tudca markedli attenu effect taken togeth result highlight ebr promis adjuv strategi overcom tam resist target er stressmedi apoptot pathway
cancer,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate breast cancer therapy-related myocardial cardiotoxicity by analyzing right ventricular (RV), left atrial (LA), and right atrial (RA) function using cardiovascular magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective single-center study involved 38 female breast cancer patients with a mean age of 50 +/- 11 years, who received systemic anthracycline chemotherapy. CMR was performed in all patients before initiating therapy (at baseline (BL)) and after a 12-month follow-up (FU). FT was utilized to evaluate the RV global longitudinal (GLS), radial (GRS), and circumferential strain (GCS), as well as the biatrial reservoir, booster, and conduit strain. Paired t-tests were used to assess the differences in strain values from BL to FU. RESULTS: The mean RV GLS of all patients was significantly attenuated at FU compared to BL (-25.2 +/- 3.9% at BL vs -20.6 +/- 4.4% at FU, p < 0.001), whereas RV GRS and GCS showed no significant change. LA reservoir strain was significantly reduced at FU (24.1 +/- 3.2 at BL vs 22.7 +/- 3.3% at FU, p = 0.005), while LA booster and conduit strain showed non-significant change. Similarly, RA reservoir strain decreased significantly from BL to FU (24.9 +/- 3.3% at BL vs 23.2 +/- 2.9% at FU, p = 0.019), whereas RA booster and conduit strain did not significantly change from BL to FU. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) is not confined to the LV but affects the RV and the atria as well. Changes in RV GLS and LA/RA reservoir strain could serve as additional markers of subclinical cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients. KEY POINTS: Question The role of RV and biatrial strain in detecting CTRCD is unclear. Findings Biatrial reservoir strain and RV GLS were significantly attenuated after breast cancer therapy. Clinical relevance RV GLS and biatrial reservoir strain might serve as early markers of subclinical cardiotoxicity after breast cancer therapy and should thus be routinely determined in patients with suspected CTRCD.",object investig breast cancer therapyrel myocardi cardiotox analyz right ventricular rv left atrial la right atrial ra function use cardiovascular magnet reson featur track cmrft materi method prospect singlecent studi involv 38 femal breast cancer patient mean age 50 11 year receiv system anthracyclin chemotherapi cmr perform patient initi therapi baselin bl 12month followup fu ft util evalu rv global longitudin gl radial gr circumferenti strain gc well biatrial reservoir booster conduit strain pair ttest use assess differ strain valu bl fu result mean rv gl patient significantli attenu fu compar bl 252 39 bl vs 206 44 fu p 0001 wherea rv gr gc show signific chang la reservoir strain significantli reduc fu 241 32 bl vs 227 33 fu p 0005 la booster conduit strain show nonsignific chang similarli ra reservoir strain decreas significantli bl fu 249 33 bl vs 232 29 fu p 0019 wherea ra booster conduit strain significantli chang bl fu conclus cancer therapyrel cardiac dysfunct ctrcd confin lv affect rv atria well chang rv gl lara reservoir strain could serv addit marker subclin cardiotox breast cancer patient key point question role rv biatrial strain detect ctrcd unclear find biatrial reservoir strain rv gl significantli attenu breast cancer therapi clinic relev rv gl biatrial reservoir strain might serv earli marker subclin cardiotox breast cancer therapi thu routin determin patient suspect ctrcd
cancer,"OBJECTIVES: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, making accurate diagnostic imaging essential for evaluating focal breast complaints. Standard breast imaging includes mammography (MG), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), and targeted ultrasound (US). Little information is known about the added value of MG/DBT compared to targeted US alone in women with focal breast complaints. This review provides a systematic overview of the (relative) sensitivity of MG/DBT, next to the use of targeted US in women with focal breast complaints, while emphasizing the variations of the reported guidelines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive PubMed search was conducted to identify articles published between January 2002 and February 2024 that assessed the diagnostic performance of MG/DBT and targeted US in women presenting with focal breast complaints. RESULTS: Of the 985 identified studies, 10 met the inclusion criteria after full-text evaluation. Palpable lumps and focal pain are the more frequent symptoms. Most studies show a high sensitivity (range 84.6-100%, the largest study reported 98.3%) of targeted US alone in relatively young women (30-39 years). Mammograms show added value, particularly when it comes to determining the extent of breast cancer and when confirming a benign abnormality. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted US is a reliable initial imaging modality, particularly in younger women (</= 40). When the US suggests a benign finding in low/average-risk women, the added value of MG is minimal. Routine use should be weighed against the risk of overdiagnosis, unnecessary biopsies, and radiation exposure. KEY POINTS: Question The best imaging strategy for women aged 30-40 with focal breast complaints is uncertain, and whether US alone suffices remains unresolved. Findings Initial targeted US shows high accuracy in this diagnostic setting, with MG/DBT adding value mainly in determination of tumor extent and from a screening perspective. Clinical relevance Using US as the primary imaging for women < 40 with focal breast symptoms may reduce MG, radiation, and discomfort, while maintaining cancer detection; however, any discordance between clinical and imaging findings should always prompt further evaluation.",object breast cancer common cancer among women make accur diagnost imag essenti evalu focal breast complaint standard breast imag includ mammographi mg digit breast tomosynthesi dbt target ultrasound us littl inform known ad valu mgdbt compar target us alon women focal breast complaint review provid systemat overview rel sensit mgdbt next use target us women focal breast complaint emphas variat report guidelin materi method comprehens pubm search conduct identifi articl publish januari 2002 februari 2024 assess diagnost perform mgdbt target us women present focal breast complaint result 985 identifi studi 10 met inclus criteria fulltext evalu palpabl lump focal pain frequent symptom studi show high sensit rang 846100 largest studi report 983 target us alon rel young women 3039 year mammogram show ad valu particularli come determin extent breast cancer confirm benign abnorm conclus target us reliabl initi imag modal particularli younger women 40 us suggest benign find lowaveragerisk women ad valu mg minim routin use weigh risk overdiagnosi unnecessari biopsi radiat exposur key point question best imag strategi women age 3040 focal breast complaint uncertain whether us alon suffic remain unresolv find initi target us show high accuraci diagnost set mgdbt ad valu mainli determin tumor extent screen perspect clinic relev use us primari imag women 40 focal breast symptom may reduc mg radiat discomfort maintain cancer detect howev discord clinic imag find alway prompt evalu
cancer,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate new multidetector CT (MDCT) criteria as predictors of resection margin status in pancreatic body and tail adenocarcinoma (PBTA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled PBTA patients who underwent pancreatectomy. Resection margin status was classified as R0 and R1/R2. Clinical and radiological features were analyzed, including tumor resectability status based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria, tumor size, tumor-vascular contact, rim enhancement, peripancreatic fat stranding, adjacent organ invasion, and the minimum distance between the tumor and the anterior (TAS) and posterior (TPS) surfaces of the pancreas. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of resection margin status, with model performance assessed using ROC curves and DeLong tests. RESULTS: A total of 318 PBTA patients were randomly assigned to a training cohort (n = 222) and a validation cohort (n = 96) in a 7:3 ratio. Among them, 115 (51.8%) and 46 (47.9%) patients underwent R1/R2 resection, respectively. Independent predictors of R1/R2 resection included tumor resectability status (odds ratio (OR), 2.79), tumor size (OR, 3.17), rim enhancement (OR, 3.28), peripancreatic fat stranding (OR, 2.38), and TAS (OR, 8.91) (all p < 0.05). Model B (including all five independent predictors) outperformed Model A (including four independent predictors without TAS) in predicting the resection margin status in both cohorts (training: AUC 0.840 vs 0.757, p = 0.001; validation: 0.810 vs 0.711, p = 0.029). CONCLUSION: In addition to tumor resectability status, tumor size, rim enhancement, and peripancreatic fat stranding, TAS emerges as a potential predictor of resection margin status in PBTA patients. KEY POINTS: Question Resection margin status is associated with overall survival in pancreatic body and tail adenocarcinoma (PBTA), and predicting resection margin status is vital for risk stratification. Findings Clinical and CT-based radiological features, particularly the minimum tumor-to-anterior-surface (TAS) distance, can assist in preoperatively predicting the resection margin status in PBTA patients. Clinical relevance The nomogram integrating clinical and radiological features provides a reliable tool for preoperative prediction of resection margin status, supporting individualized and optimized treatment planning for PBTA patients.",object evalu new multidetector ct mdct criteria predictor resect margin statu pancreat bodi tail adenocarcinoma pbta materi method retrospect studi enrol pbta patient underw pancreatectomi resect margin statu classifi r0 r1r2 clinic radiolog featur analyz includ tumor resect statu base nation comprehens cancer network nccn criteria tumor size tumorvascular contact rim enhanc peripancreat fat strand adjac organ invas minimum distanc tumor anterior ta posterior tp surfac pancrea logist regress analys perform identifi independ predictor resect margin statu model perform assess use roc curv delong test result total 318 pbta patient randomli assign train cohort n 222 valid cohort n 96 73 ratio among 115 518 46 479 patient underw r1r2 resect respect independ predictor r1r2 resect includ tumor resect statu odd ratio 279 tumor size 317 rim enhanc 328 peripancreat fat strand 238 ta 891 p 005 model b includ five independ predictor outperform model includ four independ predictor without ta predict resect margin statu cohort train auc 0840 vs 0757 p 0001 valid 0810 vs 0711 p 0029 conclus addit tumor resect statu tumor size rim enhanc peripancreat fat strand ta emerg potenti predictor resect margin statu pbta patient key point question resect margin statu associ overal surviv pancreat bodi tail adenocarcinoma pbta predict resect margin statu vital risk stratif find clinic ctbase radiolog featur particularli minimum tumortoanteriorsurfac ta distanc assist preoper predict resect margin statu pbta patient clinic relev nomogram integr clinic radiolog featur provid reliabl tool preoper predict resect margin statu support individu optim treatment plan pbta patient
cancer,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Breast cancer (BRCA) remains one of the most prevalent malignancies and a major threat to women's health worldwide. The biological role and mechanistic basis of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) RERE-AS1 in BRCA remain unclear. METHODS: Clinical and RNA sequencing data from BRCA patients were analyzed to determine RERE-AS1 expression levels. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to visualize its distribution in tumor tissues. Functional assays were conducted in MCF-7 and T47D cells to assess the effects of RERE-AS1 on cellular proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), Transwell assays, and flow cytometry. Cell cycle progression was also evaluated. A co-culture system of BRCA cells and immune cells was established to examine immune cell migration, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and immune cytotoxicity. Cytokine secretion was quantified via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore, a xenograft mouse model was utilized to confirm the impact of RERE-AS1 on tumor growth and its response to anti-PD-1 therapy. RESULTS: RERE-AS1 expression was markedly decreased in BRCA tissues and correlated with overall survival (OS), tumor stage, and immune infiltration levels. Functional experiments demonstrated that RERE-AS1 overexpression inhibited BRCA cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Additionally, RERE-AS1 strengthened the interaction between BRCA and immune cells, reduced immune escape, and enhanced tumor sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. CONCLUSION: RERE-AS1 acts as a promising prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in BRCA. Its expression is closely associated with disease progression and patient outcomes and plays a regulatory role in tumor cell behavior and immune microenvironment modulation.

cancer,"Bladder cancer ranks among the most common malignancies of the urinary system. Despite continuous advances in treatment technologies, the risk of tumor progression and metastasis remains high due to its extreme heterogeneity, resulting in poor patient prognosis. Patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer face the greatest challenges. Immediate clinical treatment is radical cystectomy after the administration of neoadjuvant therapy. The effect of different conventional chemotherapeutic drugs is heavily impaired by tumor resistance. In turn, the research of effective therapeutic approaches to prevent resistance of malignant tumors has turned out to be the most important clinical concern in the management of bladder cancer. Ferroptosis is another type of programmed cell death that is morphologically and mechanistically different than apoptosis and necrosis. To maintain high rates of proliferation, bladder cancer cells are hypernormal to iron-dependent oxidative stress. So using the ferroptosis inducers to destabilize their vulnerable antioxidant defenses provides a very specific targeting approach to the weaknesses of this natural metabolic homeostasis. Inductors of ferroptosis (erastin, artemisinin, conjugated polymer nanoparticle, quinazoline-aromatic urea analogue derivatives, etc.) show great potential in improving the efficacy of traditional anticancer drugs used to fight against bladder cancer. Preclinical studies combining standard therapies with ferroptosis-related treatments have yielded promising results. However, clinical trials targeting ferroptosis in bladder cancer remain scarce, posing challenges for translating these findings into clinical practice. In this review, we aim to highlight the latest advances in ferroptosis induction as a therapeutic strategy for bladder cancer. It provides a reference for subsequent research and additional insights into the development and validation of corresponding drugs for bladder cancer treatment.",bladder cancer rank among common malign urinari system despit continu advanc treatment technolog risk tumor progress metastasi remain high due extrem heterogen result poor patient prognosi patient muscleinvas bladder cancer face greatest challeng immedi clinic treatment radic cystectomi administr neoadjuv therapi effect differ convent chemotherapeut drug heavili impair tumor resist turn research effect therapeut approach prevent resist malign tumor turn import clinic concern manag bladder cancer ferroptosi anoth type program cell death morpholog mechanist differ apoptosi necrosi maintain high rate prolifer bladder cancer cell hypernorm irondepend oxid stress use ferroptosi induc destabil vulner antioxid defens provid specif target approach weak natur metabol homeostasi inductor ferroptosi erastin artemisinin conjug polym nanoparticl quinazolinearomat urea analogu deriv etc show great potenti improv efficaci tradit anticanc drug use fight bladder cancer preclin studi combin standard therapi ferroptosisrel treatment yield promis result howev clinic trial target ferroptosi bladder cancer remain scarc pose challeng translat find clinic practic review aim highlight latest advanc ferroptosi induct therapeut strategi bladder cancer provid refer subsequ research addit insight develop valid correspond drug bladder cancer treatment
cancer,"PURPOSE: Breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent cancer among women worldwide. Previous studies have associated it with lifestyle factors, including diet, although findings on diet remain limited or inconsistent. In Morocco, research on the role of dietary factors in BC risk is particularly scarce. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the association between dietary patterns and BC risk among Moroccan women. METHODS: A total of 2.800 women from Morocco participated in this case control study. Data were collected using a validated FFQ adapted to the Moroccan context, and Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to identify dietary patterns. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to assess BC risk across quartiles of adherence to each identified dietary pattern. RESULTS: PCA revealed four distinct dietary patterns. After adjusting for potential confounders, the ""Sugary and Refined Carbohydrate Diet"" was positively associated with higher odds of BC (OR = 7.71; 95% CI (5.79-10.26); p < 0.001). In contrast, the ""Plant-Based and Mediterranean Diet"" was inversely associated with BC risk (OR = 0.26; 95% CI 0.20-0.34; p < 0.001). For the dairy-rich diet, higher adherence showed lower BC odds in mid-quartiles, but the highest quartile was associated with higher odds after adjustment (OR = 1.79; 95% CI 1.41-2.29; p < 0.001). No significant associations were found for the Animal protein rich diet in relation to BC risk. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential risk of diets high in refined carbohydrates and the protective benefits of plant-based and Mediterranean diets in preventing BC.",purpos breast cancer bc preval cancer among women worldwid previou studi associ lifestyl factor includ diet although find diet remain limit inconsist morocco research role dietari factor bc risk particularli scarc studi therefor aim evalu associ dietari pattern bc risk among moroccan women method total 2800 women morocco particip case control studi data collect use valid ffq adapt moroccan context princip compon analysi pca appli identifi dietari pattern multivariateadjust odd ratio 95 confid interv calcul assess bc risk across quartil adher identifi dietari pattern result pca reveal four distinct dietari pattern adjust potenti confound sugari refin carbohydr diet posit associ higher odd bc 771 95 ci 5791026 p 0001 contrast plantbas mediterranean diet invers associ bc risk 026 95 ci 020034 p 0001 dairyrich diet higher adher show lower bc odd midquartil highest quartil associ higher odd adjust 179 95 ci 141229 p 0001 signific associ found anim protein rich diet relat bc risk conclus studi highlight potenti risk diet high refin carbohydr protect benefit plantbas mediterranean diet prevent bc
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia and altered body composition have been associated with poor outcomes in cancer patients. We investigated whether skeletal muscle index (SMI), visceral fat area (VFA), and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) measured on CT scans predict survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. METHODS: This retrospective pilot study analyzed 46 NSCLC patients who had CT scans within 60 days of initiating checkpoint inhibitor therapy (93.5% pembrolizumab, 6.5% nivolumab) at a single tertiary care center. Body composition metrics were measured at the L3 vertebral level using TeraRecon software by a trained reader. Sarcopenia was defined using validated cutoffs (males < 45.4 cm(2)/m(2), females < 34.4 cm(2)/m(2)). Cox proportional hazards models evaluated associations between body composition and survival, with analyses stratified by sex. RESULTS: The cohort included 25 males (54.3%) and 21 females (45.7%), with median time from CT scan to checkpoint inhibitor initiation of 14 days (IQR: -47 to 18). One-year survival was 72.0% for males and 59.3% for females; two-year survival was 33.7% and 27.3%, respectively. Those who met the clinical criteria for sarcopenia did not statistically differ in survival compared to those who did not meet the clinical cut off (HR 1.21 (95% CI 0.63, 2.43). This finding remained consistent when males and females were examined separately and when the model was adjusted for timing to checkpoint inhibitor. CONCLUSION: In this small pilot study, pre-treatment body composition metrics did not significantly predict survival in NSCLC patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors. However, the study was likely underpowered with wide confidence intervals, limiting definitive conclusions. These findings provide a methodological framework for larger multicenter studies to validate the prognostic utility of CT-derived body composition in this population.",background sarcopenia alter bodi composit associ poor outcom cancer patient investig whether skelet muscl index smi viscer fat area vfa subcutan fat area sfa measur ct scan predict surviv nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc patient receiv immun checkpoint inhibitor therapi method retrospect pilot studi analyz 46 nsclc patient ct scan within 60 day initi checkpoint inhibitor therapi 935 pembrolizumab 65 nivolumab singl tertiari care center bodi composit metric measur l3 vertebr level use terarecon softwar train reader sarcopenia defin use valid cutoff male 454 cm2m2 femal 344 cm2m2 cox proport hazard model evalu associ bodi composit surviv analys stratifi sex result cohort includ 25 male 543 21 femal 457 median time ct scan checkpoint inhibitor initi 14 day iqr 47 18 oneyear surviv 720 male 593 femal twoyear surviv 337 273 respect met clinic criteria sarcopenia statist differ surviv compar meet clinic cut hr 121 95 ci 063 243 find remain consist male femal examin separ model adjust time checkpoint inhibitor conclus small pilot studi pretreat bodi composit metric significantli predict surviv nsclc patient receiv checkpoint inhibitor howev studi like underpow wide confid interv limit definit conclus find provid methodolog framework larger multicent studi valid prognost util ctderiv bodi composit popul
cancer,"PURPOSE: Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is associated with high recurrence and poor prognosis. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) offers a locoregional treatment strategy. However, the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin administered via HIPEC compared to intravenous (IV) infusion remain insufficiently characterized. This study aimed to compare local abdominal tissue concentrations and systemic exposure of cisplatin following HIPEC and IV administration in a healthy porcine model using microdialysis. METHODS: Sixteen healthy Danish Landrace pigs were divided into HIPEC (n = 8) and IV (n = 8) groups. The HIPEC group underwent CRS followed by 90-minute cisplatin-based HIPEC. The IV group received an equivalent cisplatin dose intravenously (100 mg/m(2)). Microdialysis catheters were placed in the liver, rectum, stomach (superficial and profound layers) and peritoneum. Free cisplatin concentrations were quantified using UPLC-MS/MS. RESULTS: Within the HIPEC group, cisplatin C(max) and AUC(0 - last) were significantly higher in the peritoneum compared to other abdominal tissues and plasma. The peritoneal-to-plasma AUC(0 - last) ratio was 8.7 for HIPEC vs. 1.8 for IV infusion (ratio: 4.92, 95% CI: 3.12-7.78, p < 0.001). Compared to IV infusion, HIPEC achieved significantly higher peritoneal C(max), while peritoneal AUC(0 - last) was comparable. In contrast, IV infusion resulted in significantly higher plasma and non-peritoneal tissue exposure. Plasma AUC(0 - last) was 4.7-fold higher following IV administration compared to HIPEC (95%-CI: 3.0-7.3, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: HIPEC concentrates cisplatin within the peritoneum while minimizing systemic distribution, whereas IV administration leads to a broad systemic and less targeted exposure. These findings support the pharmacologic rationale for HIPEC in maximizing local cytotoxicity and minimizing systemic toxicity in EOC treatment.",purpos epitheli ovarian cancer eoc associ high recurr poor prognosi cytoreduct surgeri cr hypertherm intraperiton chemotherapi hipec offer locoregion treatment strategi howev pharmacokinet cisplatin administ via hipec compar intraven iv infus remain insuffici character studi aim compar local abdomin tissu concentr system exposur cisplatin follow hipec iv administr healthi porcin model use microdialysi method sixteen healthi danish landrac pig divid hipec n 8 iv n 8 group hipec group underw cr follow 90minut cisplatinbas hipec iv group receiv equival cisplatin dose intraven 100 mgm2 microdialysi cathet place liver rectum stomach superfici profound layer peritoneum free cisplatin concentr quantifi use uplcmsm result within hipec group cisplatin cmax auc0 last significantli higher peritoneum compar abdomin tissu plasma peritonealtoplasma auc0 last ratio 87 hipec vs 18 iv infus ratio 492 95 ci 312778 p 0001 compar iv infus hipec achiev significantli higher periton cmax periton auc0 last compar contrast iv infus result significantli higher plasma nonperiton tissu exposur plasma auc0 last 47fold higher follow iv administr compar hipec 95ci 3073 p 0001 conclus hipec concentr cisplatin within peritoneum minim system distribut wherea iv administr lead broad system less target exposur find support pharmacolog rational hipec maxim local cytotox minim system toxic eoc treatment
cancer,"PURPOSE: About 30-50% of lung cancer patients suffer from insomnia with limited prevention options. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate whether acupuncture for cancer-related symptoms such as pain could reduce the incidence of insomnia symptoms. METHODS: We included newly diagnosed lung cancer patients without prior insomnia symptoms from Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine (2012-2021) and followed up until January 31, 2022. Cases were propensity score-matched by sex, age, ECOG PS score, pathological diagnosis, therapy, and comorbidities. The main outcome was the incidence of insomnia symptoms, identified by psychiatric diagnosis or insomnia symptoms in medical records. RESULTS: Among 1295 lung cancer survivors, 918 patients were matched (459 per group). Over an average follow-up of 218.6 days, insomnia symptoms were observed in 20.9% of the acupuncture group and 42.2% of the non-acupuncture group. Acupuncture was linked to a lower incidence of insomnia symptoms (adjusted HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.23-0.39). Higher frequency and more numerous acupuncture sessions further reduced the risk of insomnia symptoms (adjusted HR 0.15 for frequency of 1 day/session, adjusted HR 0.15 for sessions > 16). The acupuncture group had a significantly lower cumulative incidence of insomnia (log-rank test, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that acupuncture may prevent the incidence of insomnia symptoms in patients with lung cancer. Daily sessions and a cumulative total of 16 or more treatments may enhance the benefit.",purpos 3050 lung cancer patient suffer insomnia limit prevent option conduct retrospect cohort studi investig whether acupunctur cancerrel symptom pain could reduc incid insomnia symptom method includ newli diagnos lung cancer patient without prior insomnia symptom guangdong provinci hospit chines medicin 20122021 follow januari 31 2022 case propens scorematch sex age ecog ps score patholog diagnosi therapi comorbid main outcom incid insomnia symptom identifi psychiatr diagnosi insomnia symptom medic record result among 1295 lung cancer survivor 918 patient match 459 per group averag followup 2186 day insomnia symptom observ 209 acupunctur group 422 nonacupunctur group acupunctur link lower incid insomnia symptom adjust hr 031 95 ci 023039 higher frequenc numer acupunctur session reduc risk insomnia symptom adjust hr 015 frequenc 1 daysess adjust hr 015 session 16 acupunctur group significantli lower cumul incid insomnia logrank test p 001 conclus result suggest acupunctur may prevent incid insomnia symptom patient lung cancer daili session cumul total 16 treatment may enhanc benefit
cancer,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility and accuracy of using deep learning to generate simulated contrast-enhanced T1-weighted rectal MRI scans from pre-contrast MRI sequences in rectal cancer patients. METHODS: This study included 514 patients with pathologically confirmed rectal carcinoma who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI at three academic institutions. A two-dimensional generator adversarial network was used to simulate contrast-enhanced MRI scans from pre-contrast T1-weighted images. Quantitative assessments of image similarity, error metrics, and Dice coefficient for tumor overlap were performed. Three radiologists, blinded to the contrast method, evaluated image quality, tumor enhancement, and extramural vascular invasion (EMVI) in 104 paired real and simulated scans. Tumor size correlation was analyzed with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), and modified Bland-Altman plots were used to assess agreement. ROC curves evaluated diagnostic performance of EMVI detection, and quality scores were compared using the McNemar test. RESULTS: Simulated scans demonstrated high similarity to real scans (structural similarity index: 0.82, Dice coefficient: 0.86 +/- 0.14 for tumor overlap). Tumor size measurements correlated strongly (ICC: 0.76-0.88), with minimal differences in length (0.11 mm) and depth (0.10 mm). ROC analysis revealed slightly higher AUC values for real scans (0.702, 0.772, 0.713) compared to simulated scans (0.685, 0.694, 0.661) for three radiologists, respectively. Nearly all synthetic scans (98%) were rated diagnostically suitable. CONCLUSION: Deep learning-generated simulated contrast-enhanced MRI scans demonstrated comparability to real scans in terms of tumor size, enhancement area, and image quality, suggesting their potential as a supportive tool for diagnosis and treatment evaluation.",object assess feasibl accuraci use deep learn gener simul contrastenhanc t1weight rectal mri scan precontrast mri sequenc rectal cancer patient method studi includ 514 patient patholog confirm rectal carcinoma underw contrastenhanc mri three academ institut twodimension gener adversari network use simul contrastenhanc mri scan precontrast t1weight imag quantit assess imag similar error metric dice coeffici tumor overlap perform three radiologist blind contrast method evalu imag qualiti tumor enhanc extramur vascular invas emvi 104 pair real simul scan tumor size correl analyz intraclass correl coeffici icc modifi blandaltman plot use assess agreement roc curv evalu diagnost perform emvi detect qualiti score compar use mcnemar test result simul scan demonstr high similar real scan structur similar index 082 dice coeffici 086 014 tumor overlap tumor size measur correl strongli icc 076088 minim differ length 011 mm depth 010 mm roc analysi reveal slightli higher auc valu real scan 0702 0772 0713 compar simul scan 0685 0694 0661 three radiologist respect nearli synthet scan 98 rate diagnost suitabl conclus deep learninggener simul contrastenhanc mri scan demonstr compar real scan term tumor size enhanc area imag qualiti suggest potenti support tool diagnosi treatment evalu
cancer,"PURPOSE: Radiation proctitis (RP) is a frequent and clinically relevant complication of radiotherapy (RT) in cervical cancer (CC). However, effective tools for individualized RP risk prediction remain limited. This study aimed to develop and validate an MRI-based radiomic risk score for early RP prediction in CC patients. METHODS: This retrospective study included 375 CC patients who underwent radical RT. Patients were randomly assigned to training (80%) and validation (20%) cohorts. Radiomics features were extracted from pre-treatment MRI and screened using Mann-Whitney U test, intraclass correlation coefficient, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Logistic regression analyses identified independent predictors of RP, and a clinical-radiomics nomogram was constructed. Model performance was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC), calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Of 1,906 extracted features, 9 were selected to construct the radiomics risk score. Independent predictors of RP included lymphocyte counts >/= 2.6 x 10(9)/L, platelet-lymphocyte ratio >/= 196, rectal mean dose >/= 47.22 Gy, and radiomics risk score>/=-0.4. The nomogram incorporating these factors achieved AUCs of 0.810 (training) and 0.730 (validation), with good calibration and clinical utility demonstrated by DCA. CONCLUSION: The proposed MRI-based radiomic risk score enables accurate, noninvasive prediction of RP in CC patients and provides a practical tool to optimize individualized RT planning and toxicity management.",purpos radiat proctiti rp frequent clinic relev complic radiotherapi rt cervic cancer cc howev effect tool individu rp risk predict remain limit studi aim develop valid mribas radiom risk score earli rp predict cc patient method retrospect studi includ 375 cc patient underw radic rt patient randomli assign train 80 valid 20 cohort radiom featur extract pretreat mri screen use mannwhitney u test intraclass correl coeffici least absolut shrinkag select oper regress logist regress analys identifi independ predictor rp clinicalradiom nomogram construct model perform assess area curv auc calibr decis curv analysi dca result 1906 extract featur 9 select construct radiom risk score independ predictor rp includ lymphocyt count 26 x 109l plateletlymphocyt ratio 196 rectal mean dose 4722 gy radiom risk score04 nomogram incorpor factor achiev auc 0810 train 0730 valid good calibr clinic util demonstr dca conclus propos mribas radiom risk score enabl accur noninvas predict rp cc patient provid practic tool optim individu rt plan toxic manag
cancer,"PURPOSE: To investigate the predictive value of CT-derived tumor extracellular volume fraction (ECV) for recurrence in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and to develop a comprehensive clinical prediction model. METHODS: This retrospective study included 97 patients with pathologically confirmed NMIBC treated between July 2017 and December 2022. All patients underwent pre-treatment contrast-enhanced CT scans, including unenhanced and delayed phases. Tumor ECV was independently measured by two radiologists. Clinical variables were retrieved from medical records. The primary outcome was tumor recurrence, confirmed by cystoscopy or imaging during follow-up. Univariable analysis identified candidate predictors (P < 0.1), and correlation testing was used to exclude multicollinearity. A logistic regression model was developed using 5-fold stratified cross-validation. Model performance was assessed using the area under the ROC curve (AUC), calibration curves, and recurrence-free survival estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: The recurrence rate was 34.0% over a median follow-up of 38.8 months. ECV values were significantly higher in recurrent cases (35.1 +/- 11.4%) than in non-recurrent cases (30.7 +/- 7.1%, P = 0.024). ECV independently predicted recurrence (OR = 1.072, 95% CI: 1.008-1.140; P = 0.028). Five variables-gender, tumor location, ECV, resection type, and intravesical chemotherapy-were identified as significant predictors. The model achieved an AUC of 0.722 +/- 0.051 with good calibration. Cox proportional hazards regression demonstrated that higher ECV was significantly associated with recurrence-free survival in transurethral resection of bladder tumor patients (HR = 1.031, 95% CI: 1.002-1.061, P = 0.036). CONCLUSION: CT-derived ECV is a promising imaging biomarker for recurrence prediction in NMIBC. The integrated model provides potential risk stratification and supports personalized clinical decision-making.",purpos investig predict valu ctderiv tumor extracellular volum fraction ecv recurr nonmuscleinvas bladder cancer nmibc develop comprehens clinic predict model method retrospect studi includ 97 patient patholog confirm nmibc treat juli 2017 decemb 2022 patient underw pretreat contrastenhanc ct scan includ unenhanc delay phase tumor ecv independ measur two radiologist clinic variabl retriev medic record primari outcom tumor recurr confirm cystoscopi imag followup univari analysi identifi candid predictor p 01 correl test use exclud multicollinear logist regress model develop use 5fold stratifi crossvalid model perform assess use area roc curv auc calibr curv recurrencefre surviv estim kaplanmei analysi result recurr rate 340 median followup 388 month ecv valu significantli higher recurr case 351 114 nonrecurr case 307 71 p 0024 ecv independ predict recurr 1072 95 ci 10081140 p 0028 five variablesgend tumor locat ecv resect type intraves chemotherapywer identifi signific predictor model achiev auc 0722 0051 good calibr cox proport hazard regress demonstr higher ecv significantli associ recurrencefre surviv transurethr resect bladder tumor patient hr 1031 95 ci 10021061 p 0036 conclus ctderiv ecv promis imag biomark recurr predict nmibc integr model provid potenti risk stratif support person clinic decisionmak
cancer,"Liver tumor diagnosis relies heavily on imaging, and the liver imaging reporting and data system (LI-RADS) provides a structured framework for evaluating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and related entities in at-risk populations. Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly expanded across CT, MRI, and ultrasound/CEUS, yet its clinical credibility depends on adherence to modality-appropriate tasks, robust validation, and alignment with LI-RADS semantics. This narrative review synthesizes methodological patterns, diagnostic performance, and readiness for clinical translation of AI systems designed for liver tumor characterization across major imaging modalities. We examine modality-task alignment-including CT-based differential diagnosis of HCC, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, metastases, and benign mimics; LI-RADS feature detection and category assignment on MRI; LR-M disambiguation on MRI and CEUS; and surveillance-era triage on ultrasound. Evidence quality is appraised through external validation, reader studies, robustness analyses, calibration, and uncertainty reporting. A minimal reporting checklist is provided to support methodological transparency and facilitate reproducibility. Across modalities, AI systems show strong potential to enhance liver tumor diagnosis when they mirror radiologist reasoning, explicitly handle temporal enhancement dynamics, and incorporate clinically relevant priors. Translation into practice will require protocol-aware robustness, calibrated confidence estimates, size-stratified performance reporting, and broader multi-center validation. When developed under these principles, LI-RADS-aligned AI may meaningfully improve consistency, interpretability, and scalability in imaging-based liver cancer care.",liver tumor diagnosi reli heavili imag liver imag report data system lirad provid structur framework evalu hepatocellular carcinoma hcc relat entiti atrisk popul artifici intellig ai rapidli expand across ct mri ultrasoundceu yet clinic credibl depend adher modalityappropri task robust valid align lirad semant narr review synthes methodolog pattern diagnost perform readi clinic translat ai system design liver tumor character across major imag modal examin modalitytask alignmentinclud ctbase differenti diagnosi hcc intrahepat cholangiocarcinoma metastas benign mimic lirad featur detect categori assign mri lrm disambigu mri ceu surveillanceera triag ultrasound evid qualiti apprais extern valid reader studi robust analys calibr uncertainti report minim report checklist provid support methodolog transpar facilit reproduc across modal ai system show strong potenti enhanc liver tumor diagnosi mirror radiologist reason explicitli handl tempor enhanc dynam incorpor clinic relev prior translat practic requir protocolawar robust calibr confid estim sizestratifi perform report broader multicent valid develop principl liradsalign ai may meaning improv consist interpret scalabl imagingbas liver cancer care
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including lenvatinib approved for advanced non-medullary thyroid cancer (TC), affect the immune system. As tumor-related inflammation contributes to TC pathogenesis, this study assesses the immunomodulatory effects of lenvatinib, focusing on myeloid cells. METHODS: Peripheral blood was collected from 16 lenvatinib-treated and 15 untreated TC patients (cross-sectional cohort), and from eight patients before and after > 1 month of lenvatinib (longitudinal cohort). Immune profiling included cell subset counts, proteomic analyses, and ex vivo cytokine assays in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocytes. Monocytes from healthy donors were used to evaluate metabolic activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and phagocytosis. Tumor-intrinsic effects of lenvatinib were studied by proteomics and immunophenotyping of the TPC-1 cell line. RESULTS: Lenvatinib increased lymphocytes and reduced neutrophils. In both cohorts, lenvatinib modulated the inflammatory proteome with elevated VEGFA, CCL11, MMP-10, and TRAIL. Monocytes exposed ex vivo to lenvatinib showed reduced production of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. In patients treated with lenvatinib, monocytes displayed increased IL-1Ra and TNF, while PBMCs exhibited enhanced IFN-gamma production. Monocytes from healthy donors displayed reduced glycolysis and increased ROS after lenvatinib exposure. In TPC-1 cells, lenvatinib altered the secretome and upregulated MHC class I, PD-L1, and CD40. CONCLUSIONS: Lenvatinib treatment has broad immunomodulatory effects in patients with TC, including shifts in immune cell populations, changes in the proteome, and reprogramming of cytokine responses. Lenvatinib also impacts monocyte metabolism and tumor cell phenotype. These findings provide insight into the multifaceted immunological activities of lenvatinib and highlight opportunities for treatment strategies.

cancer,"Th7R is a novel Th1-like CD4(+) T cell lineage characterized by TCF7 and IL-7 receptor expression, exhibiting distinct transcriptional and epigenetic profiles compared with classical Th1 cells. The clinical significance of Th7R, including the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors and the prediction of postoperative disease-free survival, has been demonstrated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but not in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In this study, we investigated Th7R expression as a predictive marker in patients with extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) who received chemotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy (n = 47). Results showed that Th7R was positively correlated with progression-free survival (PFS) after treatment and that long-term PFS was observed only in patients with Th7R(high) who were treated with anti-programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody combination therapy. Furthermore, high Th7R levels were associated with significantly better overall survival. Th7R showed a positive correlation with GZMB(-)GZMK(+) precursor exhausted CD8(+) T cells (Tpex), which are known target cells for PD-1 blockade therapy. These findings suggest the presence of the Th7R-Tpex axis.

Here, we evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of first-line treatment regimens across different PD-L1 expression, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and T-cell receptor (TCR). METHODS: This study retrospectively recruited 245 patients with AGC. 55 blood samples from 20 patients were prospectively collected before immunotherapy, after two cycles of treatment, and during disease progression. RESULTS: In the CPS < 5 cohort, chemotherapy + PD-1 inhibitor + anti-angiogenic treatment showed a higher progression-free survival (PFS). In the CPS >/= 5 cohort, chemotherapy + PD-1 inhibitor improved median PFS (p = 0.04) and ORR (p = 0.014) over chemotherapy alone. ctDNA analysis revealed that at various time points, patients in the short-PFS group exhibited significantly elevated maxVAF and ctDNA levels. Post-treatment, ctDNA levels decreased in 50% of patients in the long-PFS group, whereas only 25% in the short-PFS group. The short-PFS group had a lower TCR clone count, while no significantly different in the diversity of the TCR repertoire compared with long-PFS groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the different efficacy of first-line treatment regimens across varying levels of PD-L1 expression, and the molecular characteristics of patients with long-term benefits from immunotherapy.",background combin regimen immunotherapi chemotherapi becom standard treatment her2neg advanc gastric cancer agc evalu therapeut efficaci firstlin treatment regimen across differ pdl1 express circul tumor dna ctdna tcell receptor tcr method studi retrospect recruit 245 patient agc 55 blood sampl 20 patient prospect collect immunotherapi two cycl treatment diseas progress result cp 5 cohort chemotherapi pd1 inhibitor antiangiogen treatment show higher progressionfre surviv pf cp 5 cohort chemotherapi pd1 inhibitor improv median pf p 004 orr p 0014 chemotherapi alon ctdna analysi reveal variou time point patient shortpf group exhibit significantli elev maxvaf ctdna level posttreat ctdna level decreas 50 patient longpf group wherea 25 shortpf group shortpf group lower tcr clone count significantli differ divers tcr repertoir compar longpf group conclus find suggest differ efficaci firstlin treatment regimen across vari level pdl1 express molecular characterist patient longterm benefit immunotherapi
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: This proof-of-concept, cross-sectional study assessed the feasibility and clinical relevance of detecting circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and RNA (ctRNA) in plasma of patients with thyroid cancer. The analysis was performed concurrently with clinical and biochemical assessment to explore its value as a complementary tool for postoperative surveillance. METHODS: Thirty-four patients whose primary tumors had been molecularly profiled for key driver mutations and gene fusions were enrolled. Using a tumor-informed strategy, digital PCR assays were designed to detect patient-specific alterations in matched plasma ctDNA and ctRNA collected between 2021 and 2023. Molecular findings were correlated with treatment response categories according to the 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines. METHODS: ctDNA and/or ctRNA were detected in all patients with a structurally incomplete response, showing full concordance with imaging findings. In contrast, 91% of patients with an excellent response had undetectable ctDNA/ctRNA, consistent with remission. Among those with indeterminate and biochemical incomplete response group, results were variable: one patient with undetectable Tg exhibited an ETV6::NTRK3 fusion in cfRNA, while two of three with biochemical incomplete response tested negative for ctDNA/ctRNA. CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional analysis demonstrated that liquid biopsy accurately reflected disease activity and showed strong concordance with primary tumor alterations. These findings support its feasibility and clinical potential as an adjunct to conventional monitoring, particularly when Tg measurement or tumor tissue availability is limited. Prospective longitudinal studies are warranted to validate its role in personalized postoperative surveillance of thyroid cancer.",object proofofconcept crosssect studi assess feasibl clinic relev detect circul tumor dna ctdna rna ctrna plasma patient thyroid cancer analysi perform concurr clinic biochem assess explor valu complementari tool postop surveil method thirtyfour patient whose primari tumor molecularli profil key driver mutat gene fusion enrol use tumorinform strategi digit pcr assay design detect patientspecif alter match plasma ctdna ctrna collect 2021 2023 molecular find correl treatment respons categori accord 2015 american thyroid associ ata guidelin method ctdna andor ctrna detect patient structur incomplet respons show full concord imag find contrast 91 patient excel respons undetect ctdnactrna consist remiss among indetermin biochem incomplet respons group result variabl one patient undetect tg exhibit etv6ntrk3 fusion cfrna two three biochem incomplet respons test neg ctdnactrna conclus crosssect analysi demonstr liquid biopsi accur reflect diseas activ show strong concord primari tumor alter find support feasibl clinic potenti adjunct convent monitor particularli tg measur tumor tissu avail limit prospect longitudin studi warrant valid role person postop surveil thyroid cancer
cancer,"The NRF2 transcription factor is constitutively active in cancer where it functions to maintain oxidative homeostasis and reprogram cellular metabolism. NRF2-active tumors exhibit NRF2-dependency and resistance to chemo/radiotherapy. Here we characterize VVD-065, a first-in-class NRF2 inhibitor that acts via an unprecedented allosteric molecular glue mechanism. In the absence of stress or mutation, NRF2 is rapidly degraded by the KEAP1-CUL3 ubiquitin-ligase complex. VVD-065 specifically and covalently engages Cys151 on KEAP1, which in turn promotes KEAP1-CUL3 complex formation, leading to enhancement of NRF2 degradation. Previously reported Cys151-directed compounds decrease KEAP1-CUL3 interactions and stabilize NRF2, thus establishing KEAP1_Cys151 as a tunable regulator of the KEAP1-CUL3 complex and NRF2 stability. VVD-065 inhibited NRF2-dependent tumor growth and sensitized cancers to chemo/radiotherapy, supporting an open Phase I clinical trial (NCT05954312).",nrf2 transcript factor constitut activ cancer function maintain oxid homeostasi reprogram cellular metabol nrf2activ tumor exhibit nrf2depend resist chemoradiotherapi character vvd065 firstinclass nrf2 inhibitor act via unpreced alloster molecular glue mechan absenc stress mutat nrf2 rapidli degrad keap1cul3 ubiquitinligas complex vvd065 specif coval engag cys151 keap1 turn promot keap1cul3 complex format lead enhanc nrf2 degrad previous report cys151direct compound decreas keap1cul3 interact stabil nrf2 thu establish keap1cys151 tunabl regul keap1cul3 complex nrf2 stabil vvd065 inhibit nrf2depend tumor growth sensit cancer chemoradiotherapi support open phase clinic trial nct05954312
cancer,"Preeclampsia, defined by hypertension and end organ damage after 20 weeks of gestation, remains a significant cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. This disorder has a diverse clinical presentation and is likely driven by several underlying mechanisms, many remaining poorly understood. However, there is emerging evidence that epigenetic regulators, including histone deacetylases (HDACs), may contribute to the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. Of the many HDACs, HDAC9 is particularly intriguing in the context of preeclampsia due to its decreased presence in preeclamptic placenta and prominent role in controlling trophoblast, vascular, and immune behavior, which are often dysregulated in this condition. This review focuses specifically on HDAC9, detailing its expression patterns, molecular properties, known and hypothesized targets at the maternal-fetal interface, and potential causes of dysregulation. Special emphasis is placed on its impact on trophoblast function, immune signaling, angiogenesis, and G-protein-coupled receptor pathways, which are frequently disrupted in preeclampsia. Although current evidence for altered HDAC9 expression in this disorder is confined to the placenta, its potential role in maternal physiology remains an open and important question. By integrating findings from placental biology and disorders with overlapping pathways such as cardiovascular disease and cancer research, this review aims to establish a framework for understanding how HDAC9 contributes to preeclampsia pathogenesis and to identify promising directions for future investigation and therapeutic development.",preeclampsia defin hypertens end organ damag 20 week gestat remain signific caus matern fetal morbid mortal disord divers clinic present like driven sever underli mechan mani remain poorli understood howev emerg evid epigenet regul includ histon deacetylas hdac may contribut pathophysiolog preeclampsia mani hdac hdac9 particularli intrigu context preeclampsia due decreas presenc preeclampt placenta promin role control trophoblast vascular immun behavior often dysregul condit review focus specif hdac9 detail express pattern molecular properti known hypothes target maternalfet interfac potenti caus dysregul special emphasi place impact trophoblast function immun signal angiogenesi gproteincoupl receptor pathway frequent disrupt preeclampsia although current evid alter hdac9 express disord confin placenta potenti role matern physiolog remain open import question integr find placent biolog disord overlap pathway cardiovascular diseas cancer research review aim establish framework understand hdac9 contribut preeclampsia pathogenesi identifi promis direct futur investig therapeut develop
cancer,"Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is an aggressive, therapy-resistant subtype of prostate cancer characterized by lineage plasticity. While metabolic and signaling molecules are increasingly recognized as modulators of tumor progression, their role in cell fate transition remains unclear. NE tumors produce and accumulate serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates diverse physiological processes. Here, we identify a tumor-intrinsic serotonin axis as key driver of NEPC lineage commitment and progression. NEPC endogenously synthesize serotonin via aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (DDC) and reuptake through the transporter SLC6A4. Mechanistically, high level of intracellular serotonin promotes histone serotonylation at H3K4me3Q5, reconfiguring the H3K4me3 chromatin landscape and downstream gene expression, which drives induced NE differentiation and is associated with suppressed androgen receptor signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of 5-HT synthesis using the FDA-approved DDC inhibitor carbidopa significantly impairs tumor growth and prolongs survival in both genetically engineered and patient-derived xenograft models, highlighting histone serotonylation as a druggable vulnerability in NEPC.",neuroendocrin prostat cancer nepc aggress therapyresist subtyp prostat cancer character lineag plastic metabol signal molecul increasingli recogn modul tumor progress role cell fate transit remain unclear ne tumor produc accumul serotonin neurotransmitt regul divers physiolog process identifi tumorintrins serotonin axi key driver nepc lineag commit progress nepc endogen synthes serotonin via aromat lamino acid decarboxylas ddc reuptak transport slc6a4 mechanist high level intracellular serotonin promot histon serotonyl h3k4me3q5 reconfigur h3k4me3 chromatin landscap downstream gene express drive induc ne differenti associ suppress androgen receptor signal pharmacolog inhibit 5ht synthesi use fdaapprov ddc inhibitor carbidopa significantli impair tumor growth prolong surviv genet engin patientderiv xenograft model highlight histon serotonyl druggabl vulner nepc
cancer,"Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represent an emerging targeted cancer therapy approach. However, their poor cell penetration and instability in vivo pose daunting challenges for wide-spread clinical usage. To enhance the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of PROTACs, we introduced extracellular vesicles (EVs) for in vivo PROTAC delivery, which is leveraged by a novel microfluidic droplet-based EV electro-transfection system (muDES). We previously developed YX968 PROTAC, which can selectively degrade both HDAC3 and HDAC8 in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and effectively suppress the tumour cell growth without provoking global hyperacetylation. In this manuscript, we demonstrated that YX968 loaded EVs via the muDES system can retain the optimal integrity of drug loaded EVs with improved loading efficiency compared to other transfection approaches, which, in turn, significantly enhances the therapeutic function of PROTAC in vivo in TNBC mouse models. Intraperitoneal injections of YX968 loaded EVs led to significantly enhanced intratumoral degradation of HDAC3 and HDAC8 than YX986 alone, which resulted in advanced TNBC tumour inhibition without noticeable tissue toxicity. Such EV-based delivery strategy, with a scalable EV loading approach, enhanced the in vivo PROTAC drug stability and bioavailability and improved tissue penetration and targeting, filling an important gap in the clinical translation of PROTAC-based cancer therapy.",proteolysi target chimera protac repres emerg target cancer therapi approach howev poor cell penetr instabl vivo pose daunt challeng widespread clinic usag enhanc vivo therapeut efficaci protac introduc extracellular vesicl ev vivo protac deliveri leverag novel microfluid dropletbas ev electrotransfect system mude previous develop yx968 protac select degrad hdac3 hdac8 tripl neg breast cancer tnbc cell effect suppress tumour cell growth without provok global hyperacetyl manuscript demonstr yx968 load ev via mude system retain optim integr drug load ev improv load effici compar transfect approach turn significantli enhanc therapeut function protac vivo tnbc mous model intraperiton inject yx968 load ev led significantli enhanc intratumor degrad hdac3 hdac8 yx986 alon result advanc tnbc tumour inhibit without notic tissu toxic evbas deliveri strategi scalabl ev load approach enhanc vivo protac drug stabil bioavail improv tissu penetr target fill import gap clinic translat protacbas cancer therapi
cancer,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), such as zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), offer a promising platform for therapeutic protein delivery due to their biocompatibility and tunable degradation properties. However, the clinical translation of protein-loaded MOFs has been limited by poor colloidal stability and a lack of robust, stimulus-responsive release mechanisms. Here, we present a proof-of-concept colloidally stable nanoparticle system composed of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), ZIF-8 and copper (Cu) or iron (Fe) ions, PAA@Cu/FeBSA@c-ZIF-8, designed for H(2)O(2)-responsive, multimodal therapeutic delivery. Through iterative design, we stabilised protein-loaded ZIF-8 nanoparticles with PAA and doped the system with Cu or Fe to enable Fenton-based H(2)O(2) sensitivity. Upon exposure to biologically relevant H(2)O(2) concentrations (40-100 microM), PAA@CuBSA@c-ZIF-8 and PAA@FeBSA@c-ZIF-8 nanoparticles release encapsulated BSA and the doped transition metal ions, demonstrating potential for protein therapy in tandem with reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cytotoxicity. The PAA@BSA@c-ZIF-8, PAA@CuBSA@c-ZIF-8 and PAA@FeBSA@c-ZIF-8 exhibit consistent physiochemical properties across independent operators and scales, including particle size, zeta potential, and cargo release, as well as cytotoxicity. Importantly, we identify ROS production, measured by 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate response, as a key critical quality attribute correlating with therapeutic potency. This work establishes a reproducible, H(2)O(2)-responsive nanoplatform towards application in cancer therapy and supports the broader use of quality attribute metrics in nanoparticle development.",metalorgan framework mof zeolit imidazol framework8 zif8 offer promis platform therapeut protein deliveri due biocompat tunabl degrad properti howev clinic translat proteinload mof limit poor colloid stabil lack robust stimulusrespons releas mechan present proofofconcept colloid stabl nanoparticl system compos polyacryl acid paa bovin serum albumin bsa zif8 copper cu iron fe ion paacufebsaczif8 design h2o2respons multimod therapeut deliveri iter design stabilis proteinload zif8 nanoparticl paa dope system cu fe enabl fentonbas h2o2 sensit upon exposur biolog relev h2o2 concentr 40100 microm paacubsaczif8 paafebsaczif8 nanoparticl releas encapsul bsa dope transit metal ion demonstr potenti protein therapi tandem reactiv oxygen speci rosmedi cytotox paabsaczif8 paacubsaczif8 paafebsaczif8 exhibit consist physiochem properti across independ oper scale includ particl size zeta potenti cargo releas well cytotox importantli identifi ro product measur 27dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacet respons key critic qualiti attribut correl therapeut potenc work establish reproduc h2o2respons nanoplatform toward applic cancer therapi support broader use qualiti attribut metric nanoparticl develop

METHODS: A retrospective review of patients diagnosed with DTC and BM at Tel Aviv Sourasky and Rabin Medical Centers between 1985 and 2024. Clinical features, histopathology, treatments, and survival data were collected. RESULTS: Twenty patients were identified: 11 (55%) had papillary thyroid carcinoma, 8 (40%) had follicular carcinoma and 1 had Hurtle cell carcinoma. BM treatments included neurosurgical resection (n = 9), stereotactic radiosurgery (n = 14), and whole-brain radiotherapy (n = 6). Median survival following BM diagnosis was 16.2 months. Patients who did not undergo surgical resection had significantly shorter survival than those whose BM were resected (13 vs. 80 months, p = 0.03). Survival was also worse among patients receiving systemic therapy at the time BM developed (8.9 vs. 80 months, p = 0.0001).

cancer,"Benz/imidazole-2-thione/selone-based triazoles, particularly their thione and selone analogs, are gaining attention for anticancer drug development due to their structural diversity and biological activity. However, their potential as targeted inhibitors of cancer-related proteins remains underexplored. This study reports the design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel benz/imidazole-2-thione/selone-based triazoles, focusing on cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), a key regulator of cancer cell proliferation. The compounds were synthesized via a multistep approach involving imidazolium salt intermediates, followed by sulfur or selenium incorporation. Structural confirmation was achieved using FT-IR, NMR, and mass spectrometry. Molecular docking against CDK1, TERT, and VEGFR2 revealed strong binding affinities (-9.7 to -7.3 kcal/mol), with CDK1 selected for further in vitro study using MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed stable CDK1 binding for Compounds 2, 4, and 9, although Compound 9 showed conformational instability after 60 ns. ADMET profiling indicated favorable drug-likeness and permeability but highlighted metabolic liabilities and hERG inhibition risks, particularly for Compounds 4 and 9. The target prediction and pathway enrichment analyses predict that benz/imidazole-2-thione/selone-based triazoles exert their pharmacological effects primarily through the regulation of GPCR signaling pathways, likely via direct interaction with key regulators such as RGS8 and RGS4. In vitro assays demonstrated dose-dependent cytotoxicity, with Compound 4 showing the highest potency (IC(50) = 106.12 +/- 1.03 microg/mL), followed by 9 and 2. These findings suggest that benz/imidazole-2-thione/selone-based triazoles are promising CDK1 inhibitors and support their further optimization as targeted breast cancer therapies.",benzimidazole2thioneselonebas triazol particularli thion selon analog gain attent anticanc drug develop due structur divers biolog activ howev potenti target inhibitor cancerrel protein remain underexplor studi report design synthesi evalu novel benzimidazole2thioneselonebas triazol focus cyclindepend kinas 1 cdk1 key regul cancer cell prolifer compound synthes via multistep approach involv imidazolium salt intermedi follow sulfur selenium incorpor structur confirm achiev use ftir nmr mass spectrometri molecular dock cdk1 tert vegfr2 reveal strong bind affin 97 73 kcalmol cdk1 select vitro studi use mcf7 breast cancer cell molecular dynam md simul confirm stabl cdk1 bind compound 2 4 9 although compound 9 show conform instabl 60 ns admet profil indic favor druglik permeabl highlight metabol liabil herg inhibit risk particularli compound 4 9 target predict pathway enrich analys predict benzimidazole2thioneselonebas triazol exert pharmacolog effect primarili regul gpcr signal pathway like via direct interact key regul rgs8 rgs4 vitro assay demonstr dosedepend cytotox compound 4 show highest potenc ic50 10612 103 microgml follow 9 2 find suggest benzimidazole2thioneselonebas triazol promis cdk1 inhibitor support optim target breast cancer therapi
cancer,"BACKGROUND AIMS: Nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine-cisplatin (Gem/Cis/nab-P) had promising efficacy in phase II trials for advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC) but failed to demonstrate superiority in phase III. We investigated Gem/Cis/nab-P efficacy and identified molecular subgroups with clinical benefit. APPROACH RESULTS: This prospective observational cohort study (NCT04871321) enrolled 119 patients with advanced BTC who received Gem/Cis/nab-P from July 2021 to December 2022. Of these, 108 were included in genomic and transcriptomic analyses of pretreatment tumor samples that met quality control criteria. Among 119 patients, 39.5% had intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 37.0% extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 23.5% gallbladder cancer. Most patients had metastatic disease (68.9%). At a median follow-up of 23.7 months, the median progression-free survival was 8.3 months and median overall survival 19.8 months. Grade >/=3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 70 patients (58.8%), and dose reduction was required in 99.2%. Frequent genetic alterations were TP53 (53.7%), KRAS (29.6%), and CDKN2A (20.4%), with TP53 mutations being significantly associated with worse outcomes. Transcriptomic analysis identified four molecular subtypes: cholangiocyte-like, stromal, metabolic, and inflammatory-proliferative. The cholangiocyte-like subtype, marked by increased cholangiocyte markers, had the most favorable prognosis. Stromal and metabolic subtypes showed moderate outcomes, characterized by a fibroblast-rich stroma with activated angiogenesis and enriched metabolic pathways, respectively. The inflammatory-proliferative subtype had the worst prognosis, with cell cycle and inflammatory activation, and an exhausted immune microenvironment. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the clinical activity of Gem/Cis/nab-P in advanced BTC and highlighted that biology-driven patient stratification based on genomic and transcriptomic features may provide important prognostic information.",background aim nabpaclitaxel plu gemcitabinecisplatin gemcisnabp promis efficaci phase ii trial advanc biliari tract cancer btc fail demonstr superior phase iii investig gemcisnabp efficaci identifi molecular subgroup clinic benefit approach result prospect observ cohort studi nct04871321 enrol 119 patient advanc btc receiv gemcisnabp juli 2021 decemb 2022 108 includ genom transcriptom analys pretreat tumor sampl met qualiti control criteria among 119 patient 395 intrahepat cholangiocarcinoma 370 extrahepat cholangiocarcinoma 235 gallbladd cancer patient metastat diseas 689 median followup 237 month median progressionfre surviv 83 month median overal surviv 198 month grade 3 treatmentrel advers event occur 70 patient 588 dose reduct requir 992 frequent genet alter tp53 537 kra 296 cdkn2a 204 tp53 mutat significantli associ wors outcom transcriptom analysi identifi four molecular subtyp cholangiocytelik stromal metabol inflammatoryprolif cholangiocytelik subtyp mark increas cholangiocyt marker favor prognosi stromal metabol subtyp show moder outcom character fibroblastrich stroma activ angiogenesi enrich metabol pathway respect inflammatoryprolif subtyp worst prognosi cell cycl inflammatori activ exhaust immun microenviron conclus studi demonstr clinic activ gemcisnabp advanc btc highlight biologydriven patient stratif base genom transcriptom featur may provid import prognost inform
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Both hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) and conventional intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IP) have shown survival benefits in ovarian cancer (OC), but direct comparisons between the two perfusion modalities are lacking. This study aimed to compare effectiveness and safety between HIPEC and conventional IP in OC. METHODS: This retrospective real-world study analyzed 606 patients with stage Ⅱ-IV OC who received HIPEC or IP following cytoreductive surgery between 2013 and 2024. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Overall survival and adverse events were secondary endpoints. The study used inverse probability of treatment propensity-score weighting. We also conducted sensitivity analyses to evaluate result robustness and subgroup analyses to explore potential effect modification. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 26 months, disease progression occurred in 40.6% of patients in the HIPEC group and 55.0% in the IP group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79; p = 0.103). Mortality rates were 13.2% and 22.5%, respectively (HR 0.83; p = 0.434), showing no significant differences in progression and survival between the two groups. Exploratory subgroup analyses suggested a trend toward improved progression-free outcomes with HIPEC, particularly among patients with BRCA wild-type or BRCA1-mutated tumors and early postoperative perfusion. Hypoalbuminemia was the most common event in both groups (HIPEC 27.2%; IP 15.6%). HIPEC group had more abdominal distension and wound dehiscence, whereas IP patients experienced nausea and rash more frequently. CONCLUSIONS: HIPEC did not significantly improve survival over conventional IP in the overall population, but showed greater benefit in specific subgroups, underscoring the importance of individualized intraperitoneal chemotherapy strategies in OC.",background hypertherm intraperiton chemotherapi hipec convent intraperiton chemotherapi ip shown surviv benefit ovarian cancer oc direct comparison two perfus modal lack studi aim compar effect safeti hipec convent ip oc method retrospect realworld studi analyz 606 patient stage ⅱiv oc receiv hipec ip follow cytoreduct surgeri 2013 2024 primari endpoint progressionfre surviv overal surviv advers event secondari endpoint studi use invers probabl treatment propensityscor weight also conduct sensit analys evalu result robust subgroup analys explor potenti effect modif result median followup 26 month diseas progress occur 406 patient hipec group 550 ip group hazard ratio hr 079 p 0103 mortal rate 132 225 respect hr 083 p 0434 show signific differ progress surviv two group exploratori subgroup analys suggest trend toward improv progressionfre outcom hipec particularli among patient brca wildtyp brca1mut tumor earli postop perfus hypoalbuminemia common event group hipec 272 ip 156 hipec group abdomin distens wound dehisc wherea ip patient experienc nausea rash frequent conclus hipec significantli improv surviv convent ip overal popul show greater benefit specif subgroup underscor import individu intraperiton chemotherapi strategi oc
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Understanding social drivers of mammography screening is critical to implementing breast cancer (BC) screening guidelines that maximize benefits and minimize harms across diverse populations. We examined racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic patterns in guideline-discordant underscreening and overscreening according to guidelines based on age and mortality risk. METHODS: We used 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data and major screening guidelines to define screening participation. Underscreening captured mammography in the past 2 years among women aged 50-74. Overscreening included any mammography beyond age 74 or among women aged 50+ with high mortality risk. We used modified Poisson regression to examine screening by race/ethnicity, regular healthcare provider access, and metropolitan, educational and marital status. RESULTS: Among 88,326 women aged 50-74, compared to non-Hispanic (NH) White, NH American Indian/Alaskan Native (adjusted Prevalence Ratio (aPR)=0.88, 95% CI=0.79-0.97) and NH women of unknown race (aPR=0.86, 95% CI=0.78-0.94) were less likely to be screened, while NH Black (aPR=1.11, 95% CI=1.09-1.13) women were more likely. Among 31,477 women 75+, NH Black women were more likely to be screened than NH White women (aPR=1.07, 95% CI=1.01-1.14). Among women with high mortality risk, NH Black (aPR=1.20, 95% CI=1.12-1.28) women were more likely to be screened than NH White women. Screening was lower among women with more limited socioeconomic resources regardless of age or mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS: Findings reveal social drivers of underscreening and overscreening and the need for equitable BC screening delivery.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Red meat consumption is a risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) and has been linked to tumor alkylating DNA damage. rs16906252-T is a cis expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) variant associated with silencing of MGMT, a central alkylating damage repair gene. We hypothesize that rs16906252-T carriers are predisposed to alkylating damage mutations. METHODS: We conducted mutational signature deconvolution of CRC whole-exome sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n = 540), the Nurses' Health Studies/ Health Professional Follow-up Study (NHS/HPFS, n = 900) as well as non-western samples from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (COCA-CN, n = 295); and examined the relationship of rs16906252-T with putative alkylation-dependent tumor mutations. Leveraging lifestyle data from NHS/HPFS, we also investigated the interaction between red meat consumption and rs16906252-T. RESULTS: Among CRC patients, rs16906252-T carriers exhibited higher tumor alkylating damage compared to non-carriers. In the general population, rs16906252-T is largely absent in individuals with East Asian ancestries, and we consistently find a negligible contribution of alkylating damage in CRC patients with East Asian ancestries. We show that the alkylating mutational signature's carcinogenicity is mainly mediated by KRAS G12D and G13D mutations.

cancer,"With improved survival, non-cancer causes of death have become increasingly relevant in cancer care. Excess non-cancer mortality may reflect treatment-related toxicity, comorbidities, shared risk factors, and psychological distress. This scoping review aimed to map the population-based evidence on the causes of death in patients with cancer and identify research gaps. PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Scopus were searched until April 2025. A total of 203 population-based studies using standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) to compare cause-specific mortality among cancer patients with that of the general population were included. Non-cancer mortality was consistently elevated among patients with cancer (median SMR 1.60; interquartile range (IQR) 1.24-2.51), especially during the first year post-diagnosis (3.42; 1.45-6.92), and remained higher over 10 years post-diagnosis (1.51; 1.08-5.49). Younger patients and those with advanced-stage cancers demonstrated higher non-cancer mortality. Among specific causes, cardiovascular disease (1.37; 1.09-2.34), suicide (1.73; 1.32-2.77), stroke (1.36; 0.98-2.17), infectious diseases in general (2.20; 1.35-4.16), septicemia (2.84; 1.64-5.47), and pneumonia/influenza (1.57; 1.08-2.69) were consistently elevated. Patients with cancer have demonstrated substantial non-cancer mortality. These findings identify priority areas for targeted prevention and further investigation into cause-specific mortality patterns beyond cancer-related deaths to improve outcomes.",improv surviv noncanc caus death becom increasingli relev cancer care excess noncanc mortal may reflect treatmentrel toxic comorbid share risk factor psycholog distress scope review aim map populationbas evid caus death patient cancer identifi research gap pubm web scienc cochran librari embas scopu search april 2025 total 203 populationbas studi use standard mortal ratio smr compar causespecif mortal among cancer patient gener popul includ noncanc mortal consist elev among patient cancer median smr 160 interquartil rang iqr 124251 especi first year postdiagnosi 342 145692 remain higher 10 year postdiagnosi 151 108549 younger patient advancedstag cancer demonstr higher noncanc mortal among specif caus cardiovascular diseas 137 109234 suicid 173 132277 stroke 136 098217 infecti diseas gener 220 135416 septicemia 284 164547 pneumoniainfluenza 157 108269 consist elev patient cancer demonstr substanti noncanc mortal find identifi prioriti area target prevent investig causespecif mortal pattern beyond cancerrel death improv outcom
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that coffee consumption may improve colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis. However, its relevance with respect to dose-response, coffee type, and tumor stage remains unclear. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library through May 31, 2025, to identify studies quantifying coffee intake among CRC patients. Meta-analyses using random-effects models and dose-response analysis were performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and recurrence. Subgroup analyses were stratified by daily intake level, coffee type (caffeinated, decaffeinated, total), and CRC stage. RESULTS: Four prospective cohort studies including 5,442 CRC patients (53% male, 47% female) were analyzed with the following disease stage distribution: I (18%), II (18%), III (39%), IV (21%), unspecified (4%). Coffee consumption was significantly associated with improved OS (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.71-0.85), PFS (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.94), and reduced recurrence (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66-0.91), showing a 4% reduction in hazard per additional cup per day across all outcomes. The strongest OS benefit was observed in stage III disease (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.41-0.81), corresponding to a 10% reduction per cup. CONCLUSIONS: Coffee consumption is associated with improved survival and reduced recurrence in CRC patients in a dose-dependent and stage-specific manner. IMPACT: This meta-analysis demonstrates stage- and type-specific survival benefits in CRC, which may inform more individualized dietary recommendations. It also underscores the need for validation in diverse cohorts and mechanistic studies.",background emerg evid suggest coffe consumpt may improv colorect cancer crc prognosi howev relev respect doserespons coffe type tumor stage remain unclear method systemat search conduct pubm embas cochran librari may 31 2025 identifi studi quantifi coffe intak among crc patient metaanalys use randomeffect model doserespons analysi perform estim hazard ratio hr overal surviv os progressionfre surviv pf recurr subgroup analys stratifi daili intak level coffe type caffein decaffein total crc stage result four prospect cohort studi includ 5442 crc patient 53 male 47 femal analyz follow diseas stage distribut 18 ii 18 iii 39 iv 21 unspecifi 4 coffe consumpt significantli associ improv os hr 078 95 ci 071085 pf hr 084 95 ci 074094 reduc recurr hr 077 95 ci 066091 show 4 reduct hazard per addit cup per day across outcom strongest os benefit observ stage iii diseas hr 057 95 ci 041081 correspond 10 reduct per cup conclus coffe consumpt associ improv surviv reduc recurr crc patient dosedepend stagespecif manner impact metaanalysi demonstr stage typespecif surviv benefit crc may inform individu dietari recommend also underscor need valid divers cohort mechanist studi
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer survivors often experience reduced health-related quality of life (QOL). Diet is related to QOL in the general population and prostate cancer survivors, with benefits observed from greater consumption of a plant-based diet post-treatment. We examined whether post-diagnostic Western and prudent dietary patterns were associated with cancer-specific QOL. METHODS: We studied 1,032 participants in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer (2005-2014). Diet scores were cumulatively averaged from validated food frequency questionnaires post-diagnosis. QOL was assessed with the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Short Form (EPIC-26) 2-5 years after diagnosis/treatment (2010-2016). We assessed associations between the two diet patterns and cancer-specific QOL domains (sexual function, urinary irritation/obstruction, urinary incontinence, bowel function, hormonal/vitality function), adjusting for patient, tumor, and lifestyle characteristics. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was 75 years; 93% had clinically localized cancer. Higher Western diet scores were associated with worse bowel function by 3 points (p-trend=0.02), below the 4-6 point threshold for clinical relevance, with suggestive trends among radiation-treated patients (p-trend=0.07). Higher prudent diet scores tended to be associated with better bowel function (p-trend=0.09). Neither diet score was associated with bowel function among patients receiving radical prostatectomy or active surveillance. There were no associations with sexual, urinary, or hormonal/vitality function. CONCLUSIONS: Among survivors of non-metastatic prostate cancer, dietary patterns were largely unrelated to cancer-specific QOL across domains and treatment subgroups. IMPACT: In the 2-5-year window, QOL was largely unaffected by post-diagnostic dietary patterns, warranting further research with longer follow-up to assess potential latency.",background prostat cancer survivor often experi reduc healthrel qualiti life qol diet relat qol gener popul prostat cancer survivor benefit observ greater consumpt plantbas diet posttreat examin whether postdiagnost western prudent dietari pattern associ cancerspecif qol method studi 1032 particip health profession followup studi diagnos nonmetastat prostat cancer 20052014 diet score cumul averag valid food frequenc questionnair postdiagnosi qol assess expand prostat cancer index composit short form epic26 25 year diagnosistreat 20102016 assess associ two diet pattern cancerspecif qol domain sexual function urinari irritationobstruct urinari incontin bowel function hormonalvit function adjust patient tumor lifestyl characterist result median age diagnosi 75 year 93 clinic local cancer higher western diet score associ wors bowel function 3 point ptrend002 46 point threshold clinic relev suggest trend among radiationtr patient ptrend007 higher prudent diet score tend associ better bowel function ptrend009 neither diet score associ bowel function among patient receiv radic prostatectomi activ surveil associ sexual urinari hormonalvit function conclus among survivor nonmetastat prostat cancer dietari pattern larg unrel cancerspecif qol across domain treatment subgroup impact 25year window qol larg unaffect postdiagnost dietari pattern warrant research longer followup assess potenti latenc
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the application value of Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE) in prostate biopsy. METHODS: All consecutive subjects who attended our clinic to underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-ultrasound fusion biopsy due to highly suspicious findings on MRI for prostate cancer (PCa) and met the inclusion criteria were enrolled into our prospective study between October 2020 and January 2025. ROSE was performed concurrently in the same operating room with MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy. For each lesion with Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 4-5, one to two additional needle passes were taken for ROSE, in addition to the standard biopsy. The results of ROSE during the biopsy were recorded. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of ROSE were assessed using paraffin-embedded histopathology of the biopsy specimens as the gold standard. RESULTS: A total of 313 lesions with PI-RADS 4-5 from 147 patients were ultimately included in this study. All biopsies were performed smoothly, with no severe complications occurring postoperatively. 192 lesions were pathologically diagnosed with PCa, yielding a positive detection rate of 61.3% (192/313). With paraffin-embedded histopathology of the biopsy specimens serving as the gold standard, the sensitivity of ROSE for detecting PCa was 71.9% (138/192), specificity was 100% (121/121), accuracy was 82.7% (259/313), positive predictive value was 100% (138/138), and negative predictive value was 69.1% (121/175). CONCLUSIONS: The application of ROSE technology in the diagnosis during prostate biopsy is accurate and reliable, with specificity and positive predictive value both reaching 100%.",object investig applic valu rapid onsit evalu rose prostat biopsi method consecut subject attend clinic underw magnet reson imag mriultrasound fusion biopsi due highli suspici find mri prostat cancer pca met inclus criteria enrol prospect studi octob 2020 januari 2025 rose perform concurr oper room mriultrasound fusion biopsi lesion prostat imagingreport data system pirad 45 one two addit needl pass taken rose addit standard biopsi result rose biopsi record sensit specif posit predict valu neg predict valu rose assess use paraffinembed histopatholog biopsi specimen gold standard result total 313 lesion pirad 45 147 patient ultim includ studi biopsi perform smoothli sever complic occur postop 192 lesion patholog diagnos pca yield posit detect rate 613 192313 paraffinembed histopatholog biopsi specimen serv gold standard sensit rose detect pca 719 138192 specif 100 121121 accuraci 827 259313 posit predict valu 100 138138 neg predict valu 691 121175 conclus applic rose technolog diagnosi prostat biopsi accur reliabl specif posit predict valu reach 100

We report updated efficacy and safety results from the disease-free survival (DFS) final and overall survival (OS) second interim analyses, with >/= 5 years of follow-up in Japanese patients. Patients who received 1-4 21-day chemotherapy cycles after surgery were randomized 1:1 to receive atezolizumab 1200 mg every 3 weeks (</= 16 cycles) or BSC. Of 149 patients enrolled, 117 were randomized to the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (atezolizumab n = 59; BSC n = 58). At data cutoff (January 26, 2024), unstratified hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for DFS in the atezolizumab versus BSC arms were 0.54 (0.28-1.07) in the stage II-IIIA programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor cell (TC) >/= 1% (n = 74), 0.64 (0.27-1.52) in the stage II-IIIA PD-L1 TC 1%-49% (n = 34), 0.52 (0.17-1.54) in the stage II-IIIA PD-L1 TC >/= 50% (n = 40), 0.58 (0.34-1.00) in the stage II-IIIA all-randomized (n = 113), and 0.57 (0.34-0.98) in the ITT populations. OS remained immature; median OS was not reached in both treatment arms for all subgroups.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen in cystic fibrosis-related chronic rhinosinusitis (CF-CRS) that produces phenazine metabolites pyocyanin and 1-hydroxyphenazine (1-HP), which may have detrimental effects on mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca(2+) signaling, and apoptosis. However, prior studies utilized lung cancer cells or dissociated animal cells. We sought to better define human nasal epithelial responses to phenazines, including the role of Ca(2+). METHODS: Live cell imaging was used to measure Ca(2+) and mitochondrial function in RPMI2650 nasal carcinoma cells and primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) cultured in submersion and at air-liquid interface (ALI). Gene expression was measured by quantitative PCR. Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was quantified by high-speed imaging. RESULTS: Pyocyanin, but not 1-HP, increased mitochondrial Ca(2+) dependent on phospholipase C and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) release, correlating with protein kinase C activation. Mitochondrial membrane potential decreased and mitochondrial ROS increased with both pyocyanin and 1-HP in a Ca(2+)-independent manner. Both pyocyanin and 1-HP decreased viability of RPMI2650s and other squamous carcinoma cell lines over 24 h, whereas HNECs survived, possibly due to differential regulation of protein homeostasis genes, including activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Mitochondrial ROS was enhanced in CF-CRS ALIs, which may explain why pyocyanin reduced CBF in CF but not non-CF ALIs. CONCLUSIONS: Ca(2+) signaling is not required for phenazine mitochondrial toxicity. The greater sensitivity of cancer cells to phenazine cytotoxicity necessitates use of primary cells when studying host responses to bacterial phenazines. Enhanced ROS production and ciliotoxicity in CF-CRS may contribute to susceptibility to P. aeruginosa infection.",background pseudomona aeruginosa opportunist pathogen cystic fibrosisrel chronic rhinosinus cfcr produc phenazin metabolit pyocyanin 1hydroxyphenazin 1hp may detriment effect mitochondria reactiv oxygen speci ro ca2 signal apoptosi howev prior studi util lung cancer cell dissoci anim cell sought better defin human nasal epitheli respons phenazin includ role ca2 method live cell imag use measur ca2 mitochondri function rpmi2650 nasal carcinoma cell primari human nasal epitheli cell hnec cultur submers airliquid interfac ali gene express measur quantit pcr ciliari beat frequenc cbf quantifi highspe imag result pyocyanin 1hp increas mitochondri ca2 depend phospholipas c endoplasm reticulum er ca2 releas correl protein kinas c activ mitochondri membran potenti decreas mitochondri ro increas pyocyanin 1hp ca2independ manner pyocyanin 1hp decreas viabil rpmi2650 squamou carcinoma cell line 24 h wherea hnec surviv possibl due differenti regul protein homeostasi gene includ activ transcript factor 6 atf6 mitochondri ro enhanc cfcr ali may explain pyocyanin reduc cbf cf noncf ali conclus ca2 signal requir phenazin mitochondri toxic greater sensit cancer cell phenazin cytotox necessit use primari cell studi host respons bacteri phenazin enhanc ro product ciliotox cfcr may contribut suscept p aeruginosa infect
cancer,"The development of smart, selective, and multifunctional nanotherapeutics is crucial for advancing next-generation cancer treatments. In this study, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoclusters (SPIONCs) were coated with mesoporous silica, functionalized with folic acid (FA), and co-loaded with curcumin (CUR) and capecitabine (CAPE) to create a novel nanocarrier system. To enhance cellular internalisation, magnetophoresis was applied before exposure of the cells to cold atmospheric plasma (CAP). The resulting FA-conjugated, CUR and CAPE-loaded nanoclusters were evaluated in vitro in MCF-7 breast cancer and HME-1 normal epithelial cells at varying CAP exposure durations (0, 10, and 20 s) and incubation times (24 and 48 h). This is the first report demonstrating the co-loading of CUR and CAPE into FA-functionalised mesoporous silica-coated magnetic nanoclusters. Drug release studies revealed significantly enhanced release profiles under acidic conditions (pH 5.0 and 6.5), mimicking lysosomal and tumour microenvironments, compared to physiological pH (7.4). Drug-loaded nanoclusters exhibited substantially higher cytotoxicity than the controls with no loading, with a more pronounced effect in MCF-7 cells. Notably, the combined treatment of CAP and CUR-CAPE loaded NCs showed a synergistic cytotoxic effect. IC(50) values, after 10 s CAP exposure and 24 h incubation, decreased to 0.43 microg mL(-1) for MCF-7 cells and 37 microg mL(-1) for HME-1 cells. The elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by CAP played a key role in the observed cytotoxic effects, and both CUR and CAPE were found to enhance this process through ROS-related and potentially additional molecular pathways. These findings highlight the potential of CAP-assisted multicomponent nanocarriers as a promising platform for effective cancer therapy.",develop smart select multifunct nanotherapeut crucial advanc nextgener cancer treatment studi superparamagnet iron oxid nanoclust spionc coat mesopor silica function folic acid fa coload curcumin cur capecitabin cape creat novel nanocarri system enhanc cellular internalis magnetophoresi appli exposur cell cold atmospher plasma cap result faconjug cur capeload nanoclust evalu vitro mcf7 breast cancer hme1 normal epitheli cell vari cap exposur durat 0 10 20 incub time 24 48 h first report demonstr coload cur cape fafunctionalis mesopor silicaco magnet nanoclust drug releas studi reveal significantli enhanc releas profil acid condit ph 50 65 mimick lysosom tumour microenviron compar physiolog ph 74 drugload nanoclust exhibit substanti higher cytotox control load pronounc effect mcf7 cell notabl combin treatment cap curcap load nc show synergist cytotox effect ic50 valu 10 cap exposur 24 h incub decreas 043 microg ml1 mcf7 cell 37 microg ml1 hme1 cell elev level reactiv oxygen speci ro induc cap play key role observ cytotox effect cur cape found enhanc process rosrel potenti addit molecular pathway find highlight potenti capassist multicompon nanocarri promis platform effect cancer therapi
cancer,"In the present study, three kinds of curcuminoids (CS)-loaded micelles (CS-NPGS) were prepared by the solid dispersion method using novel Nitogenin polyethylene glycol succinate-1000 (NPGS-1000) to enhance the solubility and bioavailability. The micelles were characterized using a particle size analyzer, a crystallography analyzer, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The morphology was screened using a scanning electron microscope. In vitro release profiles of curcumin from CS-NPGS showed a sustained release without rapid burst. Treating triple negative MDA-MB-231 cell lines with all micelles remarkably exhibited dose-dependent toxicity and inhibited the cell proliferation. Epifluorescence was used to evaluate the morphology of the treated cells by using various stains. The IC50 values of the curcumin-loaded micelles against triple negative MDA-MB-231 cells were 10.85, 5.43, and 5.43 mug/mL for CS-NPGS-1, CS-NPGS-2, and CS-NPGS-3, respectively, lower than the one of free curcumin (21.7 mug/mL).

cancer,"Previous studies have demonstrated a higher prevalence of keratinocyte carcinomas (KC) on sun-exposed areas, particularly for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) compared to basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Few studies in the United States (US) have compared the prevalence of BCC to SCC by anatomical location. The aim of this study was to determine the KC prevalence in a Midwestern US population standardised by relative tumour density (RTD) per anatomical area, which has not been previously reported in the US. Data was collected from Veterans Affairs' patients with biopsy-proven KCs from October 1999 to September 2020. KCs were divided into BCCs and SCCs. RTD was calculated by standardising frequency of occurrence in a location by body surface area. The proportion of BCCs to SCCs for each location was also analysed. A total of 31 663 KCs (17 776 BCCs and 13 887 SCCs) were identified in 10 933 patients, with the majority on the head and neck. BCCs were more likely overall on the trunk and upper arms than SCCs. SCCs were more common on the hands, forearms, genitals/perineum/perianal area, and ears. Both BCC and SCC occurred more frequently over sun-exposed areas when controlling for body surface area of the location. Higher proportions of BCCs were found on sun-protected areas when compared to SCCs. The relative preponderance of SCCs on the genitals/perineum/perianal area may be due to human papillomavirus.",previou studi demonstr higher preval keratinocyt carcinoma kc sunexpos area particularli squamou cell carcinoma scc compar basal cell carcinoma bcc studi unit state us compar preval bcc scc anatom locat aim studi determin kc preval midwestern us popul standardis rel tumour densiti rtd per anatom area previous report us data collect veteran affair patient biopsyproven kc octob 1999 septemb 2020 kc divid bcc scc rtd calcul standardis frequenc occurr locat bodi surfac area proport bcc scc locat also analys total 31 663 kc 17 776 bcc 13 887 scc identifi 10 933 patient major head neck bcc like overal trunk upper arm scc scc common hand forearm genitalsperineumperian area ear bcc scc occur frequent sunexpos area control bodi surfac area locat higher proport bcc found sunprotect area compar scc rel preponder scc genitalsperineumperian area may due human papillomaviru
cancer,"Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, emphasizing the need for advanced and accurate diagnostic tools. This research paper focuses on the application of a Transfer Learning model for the detection of breast cancer in mammography images. Leveraging the power of deep learning, Transfer Learning enables the utilization of pre-trained models on large datasets, optimizing performance even with limited data availability. The study employs a diverse dataset comprising mammography images from various sources, ensuring a comprehensive representation of breast cancer cases. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, pre-trained on a vast dataset, is fine-tuned using the mammography dataset to harness its feature extraction capabilities for breast cancer detection. This approach allows the model to learn intricate patterns and abnormalities indicative of malignancies. Key steps involve the pre-processing of mammography images to enhance the quality and extraction of relevant features through the Transfer Learning model. The research investigates the model's efficacy in distinguishing between benign and malignant cases, evaluating its accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. The research proposed EfficientNet B3 with a DenseNet transfer learning model for classifying mammography images into benign or malignant categories. Also, the impact of varying architectures and hyperparameters on the model's performance is explored for optimization. Results demonstrate promising outcomes, with the Transfer Learning model exhibiting a high degree of accuracy in breast cancer detection. The model's ability to generalize across diverse datasets underscores its robustness and potential for real-world clinical applications. Visions gained from this research contribute to the ongoing discourse on the integration of advanced technologies in breast cancer diagnostics. This research signifies a crucial step towards enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer detection, emphasizing the potential of Transfer Learning in revolutionizing mammography-based diagnostic approaches. Findings show that the EfficientNet-B3 and DenseNet have loss values ranging between 0.9, while VGG16's loss values are significantly higher, ranging from 7. The findings hold implications for improving early detection, facilitating timely interventions, and ultimately advancing outcomes for individuals at risk of breast cancer.",breast cancer remain signific global health concern emphas need advanc accur diagnost tool research paper focus applic transfer learn model detect breast cancer mammographi imag leverag power deep learn transfer learn enabl util pretrain model larg dataset optim perform even limit data avail studi employ divers dataset compris mammographi imag variou sourc ensur comprehens represent breast cancer case convolut neural network cnn architectur pretrain vast dataset finetun use mammographi dataset har featur extract capabl breast cancer detect approach allow model learn intric pattern abnorm indic malign key step involv preprocess mammographi imag enhanc qualiti extract relev featur transfer learn model research investig model efficaci distinguish benign malign case evalu accuraci sensit specif precis research propos efficientnet b3 densenet transfer learn model classifi mammographi imag benign malign categori also impact vari architectur hyperparamet model perform explor optim result demonstr promis outcom transfer learn model exhibit high degre accuraci breast cancer detect model abil gener across divers dataset underscor robust potenti realworld clinic applic vision gain research contribut ongo discours integr advanc technolog breast cancer diagnost research signifi crucial step toward enhanc accuraci effici breast cancer detect emphas potenti transfer learn revolution mammographybas diagnost approach find show efficientnetb3 densenet loss valu rang 09 vgg16 loss valu significantli higher rang 7 find hold implic improv earli detect facilit time intervent ultim advanc outcom individu risk breast cancer
cancer,"CHEK2 is a moderate-penetrance tumor suppressor gene primarily linked to hereditary breast cancer, yet growing evidence implicates it in a wider tumor spectrum. Data from underrepresented populations, such as Turkiye, remains limited. We retrospectively analyzed 895 individuals referred for hereditary cancer evaluation between 2019 and 2025 who underwent multigene panel testing. Germline CHEK2 variants were identified using the Hereditary Cancer Solution Kit (Sophia Genetics) and classified per ACMG guidelines. Clinical, tumor, and histopathological data were reviewed. Twenty-four carriers (83.3% female) were detected: 45.8% harbored pathogenic, 41.6% likely pathogenic, and 12.5% variant of uncertain significance.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) offer immense potential in reproductive medicine, particularly for males who lack germ cells and cannot achieve biological parenthood through conventional ARTs. Early efforts to derive human germ cells from stem cells were hindered by low efficiency, subpar characterization, and the lack of standardized differentiation approaches. However, recent advancements have led to the development of defined protocols that mimic early embryonic development and allow the specification of transcriptomically and epigenetically validated human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs). Current research focuses on maturing hPGCLCs in vitro, particularly within 3D culture systems that resemble their physiological microenvironment, with the aim of producing transplantable hiPSC-derived spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) or differentiating them to sperm. At the same time, researchers are also testing whether hiPSCs generated from infertile patients can resume germline differentiation. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: This narrative review aimed to summarize the key efforts and remaining challenges in differentiating male germ cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), with a particular focus on defined and validated protocols for hPGCLC specification. In parallel, we addressed key safety and ethical considerations that must be accounted for the development of clinical applications. A deeper understanding of the approaching therapeutic use of hiPSCs in reproductive medicine is essential for developing novel regenerative fertility strategies. SEARCH METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for studies attempting germ cell differentiation from hPSCs using relevant keywords ('stem cells', 'human pluripotent stem cells', 'human embryonic stem cells', 'human induced pluripotent stem cells', 'somatic cell reprogramming', 'infertility', 'germline', 'spermatogenesis', 'germ cells', and 'primordial germ cells'). No time period restriction was established. Studies with an exclusive focus on female germline differentiation were excluded. To maintain a human-focused perspective, only key animal studies are presented. OUTCOMES: The literature reveals a clear segregation among protocols for deriving germ cells from hPSCs, particularly between earlier studies lacking standardized differentiation conditions and characterization, and the most recent, defined protocols having transcriptomic and epigenetic validation against in vivo hPGCs. Moreover, during the last decade, the field has seen remarkable progress, with multiple efforts aimed at maturing hPGCLCs, closely recapitulating late male embryonic germline development. Additionally, hiPSCs derived from male patients at risk of infertility, particularly those without underlying genetic syndromes, generally retain the capacity for early germline commitment. While attempts at maturating patient germ cells beyond the hPGCLC state remain limited, the rapid pace of discovery and refinement in recent years suggests that further breakthroughs, including clinically applicable fertility restoration strategies, are likely to be achieved in the near future. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The ability to generate hiPSCs from infertile patients and to specify them into hPGCLCs supports the feasibility of obtaining hiPSC-derived SSCs for future therapeutic use. These advances raise important ethical, regulatory, and societal questions that must be actively discussed among researchers, clinicians, policymakers, and the general public to ensure responsible and equitable access to these technologies.

cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy in the digestive tract. Serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2) plays a critical role in CRC progression, and its regulatory mechanisms warrant further investigation. The regulatory role of SHMT2 was investigated by assessing cell viability and ferroptosis. RNA methylation detection was performed to determine the predominant methylation modification types. The interaction between GEMIN5 (which binds to the m(7)G cap) was analyzed through RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and dual luciferase reporter assays. Finally, the synergistic regulation of GEMIN5 and SHMT2 on the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway was examined. SHMT2 was highly expressed in CRC tissues, and its inhibition suppressed cell viability while promoting ferroptosis. Quantitative analysis revealed significantly elevated m(7)G levels in CRC cells. GEMIN5 expression positively correlated with SHMT2 levels in CRC, and GEMIN5 overexpression increased m(7)G modification levels of SHMT2 mRNA. RIP assays demonstrated that SHMT2 mRNA could be enriched in GEMIN5 complexes, with GEMIN5 overexpression inhibiting SHMT2 mRNA degradation. SHMT2 overexpression counteracted the effects of GEMIN5 knockdown, while GEMIN5 overexpression prominently reversed the regulatory effects of SHMT2 knockdown on beta-catenin and GSK3beta protein expression. GEMIN5-mediated m(7)G modification stabilizes high SHMT2 expression, which inhibits CRC cell ferroptosis and activates the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in vitro.",colorect cancer crc common malign digest tract serin hydroxymethyltransferas 2 shmt2 play critic role crc progress regulatori mechan warrant investig regulatori role shmt2 investig assess cell viabil ferroptosi rna methyl detect perform determin predomin methyl modif type interact gemin5 bind m7g cap analyz rna immunoprecipit rip dual luciferas report assay final synergist regul gemin5 shmt2 wntbetacatenin signal pathway examin shmt2 highli express crc tissu inhibit suppress cell viabil promot ferroptosi quantit analysi reveal significantli elev m7g level crc cell gemin5 express posit correl shmt2 level crc gemin5 overexpress increas m7g modif level shmt2 mrna rip assay demonstr shmt2 mrna could enrich gemin5 complex gemin5 overexpress inhibit shmt2 mrna degrad shmt2 overexpress counteract effect gemin5 knockdown gemin5 overexpress promin revers regulatori effect shmt2 knockdown betacatenin gsk3beta protein express gemin5medi m7g modif stabil high shmt2 express inhibit crc cell ferroptosi activ wntbetacatenin signal pathway vitro
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Dietary nitrate, through conversion to nitric oxide, which supports vascular and nervous system function, may lower dementia risk but may also form neurodegenerative N-nitrosamines, depending on the nitrate source. METHODS: We investigated associations between source-specific nitrate and nitrite intake and incident and early-onset dementia (<65 years) in 54,804 dementia-free participants from the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health Cohort Study over  approximately 27 years. Nitrate and nitrite intakes were derived from food frequency questionnaires and nitrate and nitrite databases. RESULTS: Higher plant-sourced nitrate intake was non-linearly associated with lower rates of incident dementia (fifth vs first quintile hazard ratio 95% confidence interval: 0.90 [0.83, 0.98]), while increased risk was seen for higher intakes of animal-sourced, additive-permitted meat-sourced, and tap water-sourced nitrate. Similar associations were seen for source-specific nitrite intake and were more pronounced for early-onset dementia. No clear effect modification was observed. DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the importance of nitrate source in dementia risk and warrant further investigation. HIGHLIGHTS: Plant nitrate is associated with a lower risk of incident and early-onset dementia. Animal and tap water nitrate are associated with an increased risk of dementia. Encouraging consumption of plant-based nitrate sources may lower risk of dementia.",introduct dietari nitrat convers nitric oxid support vascular nervou system function may lower dementia risk may also form neurodegen nnitrosamin depend nitrat sourc method investig associ sourcespecif nitrat nitrit intak incid earlyonset dementia 65 year 54804 dementiafre particip danish diet cancer health cohort studi approxim 27 year nitrat nitrit intak deriv food frequenc questionnair nitrat nitrit databas result higher plantsourc nitrat intak nonlinearli associ lower rate incid dementia fifth vs first quintil hazard ratio 95 confid interv 090 083 098 increas risk seen higher intak animalsourc additivepermit meatsourc tap watersourc nitrat similar associ seen sourcespecif nitrit intak pronounc earlyonset dementia clear effect modif observ discuss find highlight import nitrat sourc dementia risk warrant investig highlight plant nitrat associ lower risk incid earlyonset dementia anim tap water nitrat associ increas risk dementia encourag consumpt plantbas nitrat sourc may lower risk dementia

cancer,"Colon cancer is one of the five most common cancers worldwide, leading to more than 500.000 deaths annually. It is known that the prevalence of colon cancer increases in parallel with increasing age, which is often associated with an increase in the number of concomitant diseases. The latter, both individually and in combination with each other, can have an impact on the safety of performing surgical interventions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between somatic status and the incidence of postoperative complications in comorbid patients with locally advanced colon cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was prospective in nature. The study included 254 patients who underwent surgery for locally advanced colon cancer (cT4N0M0, cT1-4 N1-2 M0). 66.1% of patients had stage II of the disease, 33.9% of patients had stage III. Information on somatic status was analyzed for all patients with the calculation of the Charlson comorbidity index, as well as on the presence of complications in the early and late postoperative period. Statistical data analysis was performed using the RStudio software (version 2024.12.1+563) in the R programming language. RESULTS: Various complications of surgical interventions in patients with locally advanced colon cancer were noted in 9.8% of cases. A total of 42 complications were identified in 25 patients. The most common complication was the formation of a postoperative hernia, which occurred in 11 patients (44.0% of all complications and 4.3% of the total sample). The second most common complication was seromas, which formed in 9 patients (36.0% of all complications and 3.5% of the total sample). In the course of a multifactorial logistic regression analysis, it was shown that the independent risk factors for postoperative complications in comorbid patients with locally advanced colon cancer are the duration of surgery and the Charlson comorbidity index. Thus, an operation duration of more than 240 minutes increases the chance of postoperative complications by 3.1 times (OR=3.100; 95% CI=1.250-7.681; p=0.015), and the Charlson comorbidity index of 9 or more increases the chance of postoperative complications by 4.927 times (OR=4.927; 95% CI=1.340-18.122; p=0.016). CONCLUSION: The somatic status of patients has a significant impact on the postoperative complications of radical surgical interventions in patients with locally advanced colon cancer. At the same time, it is most appropriate not to evaluate individual concomitant diseases, but a comprehensive assessment of somatic status using the Charlson comorbidity index, which, along with the duration of surgery, acts as an independent predictor of postoperative complications.",colon cancer one five common cancer worldwid lead 500000 death annual known preval colon cancer increas parallel increas age often associ increas number concomit diseas latter individu combin impact safeti perform surgic intervent object evalu relationship somat statu incid postop complic comorbid patient local advanc colon cancer materi method studi prospect natur studi includ 254 patient underw surgeri local advanc colon cancer ct4n0m0 ct14 n12 m0 661 patient stage ii diseas 339 patient stage iii inform somat statu analyz patient calcul charlson comorbid index well presenc complic earli late postop period statist data analysi perform use rstudio softwar version 2024121563 r program languag result variou complic surgic intervent patient local advanc colon cancer note 98 case total 42 complic identifi 25 patient common complic format postop hernia occur 11 patient 440 complic 43 total sampl second common complic seroma form 9 patient 360 complic 35 total sampl cours multifactori logist regress analysi shown independ risk factor postop complic comorbid patient local advanc colon cancer durat surgeri charlson comorbid index thu oper durat 240 minut increas chanc postop complic 31 time or3100 95 ci12507681 p0015 charlson comorbid index 9 increas chanc postop complic 4927 time or4927 95 ci134018122 p0016 conclus somat statu patient signific impact postop complic radic surgic intervent patient local advanc colon cancer time appropri evalu individu concomit diseas comprehens assess somat statu use charlson comorbid index along durat surgeri act independ predictor postop complic
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To determine prognostic factors in resectable common bile duct (CBD) cancer and feasibility of adjuvant therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied the results of pancreatoduodenectomy for CBD cancer in 1999-2023. RESULTS: There were 89 patients, mortality rate was 5.6% (n=5), complications developed in 66 patients (74.2%), complications >/= grade III - in 37 (41.7%) cases. Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) grade B/C was detected in 29 (32.6%) cases. Postoperative chemotherapy was administered to 43 patients (gemcitabine-based therapy - 27, capecitabine alone - 15, capecitabine/oxaliplatin combination - 1). The median overall survival was 33 months, disease-free survival - 19 months. Among patients selected for assessment of long-term results (n=79), the median OS was 37 months, DFS - 30 months. Retroperitoneal invasion (RPI), pancreatic invasion (PI), perineural invasion (PNI), moderate/poor differentiation, R1 resection, retroperitoneal lymph node (LN) involvement worsened long-term results in multivariate analysis, regional LN involvement and elevated CA 19-9 - in univariate analysis. Accumulation of factors worsened prognosis. Postoperative chemotherapy improved OS (median OS 35 months vs. 16.5, p=0.035) in patients with two or more negative prognostic factors. Chemotherapy mode did not affect prognosis. CONCLUSION: Retroperitoneal, pancreatic and perineural invasion, R1 resection, moderate/poor tumor differentiation, lymph node involvement and elevated CA 19-9 are negative prognostic factors in CBD cancer. Postoperative capecitabine monotherapy is justified in patients with two or more negative factors.",object determin prognost factor resect common bile duct cbd cancer feasibl adjuv therapi materi method retrospect studi result pancreatoduodenectomi cbd cancer 19992023 result 89 patient mortal rate 56 n5 complic develop 66 patient 742 complic grade iii 37 417 case postop pancreat fistula popf grade bc detect 29 326 case postop chemotherapi administ 43 patient gemcitabinebas therapi 27 capecitabin alon 15 capecitabineoxaliplatin combin 1 median overal surviv 33 month diseasefre surviv 19 month among patient select assess longterm result n79 median os 37 month df 30 month retroperiton invas rpi pancreat invas pi perineur invas pni moderatepoor differenti r1 resect retroperiton lymph node ln involv worsen longterm result multivari analysi region ln involv elev ca 199 univari analysi accumul factor worsen prognosi postop chemotherapi improv os median os 35 month vs 165 p0035 patient two neg prognost factor chemotherapi mode affect prognosi conclus retroperiton pancreat perineur invas r1 resect moderatepoor tumor differenti lymph node involv elev ca 199 neg prognost factor cbd cancer postop capecitabin monotherapi justifi patient two neg factor
cancer,"Papillary cancer comprises 85-90% of malignant thyroid tumors. About 50% of new cases of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) are malignant tumors up to 1 cm in size. In Europe, their proportion increased from 18% to 40% over 30 years. This is explained by better diagnosis at earlier stages of disease due to higher quality of ultrasound diagnosis. According to the WHO classification, tumor </=1 cm is defined as papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC). In the absence of regional or distant metastases, either follow-up or hemithyroidectomy is recommended. However, tumor metastasis to lymph nodes of the neck is quite common that can contribute to recurrence. Modern ultrasonic diagnosis allows effective preclinical detection of lymph node metastases. In this report, we consider the methods of recurrence detection using retrospective preoperative data in patients who underwent hemithyroidectomy and in whom treatment outcomes are known (presence/absence of recurrence).",papillari cancer compris 8590 malign thyroid tumor 50 new case papillari thyroid cancer ptc malign tumor 1 cm size europ proport increas 18 40 30 year explain better diagnosi earlier stage diseas due higher qualiti ultrasound diagnosi accord classif tumor 1 cm defin papillari thyroid microcarcinoma ptmc absenc region distant metastas either followup hemithyroidectomi recommend howev tumor metastasi lymph node neck quit common contribut recurr modern ultrason diagnosi allow effect preclin detect lymph node metastas report consid method recurr detect use retrospect preoper data patient underw hemithyroidectomi treatment outcom known presenceabs recurr

cancer,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Sarcopenia, characterized by the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, has been linked to poor oncological outcomes. This study aimed to assess the relationship between sarcopenia-defined through combined radiological and biochemical assessments-and survival outcomes in patients with rectal cancer. METHODS: Sarcopenia was evaluated using radiological measurements of skeletal muscle mass, visceral and subcutaneous fat tissue volumes, and biochemical parameters including albumin, protein, and Fib-4 index levels. RESULTS: Deceased patients were older than survivors (mean 70 vs. 63years). Elevated Fib-4 scores (3.0-4.9) were mainly observed in non-operated patients with poor tumor regression. Post-treatment albumin levels were significantly higher in patients with complete response (42.0+/-3.5mg/dL) than in those with regression score-3 (37.3+/-8.7mg/dL) and non-operated patients (34.9+/-8.3mg/dL; p < 0.001). Pre-treatment skeletal muscle mass, subcutaneous fat, and visceral fat volumes were greater in survivors (22.3+/-7.0cm3 vs 19.2+/-7.0cm3, 27.7+/-20.3cm3 vs 18.7+/-14.0cm3 and 49.7+/-37.8cm3 vs 29.9+/-20.5cm3 respectively) than in deceased patients (p < 0.05). Larger tissue volumes-muscle>/=16.95cm3, visceral fat>/=39.35cm3, and subcutaneous fat>/=17.65 cm3 were associated with longer overall survival. In univariate analysis, older age, low albumin, high Fib-4 index, and reduced tissue volumes predicted poorer survival, while multivariate analysis identified low post-treatment albumin as the only independent prognostic factor (HR 0.28, 95% CI:0.12-0.65, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia is associated with decreased overall survival in rectal cancer. In patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy, lower volumes of muscle mass, subcutaneous fat, and visceral fat, together with lower albumin and protein levels and higher Fib-4 scores, may serve as predictive markers of sarcopenia.",backgroundobject sarcopenia character progress loss skelet muscl mass function link poor oncolog outcom studi aim assess relationship sarcopeniadefin combin radiolog biochem assessmentsand surviv outcom patient rectal cancer method sarcopenia evalu use radiolog measur skelet muscl mass viscer subcutan fat tissu volum biochem paramet includ albumin protein fib4 index level result deceas patient older survivor mean 70 vs 63year elev fib4 score 3049 mainli observ nonoper patient poor tumor regress posttreat albumin level significantli higher patient complet respons 42035mgdl regress score3 37387mgdl nonoper patient 34983mgdl p 0001 pretreat skelet muscl mass subcutan fat viscer fat volum greater survivor 22370cm3 vs 19270cm3 277203cm3 vs 187140cm3 497378cm3 vs 299205cm3 respect deceas patient p 005 larger tissu volumesmuscle1695cm3 viscer fat3935cm3 subcutan fat1765 cm3 associ longer overal surviv univari analysi older age low albumin high fib4 index reduc tissu volum predict poorer surviv multivari analysi identifi low posttreat albumin independ prognost factor hr 028 95 ci012065 p 0003 conclus sarcopenia associ decreas overal surviv rectal cancer patient receiv neoadjuv therapi lower volum muscl mass subcutan fat viscer fat togeth lower albumin protein level higher fib4 score may serv predict marker sarcopenia
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To compare nanocarbon suspension and methylene blue as lymphatic tracers in inguinal lymph node mapping and sorting during surgery for penile cancer. METHODS: This multicentre study included 62 patients (2020-2024); 33 underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and 29 underwent inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND). SLNB patients were divided into control (no tracer), nanocarbon, or methylene blue groups (ChiCTR2200063416). Outcomes included lymph node detection rate (LNDR), number of lymph nodes per side (NOLNPIS), metastasis positive rate (PROLM), and operation time (OT). ILND patients were grouped into nanocarbon-assisted sorting (NLFLNSG) or traditional sorting (TLNSG), with comparisons of NOLNPIS, PROLM, OT, and lymphatic leakage rate (PLLR). RESULTS: Both tracers effectively stained lymph nodes without adverse effects. During SLNB, methylene blue significantly improved LNDR (p = 0.013), NOLNPIS (p = 0.015), and reduced OT (p < 0.0001) compared to control, but PROLM showed no difference. In ILND, NLFLNSG yielded more lymph nodes than TLNSG (p = 0.043), with no significant differences in PROLM, OT, or PLLR. CONCLUSION: Nanocarbon and methylene blue are safe and effective for lymphatic tracing in penile cancer SLNB, improving node identification and surgical efficiency.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent mental health conditions, yet frequently remain undiagnosed. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is one of the most widely used self-report questionnaires for assessing both momentary (state) and general (trait) anxiety severity. As it has also been considered for screening, it is essential to evaluate its accuracy in identifying undiagnosed anxiety disorders. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for detecting anxiety disorders in adults. We specifically aimed to determine accuracy estimates for the full range of sum score cut-offs and grouped our analyses by the STAI's two subscales, State Anxiety subscale (STAI-S) and Trait Anxiety subscale (STAI-T), assessing the target condition category 'any anxiety disorder' (AAD) as well as 'generalised anxiety disorder' (GAD) as one of its specific conditions. SEARCH METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search in Ovid Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed-not-MEDLINE, and PsycINFO (1990 to 15 May 2024). We also screened reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies of adults that administered the STAI irrespective of mode, with no limitations on the language or number of participants. We excluded studies on adults seeking help in mental health settings or participants who were recruited specifically due to mental health symptoms in other settings. Eligible studies administered the STAI as the index test and used a structured or semi-structured diagnostic interview as the reference standard, allowing the creation of 2 x 2 contingency tables. We excluded studies following a case-control design and studies with a time lag of more than four weeks between the STAI and the reference standard. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of articles, extracted data, and evaluated the methodological quality using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool, version 2 (QUADAS-2). We applied the multiple thresholds model to obtain summary sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) across all cut-offs (from >/= 20 to 80). Using the multiple-threshold summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) as an overall measure of accuracy. MAIN RESULTS: We included 12 studies from 11 countries with a total of 2525 participants, of whom 475 had an anxiety disorder. Of these, 11 studies assessed the state anxiety subscale, STAI-S (2042 participants) and eight studies assessed the trait anxiety subscale, STAI-T (1906 participants). The diagnoses made by the reference standards were all ultimately based on criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) administered in seven studies and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID) in five studies. Eleven studies were performed in clinical settings for a variety of specific conditions (e.g. epilepsy, pregnancy), while one study included partners of cancer patients. Most studies showed a high or unclear risk of bias and applicability concerns regarding participant selection. In detecting AAD, summary test accuracy estimates for all cut-offs were obtained from the SROC curves, with an AUC of 0.78 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.82; 11 studies, 2042 participants) for STAI-S and 0.78 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.81; 8 studies, 1906 participants) for STAI-T. At the commonly used cut-offs of >/= 40 for STAI-S, the summary sensitivity was 0.83 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.88) and specificity was 0.55 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.65). Similarly, for STAI-T at the cut-off of >/= 44, the summary sensitivity was 0.81 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.86) and specificity was 0.60 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.74). The analysis of STAI's accuracy in detecting GAD was restricted by the small number of studies (STAI-S: four studies, 1182 participants; STAI-T: three studies, 988 participants). For STAI-S at the cut-off >/= 40, the summary sensitivity was 0.86 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.93) and the specificity was 0.53 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.69). The AUC was 0.80 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.86). For STAI-T at the cut-off >/= 44, sensitivity was 0.86 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.94) and specificity 0.57 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.75). The AUC was 0.81 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.82). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The currently available evidence does not allow a confident judgment on the STAI's accuracy in screening for anxiety disorders. Findings come from a limited number of studies, most at high or unclear risk of bias, and almost exclusively conducted in specialised clinical settings among individuals with a variety of underlying health conditions, thus limiting generalisability. Based on common interpretations of the AUC, the overall accuracy of the STAI-S and STAI-T subscales across all cut-offs is moderate and broadly comparable to other anxiety questionnaires. While proposed cut-offs (>/= 40 for STAI-S and >/= 44 for STAI-T) provide adequate sensitivity, specificity remains low, thus raising concerns about substantial misclassification, particularly in low-prevalence contexts. Its suitability for screening is further limited by its original purpose as a severity measure, its considerable length compared to alternative questionnaires, its two separate subscale scores without clear screening guidance, and the absence of evidence-based cut-off recommendations. Thus, the STAI currently does not appear to be the first-choice screening instrument, particularly given the availability of shorter, better-researched questionnaires that have been specifically developed for anxiety screening. However, given the limited evidence base and the lack of formal comparisons with other questionnaires, this conclusion remains preliminary.

cancer,"Autophagy-mediated targeted protein degradation, exemplified by technologies such as autophagosome-tethering compounds (ATTECs), AUTOphagy-TArgeting chimeras (AUTOTACs), and autophagy-targeting chimeras (AUTACs), leverages the autophagy-lysosome pathway for the clearance of challenging substrates that often exceed proteasomal capacity. These substrates include large protein aggregates, multi-protein complexes, and even entire organelles. This review synthesizes key advances in the development of autophagy-based degraders since 2022, highlighting their therapeutic potential through exemplar applications. We discuss their utility in oncology, neurodegenerative disorders, and inflammatory/cardiometabolic diseases. These novel modalities have demonstrated potent, selective, and durable substrate elimination in vivo, successfully overcoming resistance mechanisms associated with traditional occupancy-driven inhibition. Finally, we summarize the general workflow for developing autophagy-based degraders, outline the current challenges and future directions in this field, and aim to promote fundamental mechanistic studies and innovative medicinal chemistry research, thereby accelerating the clinical translation of autophagy-targeting degraders for the treatment of various human diseases.",autophagymedi target protein degrad exemplifi technolog autophagosometeth compound attec autophagytarget chimera autotac autophagytarget chimera autac leverag autophagylysosom pathway clearanc challeng substrat often exceed proteasom capac substrat includ larg protein aggreg multiprotein complex even entir organel review synthes key advanc develop autophagybas degrad sinc 2022 highlight therapeut potenti exemplar applic discuss util oncolog neurodegen disord inflammatorycardiometabol diseas novel modal demonstr potent select durabl substrat elimin vivo success overcom resist mechan associ tradit occupancydriven inhibit final summar gener workflow develop autophagybas degrad outlin current challeng futur direct field aim promot fundament mechanist studi innov medicin chemistri research therebi acceler clinic translat autophagytarget degrad treatment variou human diseas
cancer,"Nanometal-based therapies face challenges arising from the overexpression of proton efflux transporters in cancer cells, which acidifies the extracellular tumor microenvironment (TME) while preserving a relatively neutral intracellular pH, thereby compromising therapeutic efficacy and fostering an immunosuppressive TME. Here, we integrate the proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole (PTZ) with manganese ferrite nanoparticles (MFNs) within an acidity-responsive polymer for enhanced ferroptosis and cGAS-STING activation mediated immunotherapy. This assembly (PTZ/MFNAs) facilitates tumor accumulation through the enhanced permeability and retention effect while initially restricting the release of metal ions. Upon reaching the tumor site, PTZ release increases intracellular acidity, which further triggers assembly disintegration, accelerates the release of iron and manganese ions, and neutralizes the extracellular microenvironment to alleviate immunosuppression. The released manganese ions synergistically collaborate with iron ions to amplify reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation for ferroptosis while activating the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway, stimulating innate immunity. This potentiation of innate immunity, coupled with the reversal of TME immunosuppression, collectively and effectively inhibits tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore, the PTZ/MFNAs co-delivery system represents a promising pH-modulation strategy to enhance iron/manganese ions-mediated ferroptosis and cGAS-STING activation-induced immunotherapy.",nanometalbas therapi face challeng aris overexpress proton efflux transport cancer cell acidifi extracellular tumor microenviron tme preserv rel neutral intracellular ph therebi compromis therapeut efficaci foster immunosuppress tme integr proton pump inhibitor pantoprazol ptz manganes ferrit nanoparticl mfn within acidityrespons polym enhanc ferroptosi cgasst activ mediat immunotherapi assembl ptzmfna facilit tumor accumul enhanc permeabl retent effect initi restrict releas metal ion upon reach tumor site ptz releas increas intracellular acid trigger assembl disintegr acceler releas iron manganes ion neutral extracellular microenviron allevi immunosuppress releas manganes ion synergist collabor iron ion amplifi reactiv oxygen speci ro gener ferroptosi activ cyclic guanosin monophosphateadenosin monophosph synthasestimul interferon gene cgasst pathway stimul innat immun potenti innat immun coupl revers tme immunosuppress collect effect inhibit tumor growth metastasi therefor ptzmfna codeliveri system repres promis phmodul strategi enhanc ironmanganes ionsmedi ferroptosi cgasst activationinduc immunotherapi
cancer,"Cervical cancer screening is a life-saving endeavour. The introduction of an organized population-based national screening programmes has potential to both reduce incidence of cervical cancer in an asymptomatic population and detect early-stage cancers for accelerated treatment. A methodology for estimating cancers prevented by such programmes has immediate utility. This work derives a model for estimating cancer prevented by screening, applied to data from Ireland's organized national cervical screening programme since its introduction in August 2008 to August 2022. A novel Markov-chain model for human papilloma virus (HPV) induced cervical cancer was derived with realistic transition probabilities validated against literature estimates. Data from the Irish National Screening Programme (CervicalCheck) and from the National Cancer Registry of Ireland (NCRI) was applied to estimate the number of cancers prevented by screening, changes in Irish cancer detection since the implementation of screening, and treatment costs saved by screening. Since its inception in 2008, the modelling in this work suggests that CervicalCheck has prevented an estimated 5557 cancers (95% confidence interval: 5114-6000 cancers) and saved euro102 million in future treatment costs (95% confidence interval: euro94-110 million) not including inflation costs. Additionally, 48.8% (95% confidence interval: 41.4%-56.2%) of all cervical cancers in Ireland have been detected through screening between 2008 and 2022. National screening in Ireland has been highly effective at reducing future cervical cancers, and detecting asymptomatic cancers. The model outlined here has direct future applicability for the assessment of national and regional cervical cancer screening programmes.",cervic cancer screen lifesav endeavour introduct organ populationbas nation screen programm potenti reduc incid cervic cancer asymptomat popul detect earlystag cancer acceler treatment methodolog estim cancer prevent programm immedi util work deriv model estim cancer prevent screen appli data ireland organ nation cervic screen programm sinc introduct august 2008 august 2022 novel markovchain model human papilloma viru hpv induc cervic cancer deriv realist transit probabl valid literatur estim data irish nation screen programm cervicalcheck nation cancer registri ireland ncri appli estim number cancer prevent screen chang irish cancer detect sinc implement screen treatment cost save screen sinc incept 2008 model work suggest cervicalcheck prevent estim 5557 cancer 95 confid interv 51146000 cancer save euro102 million futur treatment cost 95 confid interv euro94110 million includ inflat cost addit 488 95 confid interv 414562 cervic cancer ireland detect screen 2008 2022 nation screen ireland highli effect reduc futur cervic cancer detect asymptomat cancer model outlin direct futur applic assess nation region cervic cancer screen programm
cancer,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the predominant type of primary liver cancer, with high morbidity and mortality rates globally, ranking it among the leading causes of cancer‑related death worldwide. Despite notable advancements in HCC treatment in recent years, high rates of recurrence and treatment resistance remain significant clinical challenges. The development of drug resistance undermines the efficacy of current therapies and leads to poor patient outcomes. However, the specific role and detailed delivery mechanism of exosomal circular RNAs (circRNAs) in mediating this treatment resistance are still largely undefined. circRNAs represent a group of non‑coding RNAs with various biological roles. An increasing number of circRNAs are abnormally expressed in HCC and participate in the malignant progression of HCC, playing a role in HCC treatment resistance. Furthermore, circRNAs can exert additional effects when packaged into exosomes. Exosomes, as signaling molecules of intercellular communication, are enriched with circRNAs, which can be packaged, secreted and transferred to target recipient tumor cells, thereby regulating the development process and drug resistance of cancer. The present comprehensive review aims to summarize how these exosomal circRNAs regulate key hallmarks of cancer in HCC and critically synthesize the current literature, elucidating how exosomal circRNAs modulate therapeutic resistance in HCC and highlighting their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",hepatocellular carcinoma hcc predomin type primari liver cancer high morbid mortal rate global rank among lead caus cancer‑rel death worldwid despit notabl advanc hcc treatment recent year high rate recurr treatment resist remain signific clinic challeng develop drug resist undermin efficaci current therapi lead poor patient outcom howev specif role detail deliveri mechan exosom circular rna circrna mediat treatment resist still larg undefin circrna repres group non‑cod rna variou biolog role increas number circrna abnorm express hcc particip malign progress hcc play role hcc treatment resist furthermor circrna exert addit effect packag exosom exosom signal molecul intercellular commun enrich circrna packag secret transfer target recipi tumor cell therebi regul develop process drug resist cancer present comprehens review aim summar exosom circrna regul key hallmark cancer hcc critic synthes current literatur elucid exosom circrna modul therapeut resist hcc highlight potenti biomark therapeut target
cancer,"Pain serves as both a protective physiological response essential for species survival and a global health issue affecting human well‑being and societal development. The present review systematically summarized and analyzed the research progresses on pain through a multidimensional analytical framework encompassing animal models, molecular targets, therapeutic approaches and future prospects. In animal modeling, neuropathic pain paradigms have evolved from traditional mechanical compression to composite models that combine dynamic displacement and chemical stimulation. Cancer‑induced pain models employ orthotopic tumor transplantation to recapitulate bone metastasis and soft tissue invasion mechanisms and visceral pain models combine inflammatory mediators with mechanical distension to replicate clinical manifestations. The above animal models are the main models of pain, each with its own characteristics and applicable scope. The studies of molecular targets have identified voltage‑gated ion channel, G protein‑coupled receptor signaling cascades, and inflammation‑related enzymes as critical analgesic targets, providing a molecular basis for the design of new analgesic drugs. New targets for treating pain are still being studied. Clinical treatment strategies are showing a trend of multimodal integration, with breakthroughs in opioid optimization and non‑opioid innovation in drug therapy, precise analgesia achieved through neuromodulation techniques in intervention therapy, and strengthened chronic pain management dimensions through physical and psychological interventions. Although there are a number of means for treating pain, the research on drugs that can truly cure pain has still a long way to go. The future research and development of analgesics will focus on in‑depth analysis of pathological mechanisms, adverse reactions of opioid drugs, personalized analgesic strategies, and interdisciplinary transformation.",pain serv protect physiolog respons essenti speci surviv global health issu affect human well‑b societ develop present review systemat summar analyz research progress pain multidimension analyt framework encompass anim model molecular target therapeut approach futur prospect anim model neuropath pain paradigm evolv tradit mechan compress composit model combin dynam displac chemic stimul cancer‑induc pain model employ orthotop tumor transplant recapitul bone metastasi soft tissu invas mechan viscer pain model combin inflammatori mediat mechan distens replic clinic manifest anim model main model pain characterist applic scope studi molecular target identifi voltage‑g ion channel g protein‑coupl receptor signal cascad inflammation‑rel enzym critic analges target provid molecular basi design new analges drug new target treat pain still studi clinic treatment strategi show trend multimod integr breakthrough opioid optim non‑opioid innov drug therapi precis analgesia achiev neuromodul techniqu intervent therapi strengthen chronic pain manag dimens physic psycholog intervent although number mean treat pain research drug truli cure pain still long way go futur research develop analges focu in‑depth analysi patholog mechan advers reaction opioid drug person analges strategi interdisciplinari transform
cancer,"Following the publication of the above paper, it was drawn to the Editor's attention by a concerned reader that the '50 microg/ml ELE' and '100 microg/ml ELE' data panels shown in Fig. 6A were apparently identical, suggesting that the same data panel had been inserted twice into this figure to show the results from differently performed experiments. Moreover, data featured in the microscopic images in Fig. 2 overlapped with images in a paper that had been published by the same research group in 2013 in the journal PLoS One, where the treatment represented was different (treatment with TGF‑beta1). Upon performing an independent analysis of the data in the Editorial Office, it also came to light that one of the same microscopic images was strikingly similar to a data panel featured in Fig. 4 in another article written by different authors at different research institutes that was published subsequently in the journal Scientific Reports, albeit the image was featured in colour in that publication, whereas it had appeared in greyscale in the above paper.

cancer,"Cancer remains a major global health challenge, with approximately 18 million new cases reported annually. Existing evidence highlights the PAK1 protein as a critical regulator of cancer progression, making it a promising therapeutic target. The PAK1 protein complexed with dibenzodiazepine was fetched from the PDB with the identifier 4ZLO. The structure was preprocessed through preparation and exposed to pharmacophore hypotheses on the Schrodinger suite programme, indicating key features of RRH. A multi-tiered docking-based screening workflow from the libraries of ZINC and Enamine databases identified five potential bioactive compounds: ZINC952869440, ZINC952869442, ENAMINE558, ENAMINE6304, and ENAMINE8429. The docking and MM/GBSA scores ranked from -5.02 to -8.34 kcal/mol and -46.10 to -50.41 kcal/mol. Remarkably, none of these candidates violated the rules of five, and the Qikprop parameters complied with pharmacokinetic suitability. The DFT analysis revealed energy gap scores ranged from -0.182 to -0.225 eV, indicating favourable electronic properties and stability of the ligands. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) and essential dynamics (ED) studies validated the structural stability of the complexes. The secondary structure analysis indicated stable retention of alpha-helices and beta-strands throughout the simulation.

Bioinformatics analysis, cellular experiments and animal models investigated the functions of CCDC137 in RNA post‑transcriptional regulation, epigenetic modification and the tumor microenvironment. The results showed that CCDC137 can bind specific mRNAs to affect physiological processes such as the cell cycle, participate in epigenetic regulation such as DNA methylation and histone modification and influence tumor immune escape by affecting the functions of tumor‑associated macrophages.

cancer,"Krebs von den Lungen‑6 (KL‑6), a high‑molecular‑weight glycoprotein, is frequently elevated in patients with cancer; however, its precise role in the clinical progression of breast cancer (BC) remains unclear. Tumor hypoxia has been recognized as a critical driver of cancer progression. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of hypoxia on KL‑6 expression and its contribution to the invasive behavior of BC cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of KL‑6 and hypoxia‑inducible factor‑1alpha (HIF‑1alpha) was performed in 30 clinical BC tissue samples, and their expression levels were correlated with patient outcomes. BC cell lines (MCF‑7 and MDA‑MB‑231) were used for in vitro analyses, including immunofluorescence, western blotting, wound healing assays, and three‑dimensional spheroid cultures under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, as well as chemically induced hypoxia using cobalt chloride (CoCl(2)). The subcellular localization of KL‑6 was further examined through immunoelectron microscopy. In clinical specimens, high KL‑6 expression was significantly associated with increased recurrence or metastasis, as was elevated HIF‑1alpha expression. Although MCF‑7 cells exhibited higher basal KL‑6 expression, marked upregulation was observed in MDA‑MB‑231 cells under hypoxic spheroid conditions, where KL‑6 co‑localized with HIF‑1alpha, particularly within invasive cellular protrusions. Functional inhibition of KL‑6 suppressed the migration of MCF‑7 cells. Treatment with CoCl(2) significantly induced KL‑6 and HIF‑1alpha expression in MCF‑7 cells. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed the localization of KL‑6 on cell membranes and within protrusive structures. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that hypoxia enhances KL‑6 expression in BC cells, partly mediated by HIF‑1alpha, and that KL‑6 contributes to tumor cell invasion.",kreb von den lungen‑6 kl‑6 high‑molecular‑weight glycoprotein frequent elev patient cancer howev precis role clinic progress breast cancer bc remain unclear tumor hypoxia recogn critic driver cancer progress present studi aim investig effect hypoxia kl‑6 express contribut invas behavior bc cell immunohistochem analysi kl‑6 hypoxia‑induc factor‑1alpha hif‑1alpha perform 30 clinic bc tissu sampl express level correl patient outcom bc cell line mcf‑7 mda‑mb‑231 use vitro analys includ immunofluoresc western blot wound heal assay three‑dimension spheroid cultur normox hypox condit well chemic induc hypoxia use cobalt chlorid cocl2 subcellular local kl‑6 examin immunoelectron microscopi clinic specimen high kl‑6 express significantli associ increas recurr metastasi elev hif‑1alpha express although mcf‑7 cell exhibit higher basal kl‑6 express mark upregul observ mda‑mb‑231 cell hypox spheroid condit kl‑6 co‑loc hif‑1alpha particularli within invas cellular protrus function inhibit kl‑6 suppress migrat mcf‑7 cell treatment cocl2 significantli induc kl‑6 hif‑1alpha express mcf‑7 cell ultrastructur analysi confirm local kl‑6 cell membran within protrus structur collect find demonstr hypoxia enhanc kl‑6 express bc cell partli mediat hif‑1alpha kl‑6 contribut tumor cell invas
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common skin cancer worldwide, accounting for approximately 80% of all skin cancers. Although more prevalent among Caucasians, BCC affects individuals of all racial and ethnic groups and may present atypically in skin of color, contributing to delayed diagnosis. AIMS: This review aims to examine the causes, clinical presentations, prevention strategies, and treatment options for BCC, with an emphasis on recent advancements and ongoing challenges in management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review integrates current peer-reviewed literature with clinical insights derived from dermatologic practice, including the evaluation of representative, deidentified patient cases. Observations from clinical experience were incorporated to contextualize diagnostic approaches, management strategies, and treatment outcomes across diverse patient populations. All patient information was anonymized, and no identifiable data were included. RESULTS: Ultraviolet (UV) radiation remains the leading cause of BCC in fair-skinned populations, whereas genetic predispositions and environmental factors play a larger role in darker-skinned individuals. Diagnostic advances, including dermoscopy and reflectance confocal microscopy, have improved detection, particularly for pigmented lesions that may mimic benign conditions. Preventative strategies include broad-spectrum physical sunscreens, protective clothing, lifestyle modifications, and supplementation such as nicotinamide, which has demonstrated potential in reducing UV-induced skin damage. Treatment options range from Mohs micrographic surgery, considered the gold standard for high-risk and cosmetically sensitive areas, to simple excision, electrodessication and curettage, radiation therapy, and advanced systemic therapies including sonic hedgehog and PD-1 inhibitors for locally advanced or metastatic disease. DISCUSSION: Emerging diagnostic tools and expanding therapeutic modalities have enhanced the ability to tailor BCC management to individual patient risk profiles and tumor characteristics. Non-surgical and combination approaches continue to evolve, offering effective alternatives for select cases.

OBJECTIVES: To analyse temporal trends in candidemia among patients with solid tumours and haematological malignancies admitted to a dedicated cancer centre. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all episodes of candidemia from July 2008 to June 2020 (12-year period). The incidence of candidemia was estimated as the number of new cases per 1000 patient days of hospital admission quarterly. A linear regression model was used to analyse changes in incidence rates. RESULTS: Over a 12-year period a total of 212 episodes of candidemia were identified with 90 (42.5%) occurring in patients with haematological malignancies and 122 (57.5%) in patients with solid tumours. The overall incidence of candidemia was 0.49 episodes per 1000 patient-days of admission per quarter. There was a significant decline in the incidence of candidemia overtime for the overall cohort (from 0.81 to 0.21 patient days per quarter, p < 0.001). This decline was statistically significant in patients with solid tumours (from 0.91 to 0.18 patient days per quarter, p < 0.001) with only a downward trend noted in patients with haematological malignancies (from 0.65 to 0.25 patient days per quarter, p = 0.052). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a global decline in episodes of candidemia in patients with malignancies mainly driven by a decrease in patients with solid tumours.

cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the practicability of self-collected tampons with the MPap assay for endometrial cancer (EC) detection, by comparing with the results of cervical swabs. METHODS: A total of 85 women at Tri-Service General Hospital (TSGH) were included to directly compare the performance of physician-collected swabs and self-collected tampons. An additional cohort of 39 self-collected tampons from patients at Shuang Ho Hospital (SHH) was included for further validation. The effects of age, body mass index (BMI), and BHLHE22 and CDO1 methylation levels on MPap test performance were analyzed across samples from patients with and without EC. The performance of the MPap test is presented as percentage of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy (ACC). The Pearson's correlation test was used to examine the association between swab and tampon in the MPap test. RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) of MPap to detect EC in 85 swabs and tampons both were 0.94 (0.88-1.00). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and ACC of the two collection methods did not show significant differences. The testing results using a tampon were highly correlated with the results using a physician-collected swab (R(2) = 0.6810, P < 0.001). Furthermore, the AUC of MPap to detect EC in 39 tampons was 0.97 (0.93-1.02). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and ACC were 90.48%, 94.44%, 95.00%, 89.47%, and 92.31%, respectively.

cancer,"Cell division cycle 20 homologue (Cdc20), a key regulator of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), is frequently overexpressed in human cancers and represents a promising therapeutic target. However, monotherapy targeting Cdc20 has shown limited efficacy, partly due to compensatory activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1). In this study, we investigated the combinatorial potential of the pan-Cdk inhibitor ZK304709 with the Cdc20 inhibitor apcin in HeLa cervical cancer cells. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that both CDC20 and CDK1 are upregulated in cervical cancer tissues. Mechanistically, apcin treatment induced cyclin B1 accumulation and enhanced Cdk1 phosphorylation at Thr161, suggesting feedback activation. In contrast, ZK304709 reduced p-Cdk1(T161) levels and suppressed Cdc20 expression at both protein and mRNA levels. Functionally, the combination of apcin and ZK304709 synergistically inhibited cell proliferation and induced G2/M phase arrest in HeLa cells. These findings demonstrate that dual inhibition of Cdk1 and Cdc20 disrupts compensatory signalling pathways and enhances antitumour efficacy in HeLa cells, providing a rational strategy for combination therapy in cervical cancer.",cell divis cycl 20 homologu cdc20 key regul anaphasepromot complexcyclosom apcc frequent overexpress human cancer repres promis therapeut target howev monotherapi target cdc20 shown limit efficaci partli due compensatori activ cyclindepend kinas 1 cdk1 studi investig combinatori potenti pancdk inhibitor zk304709 cdc20 inhibitor apcin hela cervic cancer cell transcriptom analysi reveal cdc20 cdk1 upregul cervic cancer tissu mechanist apcin treatment induc cyclin b1 accumul enhanc cdk1 phosphoryl thr161 suggest feedback activ contrast zk304709 reduc pcdk1t161 level suppress cdc20 express protein mrna level function combin apcin zk304709 synergist inhibit cell prolifer induc g2m phase arrest hela cell find demonstr dual inhibit cdk1 cdc20 disrupt compensatori signal pathway enhanc antitumour efficaci hela cell provid ration strategi combin therapi cervic cancer
cancer,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is among the ten most common cancers worldwide and is associated with high morbidity and poor survival. Diminished HNSCC outcomes are often related to delayed diagnosis and treatment of occult progression of premalignant lesions, underscoring the need for effective and low risk chemoprevention strategies. In this regard, metformin has shown promising clinical activity for HNSCC prevention. Here, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen of metformin-treated HNSCC cells and identified activation of PKA signaling as the top resistance pathway. We show that metformin mediates PKA activation in HNSCC cells, and that PKA inhibition (PKAi) when combined with metformin treatment synergistically inhibits HNSCC growth. We found that metformin-induced PKA activation is mediated by a prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) autocrine loop, which can be blocked using cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) inhibitors. Importantly, COX2 inhibition using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) combined with metformin treatment synergistically inhibits HNSCC cell growth and prevents progression of oral premalignant lesions (OPLs) into invasive HNSCC in a model of tobacco-driven oral carcinogenesis. Together, these findings demonstrate that metformin and NSAID combination therapy may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for HNSCC chemoprevention.",head neck squamou cell carcinoma hnscc among ten common cancer worldwid associ high morbid poor surviv diminish hnscc outcom often relat delay diagnosi treatment occult progress premalign lesion underscor need effect low risk chemoprevent strategi regard metformin shown promis clinic activ hnscc prevent perform genomewid crisprcas9 screen metformintr hnscc cell identifi activ pka signal top resist pathway show metformin mediat pka activ hnscc cell pka inhibit pkai combin metformin treatment synergist inhibit hnscc growth found metformininduc pka activ mediat prostaglandin e2 pge2 autocrin loop block use cyclooxygenase2 cox2 inhibitor importantli cox2 inhibit use nonsteroid antiinflammatori drug nsaid combin metformin treatment synergist inhibit hnscc cell growth prevent progress oral premalign lesion opl invas hnscc model tobaccodriven oral carcinogenesi togeth find demonstr metformin nsaid combin therapi may repres promis therapeut strategi hnscc chemoprevent
cancer,"Paraspeckles are stress-induced nuclear RNA-protein condensates that assemble on the long non-coding RNA NEAT1. Their increased formation under certain cellular circumstances has gained growing interest due to their association with serious human diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. The biological functions of paraspeckles still appear obscure, but increasing evidence suggests that they contribute to regulation of gene expression by recruiting specific proteins and RNA molecules. Here, we have characterized and compared two stress-enriched interactomes of the essential paraspeckle protein NONO in both wild type and paraspeckle-deficient NEAT1 knockout cells. We identified Hsp70 as part of stress-enriched NONO complexes in wild type, but not in NEAT1-depleted cells. We show that proteotoxic stress-induced paraspeckle formation and NEAT1 expression are strictly dependent on Hsp70 chaperone activity. Our data demonstrate that both NONO and Hsp70 transiently translocate to the nucleolus during heat shock and that paraspeckle formation during recovery follows Hsp70-dependent relocation of NONO from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. Taken together, we demonstrate an important role of Hsp70 in paraspeckle assembly and identify a possible link between the nuclear protein quality control system and paraspeckles.",paraspeckl stressinduc nuclear rnaprotein condens assembl long noncod rna neat1 increas format certain cellular circumst gain grow interest due associ seriou human diseas neurodegen disord cancer biolog function paraspeckl still appear obscur increas evid suggest contribut regul gene express recruit specif protein rna molecul character compar two stressenrich interactom essenti paraspeckl protein nono wild type paraspeckledefici neat1 knockout cell identifi hsp70 part stressenrich nono complex wild type neat1deplet cell show proteotox stressinduc paraspeckl format neat1 express strictli depend hsp70 chaperon activ data demonstr nono hsp70 transient transloc nucleolu heat shock paraspeckl format recoveri follow hsp70depend reloc nono nucleolu nucleoplasm taken togeth demonstr import role hsp70 paraspeckl assembl identifi possibl link nuclear protein qualiti control system paraspeckl
cancer,"BACKGROUND: In February 2024, a sudden government policy to drastically increase medical school admissions triggered the mass resignations of medical trainees across South Korea, severely disrupting hospital operations. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the resulting healthcare workforce disruptions on short-term clinical outcomes and the timing of colorectal cancer surgeries. METHODS: This retrospective comparative study analyzed patients with colorectal cancer treated at two national university hospitals in Daegu and Gwangju, South Korea. Patients who first visited the colorectal surgery department between March and August of 2023 and 2024 were included. Data from 2020 to 2022 were used for extended comparisons. The primary outcome was the interval from initial outpatient visit to surgery. Secondary outcomes included treatment modality distribution, tumor staging, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: A total of 895 patients in 2023 and 853 in 2024 were included. In 2024, only 39.5% of patients (337/853) underwent upfront surgery compared to 63.5% (569/895) in 2023. The median time to surgery increased from 30 days (interquartile range [IQR], 22-44 days) to 52 days (IQR, 30-72 days) (p=0.001). Clinical T3-4 tumors increased from 49.9% to 59.3% (p=0.018), lymph node-positive cases increased from 25.9% to 51.3% (p=0.001), and postoperative complication rates increased from 12.0% to 28.2% (p=0.001). CONCLUSION: The abrupt healthcare workforce crisis in early 2024 significantly delayed colorectal cancer surgeries and was associated with worse short-term oncologic outcomes. These findings highlight the critical importance of maintaining a stable healthcare workforce to protect access to timely cancer care.",background februari 2024 sudden govern polici drastic increas medic school admiss trigger mass resign medic traine across south korea sever disrupt hospit oper studi aim evalu impact result healthcar workforc disrupt shortterm clinic outcom time colorect cancer surgeri method retrospect compar studi analyz patient colorect cancer treat two nation univers hospit daegu gwangju south korea patient first visit colorect surgeri depart march august 2023 2024 includ data 2020 2022 use extend comparison primari outcom interv initi outpati visit surgeri secondari outcom includ treatment modal distribut tumor stage postop complic result total 895 patient 2023 853 2024 includ 2024 395 patient 337853 underw upfront surgeri compar 635 569895 2023 median time surgeri increas 30 day interquartil rang iqr 2244 day 52 day iqr 3072 day p0001 clinic t34 tumor increas 499 593 p0018 lymph nodeposit case increas 259 513 p0001 postop complic rate increas 120 282 p0001 conclus abrupt healthcar workforc crisi earli 2024 significantli delay colorect cancer surgeri associ wors shortterm oncolog outcom find highlight critic import maintain stabl healthcar workforc protect access time cancer care
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are a group of drugs used to cease the production of estrogens that have been used to treat mainly postmenopausal women with both early and advanced estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer for more than 40 years. They are the first-line therapy for hormone-dependent cancers either alone or in combination with other therapies. This review aims to demonstrate the relevance of research on steroidal AIs. AREAS COVERED: This work focuses on steroidal AIs and aims to provide a comprehensive explanation of the most potent ones (IC(50) < 10 microM), the respective structure-activity relationships (SAR), and the particular biological mechanisms of action, published during the last 20 years, from 2005 until June 2025. The literature search was made on the web of science database, using the topic 'steroidal aromatase inhibitors.' EXPERT OPINION: Potent hit steroidal AIs have been discovered. However, further studies are needed, including tests on more complex models, namely using 3D cell lines and organoids as well as animal studies, with the aim of progressing on the drug discovery process, ultimately to discover new potent steroidal AIs with less side effects, especially those related to bone and cardiovascular health and capable to overcome endocrine resistance.",introduct aromatas inhibitor ai group drug use ceas product estrogen use treat mainli postmenopaus women earli advanc estrogen receptor posit er breast cancer 40 year firstlin therapi hormonedepend cancer either alon combin therapi review aim demonstr relev research steroid ai area cover work focus steroid ai aim provid comprehens explan potent one ic50 10 microm respect structureact relationship sar particular biolog mechan action publish last 20 year 2005 june 2025 literatur search made web scienc databas use topic steroid aromatas inhibitor expert opinion potent hit steroid ai discov howev studi need includ test complex model name use 3d cell line organoid well anim studi aim progress drug discoveri process ultim discov new potent steroid ai less side effect especi relat bone cardiovascular health capabl overcom endocrin resist
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing incidence of cancer worldwide, the knowledge about the trend of cancer incidence in Ethiopia is limited. The paucity of core cancer diagnostic services like pathology, diagnostic imaging technology, and the absence of a comprehensive national cancer registry masked the exact magnitude of cancer incidence in Ethiopia in general and the Wolaita area in particular. This study is aimed at filling the gap by analyzing diagnostic data from a referral clinic. The clinic used to serve as a primary diagnostic center for patients referred from over 25 healthcare facilities in the region. METHODS: A pathology sample retrospective analysis-based prevalence study was conducted for the period between December 2017 and February 2022. Records saved in computers were subjected to analysis by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software Version 22. The data were used to analyze the types and distribution of cancers in the region across age, sex, and diagnosis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS: The results showed notable gender disparities, with women experiencing a greater prevalence of breast cancer and men mostly receiving diagnoses for soft tissue sarcomas. The most prevalent forms of cancer were determined, along with the locations of each. The study also emphasized how different referral facilities, such as general hospitals, primary hospitals, and medium-sized clinics, had varying cancer incidence rates. Although generalizability may be limited by the study's clinic-based design, its relevance to comparable healthcare settings in Ethiopia and other low-resource locations is strengthened by the large and diverse sample drawn from a variety of referral institutions. This study emphasizes the necessity of focused screening programs and greater cancer awareness in Wolaita Zone, particularly in rural regions. The results also suggest possible directions for future investigation, such as population-based studies to confirm and build upon these findings. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides crucial insights into the cancer burden in Wolaita Zone and emphasizes the importance of improving diagnostic and preventive measures. Further research, including broader, population-based studies, is necessary to confirm these findings and inform regional cancer control strategies.",background despit increas incid cancer worldwid knowledg trend cancer incid ethiopia limit pauciti core cancer diagnost servic like patholog diagnost imag technolog absenc comprehens nation cancer registri mask exact magnitud cancer incid ethiopia gener wolaita area particular studi aim fill gap analyz diagnost data referr clinic clinic use serv primari diagnost center patient refer 25 healthcar facil region method patholog sampl retrospect analysisbas preval studi conduct period decemb 2017 februari 2022 record save comput subject analysi use statist packag social scienc spss softwar version 22 data use analyz type distribut cancer region across age sex diagnosi result discuss result show notabl gender dispar women experienc greater preval breast cancer men mostli receiv diagnos soft tissu sarcoma preval form cancer determin along locat studi also emphas differ referr facil gener hospit primari hospit mediums clinic vari cancer incid rate although generaliz may limit studi clinicbas design relev compar healthcar set ethiopia lowresourc locat strengthen larg divers sampl drawn varieti referr institut studi emphas necess focus screen program greater cancer awar wolaita zone particularli rural region result also suggest possibl direct futur investig populationbas studi confirm build upon find conclus studi provid crucial insight cancer burden wolaita zone emphas import improv diagnost prevent measur research includ broader populationbas studi necessari confirm find inform region cancer control strategi
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) affects up to 20% of cancer patients, causing dyspnea and frequent hospitalizations. Treatment includes thoracentesis, pleurodesis, and indwelling pleural catheters (IPC). While UK pleural clinics enhance outpatient care, Denmark lacks a national strategy. This study aims to map the use of IPCs in a Nordic country, focusing on referral, placement, follow-up, and reimbursement of expenses to drainage supplies. METHODS: A national questionnaire survey was conducted from January to July 2022. The questionnaire, developed by the Danish Respiratory Society's pleural diseases group, covered IPC placement, management, follow-up, and financial aspects. It was distributed to all departments placing IPCs, identified via suppliers and expert input. Data on the number of IPCs delivered to each department in 2022 were obtained from Danish IPC retailers. RESULTS: Of the 23 identified departments, 20 completed the survey. IPCs were available in all five Danish healthcare regions, but heterogeneity was observed in prevalence, reimbursement methods, procedural organization, and follow-up strategies. IPC use was more prevalent in respiratory medical departments and in the North and Central Regions. No standardized national reimbursement policy was identified. CONCLUSION: This survey reveals regional disparities in IPC use and reimbursement in Denmark within the same public healthcare system. The lack of national guidelines and centralized funding mechanisms may contribute to these variations. The introduction of dedicated pleural clinics and standardized reimbursement policies could help ensure equitable and guideline-based MPE management across regions.",background malign pleural effus mpe affect 20 cancer patient caus dyspnea frequent hospit treatment includ thoracentesi pleurodesi indwel pleural cathet ipc uk pleural clinic enhanc outpati care denmark lack nation strategi studi aim map use ipc nordic countri focus referr placement followup reimburs expens drainag suppli method nation questionnair survey conduct januari juli 2022 questionnair develop danish respiratori societi pleural diseas group cover ipc placement manag followup financi aspect distribut depart place ipc identifi via supplier expert input data number ipc deliv depart 2022 obtain danish ipc retail result 23 identifi depart 20 complet survey ipc avail five danish healthcar region heterogen observ preval reimburs method procedur organ followup strategi ipc use preval respiratori medic depart north central region standard nation reimburs polici identifi conclus survey reveal region dispar ipc use reimburs denmark within public healthcar system lack nation guidelin central fund mechan may contribut variat introduct dedic pleural clinic standard reimburs polici could help ensur equit guidelinebas mpe manag across region
cancer,"Background Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with significant variation in clinical behaviour, pathological morphology and molecular patterns. While most of the breast cancer cases follow common histological and clinical patterns, but a few rare subtypes behave differently with a difference in prognosis and response to therapy. Recognizing these subtypes of breast cancer is important for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Aims and objectives This study aimed to evaluate the clinical features, pathological criteria, and outcomes of patients with these rare breast cancer subtypes treated at King Fahad Specialist Hospital (KFSH-D), a biggest regional tertiary care center.  Patients and methods This is a retrospective, observational, descriptive study analyzing 30 patients diagnosed with rare breast cancer subtypes and treated at KFSH-D between January 2019 and December 2024. Results We included 30 patients with rare pathological breast cancer subtypes. Among them, eight patients (27%) had apocrine carcinoma. The mean age at diagnosis for this group was between 55 and 60 years and a mean tumor size was greater than 2 cm. Additionally, 14 (46%) patients had metaplastic carcinoma, with a mean age at diagnosis of 45-60 years and tumor sizes ranging between 3 and 5 cm. Five (17%) patients were diagnosed with mucinous adenocarcinoma. Their mean age at diagnosis was 70 years, with tumors larger than 2 cm. All of these patients had stage N0-N1 disease and were positive for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and negative for Her-2/neu on immunohistochemistry (IHC). One (3%) patient had lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma. She was diagnosed at 51 years of age, with a tumor size of 2.2x3.2 cm. She underwent simple mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The tumor was histologic grade III with no lymphovascular invasion or intraductal component. We also identified two (7%) patients with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) showing neuroendocrine differentiation. Both were positive for chromogranin A and synaptophysin on IHC. Their ages at diagnosis were 55-65 years, and tumor sizes ranged from 4 to 6 cm. These tumors were histologic grade III, hormone receptor-positive, and Her-2/neu negative. Survival outcomes varied across groups, with mucinous carcinoma showing the most favorable prognosis. Conclusion Rare subtypes of invasive breast cancers have distinct clinical and pathological behaviours with different outcomes. Recognition of these tumors will help in patient-tailored treatment strategies and will contribute to better patient management.",background breast cancer heterogen diseas signific variat clinic behaviour patholog morpholog molecular pattern breast cancer case follow common histolog clinic pattern rare subtyp behav differ differ prognosi respons therapi recogn subtyp breast cancer import accur diagnosi treatment plan aim object studi aim evalu clinic featur patholog criteria outcom patient rare breast cancer subtyp treat king fahad specialist hospit kfshd biggest region tertiari care center patient method retrospect observ descript studi analyz 30 patient diagnos rare breast cancer subtyp treat kfshd januari 2019 decemb 2024 result includ 30 patient rare patholog breast cancer subtyp among eight patient 27 apocrin carcinoma mean age diagnosi group 55 60 year mean tumor size greater 2 cm addit 14 46 patient metaplast carcinoma mean age diagnosi 4560 year tumor size rang 3 5 cm five 17 patient diagnos mucin adenocarcinoma mean age diagnosi 70 year tumor larger 2 cm patient stage n0n1 diseas posit estrogen receptor er progesteron receptor pr neg her2neu immunohistochemistri ihc one 3 patient lymphoepitheliomalik carcinoma diagnos 51 year age tumor size 22x32 cm underw simpl mastectomi sentinel lymph node biopsi slnb tumor histolog grade iii lymphovascular invas intraduct compon also identifi two 7 patient invas ductal carcinoma idc show neuroendocrin differenti posit chromogranin synaptophysin ihc age diagnosi 5565 year tumor size rang 4 6 cm tumor histolog grade iii hormon receptorposit her2neu neg surviv outcom vari across group mucin carcinoma show favor prognosi conclus rare subtyp invas breast cancer distinct clinic patholog behaviour differ outcom recognit tumor help patienttailor treatment strategi contribut better patient manag

Herein, we present a case of a 64-year-old male patient presenting with urethral metastasis of prostate adenocarcinoma. This patient initially presented in May 2024 with visible haematuria, with flexible cystoscopy in July 2024 revealing a polypoid lesion in the anterior urethra measuring 1.5 cm and a second villous growth in the prostatic fossa. The patient's initial prostate adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in 2017, managed with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), radical radiotherapy, and adjuvant hormonal therapy up until 2019, with stable disease and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) until 2024. Initial management was resection of both lesions with subsequent repeat cystoscopy for further clearance of the anterior urethral lesion. Histopathological analysis of both lesions revealed the lesion in the prostatic fossa to be a nephrogenic metaplasia and the anterior urethral lesion to be prostatic adenocarcinoma (Gleason 4+4). After a multidisciplinary team discussion, the patient was deemed for further hormonal treatment to manage this new metastatic deposit. Continued oncological review and management are still underway.

cancer,"Bladder cancer commonly presents with haematuria, but its clinical features can vary, and unusual presentations may delay diagnosis. Papillary urothelial carcinoma (PUC) is a frequent subtype, typically arising from the bladder urothelium. While most cases are detected through standard urological symptoms and imaging, the presence of extensive urethral and bladder calculi can obscure the underlying pathology. We describe a 45-year-old man with a history of recurrent urinary stone passage who presented with haematuria following expulsion of a large urethral calculus. Examination revealed palpable stones along the urethra, and imaging demonstrated multiple sizeable, calcified lesions within the bladder and urethra. Cystoscopy confirmed complete obstruction of the penile and bulbar urethra by stones, which were removed cystoscopically. A large calcified intravesical mass was subsequently excised. Histopathological analysis identified high-grade PUC with invasion of the muscularis propria. The patient received intravesical mitomycin C one day after resection, prior to histology results, which showed muscularis propria involvement. The patient underwent further staging with pelvic MRI, which showed no evidence of advanced or metastatic disease, and a computed tomography urogram to visualise the upper tract, which showed no further stones or masses in the kidneys, ureters or collecting system and complete resection of bladder mass. At follow-up, he remained clinically stable with no signs of recurrence or evidence of metastasis. This case highlights an uncommon presentation of muscle-invasive PUC concealed by extensive calculi. It emphasises the importance of maintaining diagnostic vigilance in patients with persistent or atypical urolithiasis and demonstrates the value of early histopathological evaluation and timely postoperative intravesical therapy.",bladder cancer commonli present haematuria clinic featur vari unusu present may delay diagnosi papillari urotheli carcinoma puc frequent subtyp typic aris bladder urothelium case detect standard urolog symptom imag presenc extens urethr bladder calculi obscur underli patholog describ 45yearold man histori recurr urinari stone passag present haematuria follow expuls larg urethr calculu examin reveal palpabl stone along urethra imag demonstr multipl sizeabl calcifi lesion within bladder urethra cystoscopi confirm complet obstruct penil bulbar urethra stone remov cystoscop larg calcifi intraves mass subsequ excis histopatholog analysi identifi highgrad puc invas musculari propria patient receiv intraves mitomycin c one day resect prior histolog result show musculari propria involv patient underw stage pelvic mri show evid advanc metastat diseas comput tomographi urogram visualis upper tract show stone mass kidney uret collect system complet resect bladder mass followup remain clinic stabl sign recurr evid metastasi case highlight uncommon present muscleinvas puc conceal extens calculi emphasis import maintain diagnost vigil patient persist atyp urolithiasi demonstr valu earli histopatholog evalu time postop intraves therapi
cancer,"The sole treatment for pancreatic cancer, which is a hazardous condition, is surgery, which has a high postoperative morbidity rate. Traditional perioperative care often makes the healing process more difficult and increases the risk of problems. The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols that were created to address colorectal operations are intended to alleviate surgical trauma and promote recovery based on evidence-based, multimodal interventions. The current review will focus on the ongoing problem of the high rate of pancreatic resection morbidity and consider the effectiveness and applicability of ERAS in the same context. The aim is to critically evaluate clinical outcomes and barriers to implementation by performing a narrative synthesis of trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses. The important results imply that the use of ERAS protocols minimizes complications, decreases the length of hospital stays, and enhances recovery without mortality or readmission. Key challenges are the emphasis on protocol compliance, institutional issues, and limited representation of high-risk groups, namely, the elderly and infirm. The review concludes that, although ERAS has apparent advantages, its success is based on readiness, a robust multidisciplinary approach involving surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, dietitians, physiotherapists, and pain specialists to ensure coordinated care, and high protocol fidelity of the institution. The implications are that ERAS guidelines will have to be standardized, digital adherence tools will also be necessary, and multicenter trials will need to be inclusive of diverse patient populations. The review offers an elaborate model that can be used to achieve improved, fairer, and patient-centered perioperative care in pancreatic oncology.",sole treatment pancreat cancer hazard condit surgeri high postop morbid rate tradit periop care often make heal process difficult increas risk problem enhanc recoveri surgeri era protocol creat address colorect oper intend allevi surgic trauma promot recoveri base evidencebas multimod intervent current review focu ongo problem high rate pancreat resect morbid consid effect applic era context aim critic evalu clinic outcom barrier implement perform narr synthesi trial observ studi metaanalys import result impli use era protocol minim complic decreas length hospit stay enhanc recoveri without mortal readmiss key challeng emphasi protocol complianc institut issu limit represent highrisk group name elderli infirm review conclud although era appar advantag success base readi robust multidisciplinari approach involv surgeon anesthesiologist nurs dietitian physiotherapist pain specialist ensur coordin care high protocol fidel institut implic era guidelin standard digit adher tool also necessari multicent trial need inclus divers patient popul review offer elabor model use achiev improv fairer patientcent periop care pancreat oncolog
cancer,"The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models and image-generation tools, is poised to transform the field of urology. These technologies enable innovative applications in medical education, clinical decision support, patient communication, and surgical planning, extending beyond traditional analytical AI by creating new content, from synthetic clinical notes to simulated surgical environments. In urology, these capabilities translate into automated summarization of complex patient histories, generation of patient-specific three-dimensional anatomical reconstructions, and support for differential diagnosis in conditions such as prostate cancer or renal masses. However, the rapid adoption of generative AI also introduces significant ethical, legal, and clinical challenges. Risks are amplified in urological practice, where sensitive imaging data, biomarker profiles, and diagnostic decision pathways may be vulnerable to privacy breaches, algorithmic bias, or erroneous AI-generated recommendations. Hallucinated outputs, such as incorrect treatment summaries or misinterpreted radiologic features, can directly compromise patient safety if not rigorously validated. This review synthesizes the current landscape of generative AI in urology, critically examines these discipline-specific risks, and proposes a structured framework for responsible integration into clinical workflows. We highlight the need for transparent governance, bias mitigation, prospective validation, and interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure that generative AI enhances, rather than undermines, the quality, equity, and safety of urologic care.",emerg gener artifici intellig ai particularli larg languag model imagegener tool pois transform field urolog technolog enabl innov applic medic educ clinic decis support patient commun surgic plan extend beyond tradit analyt ai creat new content synthet clinic note simul surgic environ urolog capabl translat autom summar complex patient histori gener patientspecif threedimension anatom reconstruct support differenti diagnosi condit prostat cancer renal mass howev rapid adopt gener ai also introduc signific ethic legal clinic challeng risk amplifi urolog practic sensit imag data biomark profil diagnost decis pathway may vulner privaci breach algorithm bia erron aigener recommend hallucin output incorrect treatment summari misinterpret radiolog featur directli compromis patient safeti rigor valid review synthes current landscap gener ai urolog critic examin disciplinespecif risk propos structur framework respons integr clinic workflow highlight need transpar govern bia mitig prospect valid interdisciplinari collabor ensur gener ai enhanc rather undermin qualiti equiti safeti urolog care
cancer,"Tumor-to-tumor metastasis is a rare oncologic phenomenon in which one primary malignancy metastasizes into another distinct neoplasm. While meningiomas are the most common recipients, this route of recurrence has not been reported in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated lung adenocarcinoma. A 74-year-old female patient, who had remained disease-free for 14 years after undergoing right upper lobectomy for stage IA (pT1N0M0) lung adenocarcinoma, presented with headache and vomiting. Brain MRI demonstrated a 30 x 35 mm mass in the left parietal lobe with both solid and cystic portions abutting the dura and associated with surrounding edema, which was subsequently resected. Histopathological examination showed an admixture of meningioma and adenocarcinoma components, consistent with tumor-to-tumor metastasis. Immunohistochemistry revealed adenocarcinoma cells positive for thyroid transcription factor-1, Napsin A, and cytokeratin 7, supporting a pulmonary origin. Molecular testing identified an EGFR exon 19 deletion in both the intracranial lesion and the primary lung adenocarcinoma resected 14 years earlier, confirming a shared clonal origin. Following diagnosis, the patient received postoperative radiation therapy followed by osimertinib, and she remains recurrence-free three years after surgery. This case highlights an exceptionally rare pattern of recurrence, tumor-to-tumor metastasis of EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma after right upper lobectomy into a meningioma, occurring 14 years after curative surgery. Oncologists should recognize that EGFR-mutated lung cancer can recur after an exceptionally long disease-free interval through rare metastatic patterns such as tumor-to-tumor metastasis.",tumortotumor metastasi rare oncolog phenomenon one primari malign metastas anoth distinct neoplasm meningioma common recipi rout recurr report epiderm growth factor receptor egfrmut lung adenocarcinoma 74yearold femal patient remain diseasefre 14 year undergo right upper lobectomi stage ia pt1n0m0 lung adenocarcinoma present headach vomit brain mri demonstr 30 x 35 mm mass left pariet lobe solid cystic portion abut dura associ surround edema subsequ resect histopatholog examin show admixtur meningioma adenocarcinoma compon consist tumortotumor metastasi immunohistochemistri reveal adenocarcinoma cell posit thyroid transcript factor1 napsin cytokeratin 7 support pulmonari origin molecular test identifi egfr exon 19 delet intracrani lesion primari lung adenocarcinoma resect 14 year earlier confirm share clonal origin follow diagnosi patient receiv postop radiat therapi follow osimertinib remain recurrencefre three year surgeri case highlight except rare pattern recurr tumortotumor metastasi egfrmut lung adenocarcinoma right upper lobectomi meningioma occur 14 year cur surgeri oncologist recogn egfrmut lung cancer recur except long diseasefre interv rare metastat pattern tumortotumor metastasi

cancer,"Chromosome instability (CIN) remains among the most important problems in modern cancer research. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify genes that contribute to CIN. To achieve this, we used a human artificial chromosome in a novel sensitized screen to measure CIN. We screened 18,658 genes for their roles in maintaining chromosomal stability and identified 834 candidates as potential CIN genes. A secondary RNAi screen identified 44 genes with the most pronounced CIN phenotypes. In guilt-by-association analysis using a published set of 8,498 proteins across a panel of 949 cancer cell lines, this cohort of 44 genes displayed a striking correlation with mitotic regulators. Furthermore, altered expression of these proteins was associated with a poor prognosis across multiple cancer types. Specifically, downregulation of AMY2B, ALAD, PDGFRA, PPIE, VEZ1, and TTC19 is associated with poor survival in two or more of the following: small cell lung cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer. The genes identified in this screen hold potential as prognostic markers for patient survival across several cancer types and could potentially serve as targets for the development of new therapeutic approaches aimed at mitigating CIN.",chromosom instabl cin remain among import problem modern cancer research studi conduct genomewid rnai screen identifi gene contribut cin achiev use human artifici chromosom novel sensit screen measur cin screen 18658 gene role maintain chromosom stabil identifi 834 candid potenti cin gene secondari rnai screen identifi 44 gene pronounc cin phenotyp guiltbyassoci analysi use publish set 8498 protein across panel 949 cancer cell line cohort 44 gene display strike correl mitot regul furthermor alter express protein associ poor prognosi across multipl cancer type specif downregul amy2b alad pdgfra ppie vez1 ttc19 associ poor surviv two follow small cell lung cancer lung adenocarcinoma adrenocort carcinoma ovarian cancer breast cancer gene identifi screen hold potenti prognost marker patient surviv across sever cancer type could potenti serv target develop new therapeut approach aim mitig cin
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Globally, cervical cancer can be cured if diagnosed at an early stage and treated promptly. However, this is rarely done in low- and middle-income countries, where the highest rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are reported. In Uganda, less than 20% of the targeted population utilize cervical cancer screening services despite these being readily available in health facilities across the country at no cost. We aimed to determine the factors associated with utilization of cervical cancer screening services among women of reproductive age at Mbale regional referral hospital in eastern Uganda. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving 355 participants, we recruited clients attending the family planning clinic at Mbale regional referral hospital. We conducted multivariable logistic regression to determine the factors associated with utilization of cervical cancer screening services. Data were analyzed in Stata version 14.1. RESULTS: Only 33/355 (9.3 %) women had ever utilized cervical cancer screening services. Majority of the women 23/33(69.7 %) who had ever screened for cervical cancer, did so after recommendation by a health worker. Utilization of cervical cancer screening services was associated with: maternal age of 30 years and above [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 11.25 Confidence Interval (CI) (3.67-34.55)] and being more knowledgeable about cervical cancer [AOR 5.13 95 % CI (1.75-15.08)]. CONCLUSION: Adequate knowledge about cervical cancer and level of utilization of cervical cancer screening services was low among women at a regional referral hospital in Eastern Uganda. We recommend the following interventions targeted at increasing access to services and health literacy levels in the community. 1. Integrating cervical cancer screening into existing community outreach programs such as immunization. 2. Use of mass media and text messages in local dialects to communicate information about cervical cancer. 3. Community led campaigns and outreaches aimed at educating the public about risk factors and available methods of prevention of cervical cancer. 4. Health workers are also encouraged to routinely recommend and encourage cervical cancer screening services to all women of reproductive age that are under their care.",background global cervic cancer cure diagnos earli stage treat promptli howev rare done low middleincom countri highest rate cervic cancer incid mortal report uganda less 20 target popul util cervic cancer screen servic despit readili avail health facil across countri cost aim determin factor associ util cervic cancer screen servic among women reproduct age mbale region referr hospit eastern uganda method crosssect studi involv 355 particip recruit client attend famili plan clinic mbale region referr hospit conduct multivari logist regress determin factor associ util cervic cancer screen servic data analyz stata version 141 result 33355 93 women ever util cervic cancer screen servic major women 2333697 ever screen cervic cancer recommend health worker util cervic cancer screen servic associ matern age 30 year adjust odd ratio aor 1125 confid interv ci 3673455 knowledg cervic cancer aor 513 95 ci 1751508 conclus adequ knowledg cervic cancer level util cervic cancer screen servic low among women region referr hospit eastern uganda recommend follow intervent target increas access servic health literaci level commun 1 integr cervic cancer screen exist commun outreach program immun 2 use mass media text messag local dialect commun inform cervic cancer 3 commun led campaign outreach aim educ public risk factor avail method prevent cervic cancer 4 health worker also encourag routin recommend encourag cervic cancer screen servic women reproduct age care
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and safety of a domestically developed, single-arm single-port robotic system for performing complex gynecological surgeries under extreme conditions, such as ultra-remote locations and high-altitude environments. METHODS: In November and December 2024, a surgeon on the campus of West China Second Hospital, Sichuan University in Chengdu remotely manipulated a domestically developed single-arm, single-port robotic surgical system via a high-speed, low-latency communication network to perform two telesurgical procedures. The first procedure was a transumbilical single-port robot-assisted laparoscopic total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and left ovarian cystectomy on a patient with multiple uterine fibroids at the Maternity and Child Health Hospital of Xizang Autonomous Region (distance between Chengdu and Lhasa > 2000 km and altitude difference >3000 m). The second procedure was a transumbilical single-port robot-assisted laparoscopic total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and sentinel lymph node biopsy on a patient with FIGO stage IA endometrial cancer at Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University in Guangzhou (the distance between Chengdu and Guangzhou > 1500 km). Perioperative data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Both procedures were successfully completed without conversion to laparotomy or the use of additional auxiliary ports. The operative times for the Chengdu-Lhasa and Chengdu-Guangzhou surgeries were 90 minutes and 135 minutes, respectively, with estimated blood loss </= 50 mL in both cases. The intraoperative bidirectional network latency remained around 40 ms, and the total end-to-end latency was less than 60 ms. The surgeon reported no perceptible delay in instrumental response. Both patients recovered well postoperatively, and no surgery-related complications or disease recurrence were observed during follow-up until July 2025. CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence supporting the feasibility and safety of a domestically developed single-arm, single-port robotic system for performing complex gynecological surgeries in ultra-remote and high-altitude settings. This technical approach offers a promising solution to address geographic disparities in access to high-quality medical resources and demonstrates significant potential for improving the availability of advanced minimally invasive surgery in remote areas and regions of special settings.",object evalu feasibl safeti domest develop singlearm singleport robot system perform complex gynecolog surgeri extrem condit ultraremot locat highaltitud environ method novemb decemb 2024 surgeon campu west china second hospit sichuan univers chengdu remot manipul domest develop singlearm singleport robot surgic system via highspe lowlat commun network perform two telesurg procedur first procedur transumbil singleport robotassist laparoscop total hysterectomi bilater salpingectomi left ovarian cystectomi patient multipl uterin fibroid matern child health hospit xizang autonom region distanc chengdu lhasa 2000 km altitud differ 3000 second procedur transumbil singleport robotassist laparoscop total hysterectomi bilater salpingooophorectomi sentinel lymph node biopsi patient figo stage ia endometri cancer zhujiang hospit southern medic univers guangzhou distanc chengdu guangzhou 1500 km periop data collect analyz result procedur success complet without convers laparotomi use addit auxiliari port oper time chengdulhasa chengduguangzh surgeri 90 minut 135 minut respect estim blood loss 50 ml case intraop bidirect network latenc remain around 40 ms total endtoend latenc less 60 ms surgeon report percept delay instrument respons patient recov well postop surgeryrel complic diseas recurr observ followup juli 2025 conclus studi provid preliminari evid support feasibl safeti domest develop singlearm singleport robot system perform complex gynecolog surgeri ultraremot highaltitud set technic approach offer promis solut address geograph dispar access highqual medic resourc demonstr signific potenti improv avail advanc minim invas surgeri remot area region special set
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular targets and signaling pathways involved in the therapeutic effects of Lishukang Capsule (LSK) in a rat model of high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) using a proteomics-based approach. METHODS: A total of 60 male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to a control group, a HAPE model group, 3 LSK treatment groups receiving low-, medium-, and high-dose LSK, respectively, and a Rhodiola rosea (also known as Hongjitian [HJT] in pinyin, a Chinese Romanization system) control group. After HAPE modeling, the pharmacodynamic effects were assessed and the optimal LSK dose was determined using HE stains, inflammatory cytokine quantification, lung tissue water content, and the protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage. Label free quantitative proteomic profiling was then applied to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the optimal dose group, using a screening threshold of over 1.5-fold change and P < 0.05. The selected DEPs were validated with Western blotting, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. RESULTS: The medium-dose LSK group exhibited significant anti-HAPE effects. Findings from the proteomic analysis revealed, in the comparison with the control group, 267 DEPs were identified in the HAPE group. In the comparison with the HAPE group, 225 DEPs were identified in the medium-dose LSK group. A total of 112 DEPs in the control group were normalized following LSK treatment in the medium-dose LSK group. In addition, GO enrichment analysis of proteins differentially expressed between the HAPE and LSK group showed that these DEPs were mainly enriched in 12 biological processes, 2 cellular components, and 5 molecular functions. KEGG pathway analysis showed that LSK activated pathways associated with cell adhesion molecules, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, DNA replication/nucleotide excision repair, transcriptional dysregulation in cancer, and Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection, while inhibiting pathways associated with glycerophospholipid metabolism. Some differentially expressed proteins with potential functions were verified by Western blotting, including AGPAT5, NCAM1, SRSF3, and PLA2. These differentially expressed proteins were significantly expressed in the normal group, HAPE group, and LSK group, and the validation results were consistent with proteomic findings, indicating the high reliability of the proteomic results. CONCLUSION: LSK exerts a significant protective effect against HAPE. Proteomic analysis suggests that its therapeutic action may be mediated through activating pathways involved in cell adhesion molecules, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, DNA replication/nucleotide excision repair, transcriptional dysregulation in cancer, and HSV-1 infection, alongside inhibition of pathways associated with glycerophospholipid metabolism. The key DEPs identified in these pathways may play crucial roles in the preventive and therapeutic effects of LSK on HAPE.",object investig molecular target signal pathway involv therapeut effect lishukang capsul lsk rat model highaltitud pulmonari edema hape use proteomicsbas approach method total 60 male wistar rat randomli assign control group hape model group 3 lsk treatment group receiv low medium highdos lsk respect rhodiola rosea also known hongjitian hjt pinyin chines roman system control group hape model pharmacodynam effect assess optim lsk dose determin use stain inflammatori cytokin quantif lung tissu water content protein concentr bronchoalveolar lavag label free quantit proteom profil appli identifi differenti express protein dep optim dose group use screen threshold 15fold chang p 005 select dep valid western blot follow gene ontolog go enrich kyoto encyclopedia gene genom kegg pathway enrich analysi result mediumdos lsk group exhibit signific antihap effect find proteom analysi reveal comparison control group 267 dep identifi hape group comparison hape group 225 dep identifi mediumdos lsk group total 112 dep control group normal follow lsk treatment mediumdos lsk group addit go enrich analysi protein differenti express hape lsk group show dep mainli enrich 12 biolog process 2 cellular compon 5 molecular function kegg pathway analysi show lsk activ pathway associ cell adhes molecul glycosaminoglycan biosynthesi dna replicationnucleotid excis repair transcript dysregul cancer herp simplex viru type 1 hsv1 infect inhibit pathway associ glycerophospholipid metabol differenti express protein potenti function verifi western blot includ agpat5 ncam1 srsf3 pla2 differenti express protein significantli express normal group hape group lsk group valid result consist proteom find indic high reliabl proteom result conclus lsk exert signific protect effect hape proteom analysi suggest therapeut action may mediat activ pathway involv cell adhes molecul glycosaminoglycan biosynthesi dna replicationnucleotid excis repair transcript dysregul cancer hsv1 infect alongsid inhibit pathway associ glycerophospholipid metabol key dep identifi pathway may play crucial role prevent therapeut effect lsk hape
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Many studies have found that exosomes have numerous advantages in the early diagnosis of tumors. We detected and analyzed plasma exosomes from lung cancer patients to identify potential biomarkers that could predict brain metastasis. METHOD: The total RNA of plasma exosomes of advanced lung cancer patients was extracted and sequenced. The BLAST software was used to align the predicted target gene sequence against the GO and KEGG databases, thereby acquiring annotation details for the target genes. The selected exosomal miRNAs and short-chain fatty acids were subjected to diagnostic performance validation analysis. RESULTS: Exosomal miR-223-3p, miR-27a-3p, and miR-27b-3p were significantly increased in the plasma exosomes of lung cancer patients with brain metastasis. The concentrations of isobutyric acid (IBA), valeric acid (VA), isovaleric acid (IVA), and acetic acid (AA) were markedly elevated in the plasma exosomes of lung cancer patients with brain metastasis. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that both miR-27a-3p and miR-27b-3p had significant associations with IVA and VA. A multi-biomarker model combining the selected exosomal miRNAs with metabolic molecules could improve the diagnostic performance with an AUC of 0.927. CONCLUSION: Plasma exosomal miR-223-3p, miR-27a-3p, miR-27b-3p, and IBA, IVA, VA, and AA in advanced patients are closely associated with brain metastasis and have the potential to act as biomarkers for predicting brain metastasis in lung cancer patients.",background mani studi found exosom numer advantag earli diagnosi tumor detect analyz plasma exosom lung cancer patient identifi potenti biomark could predict brain metastasi method total rna plasma exosom advanc lung cancer patient extract sequenc blast softwar use align predict target gene sequenc go kegg databas therebi acquir annot detail target gene select exosom mirna shortchain fatti acid subject diagnost perform valid analysi result exosom mir2233p mir27a3p mir27b3p significantli increas plasma exosom lung cancer patient brain metastasi concentr isobutyr acid iba valer acid va isovaler acid iva acet acid aa markedli elev plasma exosom lung cancer patient brain metastasi spearman correl analysi reveal mir27a3p mir27b3p signific associ iva va multibiomark model combin select exosom mirna metabol molecul could improv diagnost perform auc 0927 conclus plasma exosom mir2233p mir27a3p mir27b3p iba iva va aa advanc patient close associ brain metastasi potenti act biomark predict brain metastasi lung cancer patient

We present a patient who developed ALT/AST elevations after each subcutaneous injection, followed by improvement after withdrawal and hepatoprotective therapy, with positive rechallenge upon re-exposure. By the EASL definition, the R-value was  approximately 6.0, indicating a hepatocellular pattern; Hy's law was not fulfilled. Causality assessed with the updated RUCAM (2016) yielded a total score of 11, corresponding to highly probable. Although the ALT peak did not exceed 5 x ULN, the consistent temporal association and positive rechallenge prompted discontinuation/adjustment of goserelin with close biochemical follow-up, achieving a favorable outcome. This case underscores the need for vigilant monitoring-particularly with higher doses or re-exposure-and highlights the utility of R-value typing, Hy's law, and the updated RUCAM in guiding management.

cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Virtual Reality (VR) is an advanced technological system which, besides its use in entertainment and education, has been permanently introduced over the past quarter-century into physical and psychiatric rehabilitation as well as medicine. Its effectiveness has been demonstrated in pain management during medical and rehabilitation procedures in burn patients, alleviation of cancer pain, and reduction of labor pain. VR is increasingly used during routine medical procedures in children, such as blood sampling, intravenous cannulation, and vaccination, and holds promise for chronic pain management. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess pain during the treatment of hard-to-heal wounds of vascular origin using VR as an adjunct non-pharmacological pain therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational study was conducted in a chronic wound care clinic involving 100 patients. The mean age was 68.02 +/- 10.0 years. All participants had hard-to-heal wounds of vascular origin. The mean wound duration was 7.16 +/- 5.08 months, with an average wound area of 39.18 +/- 71.83 cm(2) (range 2 cm(2) to 625 cm(2)). Patients were randomly assigned to a group distracted with VR goggles and a control group receiving standard care without VR. Pain intensity was assessed using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at three time points, and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) before the procedure, during wound debridement, and 10 min after completion. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed in pain assessment before and during wound debridement (p < 0.05). In the VR group, higher pain scores were recorded before wound care compared to the control group. Ten minutes before wound debridement, the mean pain intensity in the VR group was 2.60 +/- 1.63, higher than 2.0 +/- 1.53 in the control group. During wound debridement, pain intensity was higher in the control group (4.94 +/- 1.53) compared to the VR group (4.32 +/- 2.17). Pain intensity 10 min after debridement was similar in both groups: control (2.24 +/- 1.41) and VR (2.36 +/- 1.71). These findings support the hypothesis that VR goggles reduce pain intensity. No statistically significant differences in NRS pain scores were found between patients with different wound types in either group (p > 0.05). Variables such as wound duration and wound size influenced pain levels 10 min before wound care. No association was found between sex and pain intensity (p > 0.005). CONCLUSION: Increased pain during procedures involving manipulation of damaged tissues and wound debridement is a common phenomenon. This study confirmed that the use of VR goggles reduces perceived pain levels. The assessment of pain experience and intensity varies depending on the assessment tools used; therefore, a combined quantitative and qualitative evaluation is recommended to accurately determine the usefulness of innovative tools in clinical practice.",introduct virtual realiti vr advanc technolog system besid use entertain educ perman introduc past quartercenturi physic psychiatr rehabilit well medicin effect demonstr pain manag medic rehabilit procedur burn patient allevi cancer pain reduct labor pain vr increasingli use routin medic procedur children blood sampl intraven cannul vaccin hold promis chronic pain manag object aim studi assess pain treatment hardtoh wound vascular origin use vr adjunct nonpharmacolog pain therapi materi method observ studi conduct chronic wound care clinic involv 100 patient mean age 6802 100 year particip hardtoh wound vascular origin mean wound durat 716 508 month averag wound area 3918 7183 cm2 rang 2 cm2 625 cm2 patient randomli assign group distract vr goggl control group receiv standard care without vr pain intens assess use numer rate scale nr three time point mcgill pain questionnair mpq procedur wound debrid 10 min complet result statist signific differ observ pain assess wound debrid p 005 vr group higher pain score record wound care compar control group ten minut wound debrid mean pain intens vr group 260 163 higher 20 153 control group wound debrid pain intens higher control group 494 153 compar vr group 432 217 pain intens 10 min debrid similar group control 224 141 vr 236 171 find support hypothesi vr goggl reduc pain intens statist signific differ nr pain score found patient differ wound type either group p 005 variabl wound durat wound size influenc pain level 10 min wound care associ found sex pain intens p 0005 conclus increas pain procedur involv manipul damag tissu wound debrid common phenomenon studi confirm use vr goggl reduc perceiv pain level assess pain experi intens vari depend assess tool use therefor combin quantit qualit evalu recommend accur determin use innov tool clinic practic
cancer,"The diverse expression of antigenic subtypes on tumor cells can substantially influence the specific binding and tumor cytotoxicity of antibody-recruiting molecules (ARMs). Therefore, the development of multivalent ARMs with high selectivity and affinity for binding to different subtypes on tumor cells can be expected to improve clinical performance. In this study, multivalent ARMs incorporated with multivalent dinitrophenyl (DNP) haptens and an integrin-specific arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) macrocyclic peptide were synthesized using a chemoenzymatic approach. The molecules specifically recognized integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-positive tumor cells and exhibited robust antibody recruitment capacity and tumor-killing effects depending on the multivalent effects. Notably, the D3 molecule showed excellent anti-DNP antibody recruitment capacity in the alpha(v)beta(3)-positive tumor cells and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)-mediated tumor cytotoxicity. Given the variable expression of integrin receptor subtypes among individuals, the multivalent ARMs developed in this study that specifically target alpha(v)beta(3)-positive tumor cells to enhance cancer cytotoxicity represent a promising strategy for tumor immunotherapy.",divers express antigen subtyp tumor cell substanti influenc specif bind tumor cytotox antibodyrecruit molecul arm therefor develop multival arm high select affin bind differ subtyp tumor cell expect improv clinic perform studi multival arm incorpor multival dinitrophenyl dnp hapten integrinspecif arginineglycineaspart acid rgd macrocycl peptid synthes use chemoenzymat approach molecul specif recogn integrin alphavbeta3posit tumor cell exhibit robust antibodi recruit capac tumorkil effect depend multival effect notabl d3 molecul show excel antidnp antibodi recruit capac alphavbeta3posit tumor cell antibodydepend cellular cytotox adcc complementdepend cytotox cdcmediat tumor cytotox given variabl express integrin receptor subtyp among individu multival arm develop studi specif target alphavbeta3posit tumor cell enhanc cancer cytotox repres promis strategi tumor immunotherapi
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Skin cancer is the most common cancer faced by adults in the United States. Melanoma, while a less common subtype of skin cancer compared to basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas, is associated with greater rates of metastases, mortality, and morbidity, and its rate of incidence is projected to increase. Primary care physicians (PCPs) can play an important role in skin cancer detection and in the decision to refer a patient to a dermatologist. Technologies such as the elastic scattering spectroscopy (ESS) device (DermaSensor, Inc.), a handheld, noninvasive assistive tool, may help in the evaluation of a skin growth and improve appropriate referral decision making. METHODS: A total of 50 malignant and 50 benign lesions were assessed by each of the 118 physicians (board-certified internal and family medicine physicians), yielding 5,900 malignant and benign lesion assessments without the device and 5,900 with the ESS device. Physicians were also surveyed regarding their confidence in their management decision. RESULTS: The study met the primary endpoint; the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of the PCPs aided with the device was 0.671 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.611-0.732) compared with the AUROC unaided by the device of 0.630 (95% CI: 0.582-0.678), a significant increase (p=0.036). When asked whether the device would provide value to their decision making, 91.5% of respondents either agreed or strongly agreed.

cancer,"OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to evaluate the feasibility, educational outcomes, and cost-savings of free dermatologic screenings at local farmers' markets and a church in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. METHODS: We piloted six free skin cancer screenings at farmers' markets and a church in Oklahoma. Exposed areas were examined by dermatology residents under supervision of a board-certified dermatologist. Suspicious lesions were referred. Pre- and postscreening surveys assessed knowledge, sunscreen use, and barriers to care. Demographics and ZIP codes were collected. Follow-up was conducted at 6 months. We estimated cost savings per screening using published visit costs and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) mileage rates. Statistical analysis included paired t-tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and chi-square tests (p<0.05). RESULTS: Among 411 adults, 40 participants (9.7%) had notable lesions, including 7 confirmed basal cell carcinomas and 23 actinic keratoses. Awareness of risk-reducing practices and lesion recognition increased significantly postcounseling (both p<0.0001). The most reported barrier to dermatology was lack of perceived need. Estimated cost savings per participant was $156.70, totaling $64,403.70 across all participants. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include reliance on self-reported survey data, incomplete follow-up among referred participants, and lack of histopathologic confirmation for all findings. CONCLUSION: This study shows the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of free skin screenings when paired with local farmers' markets, which often provide complimentary spaces for nonprofit organizations. These low-cost models may enhance earlier detection and awareness in communities with limited access.",object author sought evalu feasibl educ outcom costsav free dermatolog screen local farmer market church oklahoma citi oklahoma method pilot six free skin cancer screen farmer market church oklahoma expos area examin dermatolog resid supervis boardcertifi dermatologist suspici lesion refer pre postscreen survey assess knowledg sunscreen use barrier care demograph zip code collect followup conduct 6 month estim cost save per screen use publish visit cost intern revenu servic ir mileag rate statist analysi includ pair ttest analysi varianc anova chisquar test p005 result among 411 adult 40 particip 97 notabl lesion includ 7 confirm basal cell carcinoma 23 actin keratos awar riskreduc practic lesion recognit increas significantli postcounsel p00001 report barrier dermatolog lack perceiv need estim cost save per particip 15670 total 6440370 across particip limit limit includ relianc selfreport survey data incomplet followup among refer particip lack histopatholog confirm find conclus studi show feasibl costeffect free skin screen pair local farmer market often provid complimentari space nonprofit organ lowcost model may enhanc earlier detect awar commun limit access
cancer,"Background Understanding the surgical outcomes following surgery for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is crucial for proper consent and informed decision-making. Contemporary recommendations to guide IBD surgical intervention now favor a minimally invasive approach, if possible. We present surgical outcomes following the introduction of robotic minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for IBD in a tertiary center. Aim Robotic approaches to colorectal resections are now becoming routine for colorectal cancer surgery but use in IBD is still not currently mainstream. Here, we describe our initial experience with robotic IBD surgery and compare 30-day surgical outcomes to laparoscopic and open approaches. Methods A single tertiary referral center experience of all patients over 16 years of age undergoing surgery for IBD between 2020 and 2023 was analyzed. This retrospective review of all prospectively gathered surgical data utilized the hospital database and prospectively recorded ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) records detailing patient recovery and complications. For the statistical calculations, we used ANOVA for overall data and Tukey's HSD for comparing each cohort. Results A total of 140 cases were analyzed, showing mean procedure time in minutes across robotic, laparoscopic, and open approaches (p=0.997): colectomies (268, 282, 265), panproctocolectomies (380, 425, 382), proctectomies (315, 259, 228), and small bowel resections (161, 165, 202). There was zero mortality across all groups. For robotic, laparoscopic, and open approaches, the major complications (Clavien-Dindo classification 3+) rates were 5.4%, 8%, and 3.5% (p=0.686), respectively, and the readmission rates were 8.10%, 9.33%, and 21.42%, respectively. The mean post-operative stays in days (p=0.164) were as follows: colectomies (6.70, 8.45, 10.33), panproctocolectomy (8.40, 8.92, 10.29), completion proctectomy (6.00, 5.00, 8.20), and ileocecal/small bowel resection (6.42, 6.46, 6.80). The costs for patients undergoing robotic surgery were higher (p=0.11). Conclusion This early data demonstrate real-world experience of the introduction of robotic surgical techniques for colorectal resection. Robotic surgical outcomes demonstrate equivalence with the laparoscopic outcomes and are improved compared to open procedures in most metrics but are more expensive.",background understand surgic outcom follow surgeri inflammatori bowel diseas ibd crucial proper consent inform decisionmak contemporari recommend guid ibd surgic intervent favor minim invas approach possibl present surgic outcom follow introduct robot minim invas surgeri mi ibd tertiari center aim robot approach colorect resect becom routin colorect cancer surgeri use ibd still current mainstream describ initi experi robot ibd surgeri compar 30day surgic outcom laparoscop open approach method singl tertiari referr center experi patient 16 year age undergo surgeri ibd 2020 2023 analyz retrospect review prospect gather surgic data util hospit databas prospect record era enhanc recoveri surgeri record detail patient recoveri complic statist calcul use anova overal data tukey hsd compar cohort result total 140 case analyz show mean procedur time minut across robot laparoscop open approach p0997 colectomi 268 282 265 panproctocolectomi 380 425 382 proctectomi 315 259 228 small bowel resect 161 165 202 zero mortal across group robot laparoscop open approach major complic claviendindo classif 3 rate 54 8 35 p0686 respect readmiss rate 810 933 2142 respect mean postop stay day p0164 follow colectomi 670 845 1033 panproctocolectomi 840 892 1029 complet proctectomi 600 500 820 ileocecalsmal bowel resect 642 646 680 cost patient undergo robot surgeri higher p011 conclus earli data demonstr realworld experi introduct robot surgic techniqu colorect resect robot surgic outcom demonstr equival laparoscop outcom improv compar open procedur metric expens
cancer,"BACKGROUND: The colorectal cancer (CRC) screening adherence rate among the uninsured population in the United States (US) is lower than the overall rate across all US adults aged 45 to 75. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of community health worker (CHW) navigation services promoting CRC screening in a low-income, uninsured population. METHODS: Using internal cost and effectiveness data from the Texas A&M Cancer Screening, Training, Education, and Prevention (CSTEP) program, which included 3196 participants, along with published sources such as the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations, we estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for CRC screening with CHW navigation versus usual care. The analysis was conducted from a societal perspective using Excel-based modeling in hypothetical cohorts initiating screening at age 45. RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, a 10 percentage-point improvement in CRC screening attributable to the program increased LYG by 0.160 at an additional lifetime cost of $101, resulting in an ICER of $3098 per LYG. One-way and two-way sensitivity analyses were conducted, varying program costs, screening rate improvements, lifetime CRC costs, and life-years gained (LYG). CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the importance of CHW navigation services incorporating CRC screening promotion strategies tailored to uninsured populations to alleviate disparities in colorectal cancer screening and outcomes. Further research should consider the characteristics of uninsured populations, and the applicability of the program targeted for various types of underserved populations.",background colorect cancer crc screen adher rate among uninsur popul unit state us lower overal rate across us adult age 45 75 object assess costeffect commun health worker chw navig servic promot crc screen lowincom uninsur popul method use intern cost effect data texa cancer screen train educ prevent cstep program includ 3196 particip along publish sourc us prevent servic task forc uspstf recommend estim increment costeffect ratio icer crc screen chw navig versu usual care analysi conduct societ perspect use excelbas model hypothet cohort initi screen age 45 result basecas assumpt 10 percentagepoint improv crc screen attribut program increas lyg 0160 addit lifetim cost 101 result icer 3098 per lyg oneway twoway sensit analys conduct vari program cost screen rate improv lifetim crc cost lifeyear gain lyg conclus find underscor import chw navig servic incorpor crc screen promot strategi tailor uninsur popul allevi dispar colorect cancer screen outcom research consid characterist uninsur popul applic program target variou type underserv popul
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Foregut cancers are best treated by specialized, multidisciplinary care, often delivered, at least in part, at tertiary centers. Patient perspectives on the factors that enhance access to and adherence to cancer treatment remain underexplored. This qualitative study explores patient-reported facilitators of care at a safety-net hospital in the Southeastern United States (US). METHODS: Patients with foregut cancer receiving care at a safety-net tertiary care institution in the Southeastern US were recruited. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using NVivo 14 Software. Grounded theory methodology was used to identify themes and subthemes. A comprehensive codebook was established, with a high interrater reliability rate of > 90 % for all themes. RESULTS: Of the 30 patients interviewed, the majority were male (n = 23, 77 %) and Black (n = 18, 60 %), with an average age of 63 (IQR: 55-67). Facilitator themes were identified across four categories: (1) Individual/Interpersonal; (2) Provider/Care Team; (3) Healthcare Systems, and (4) Broader Policy. The most prevalent facilitators identified included faith and spirituality (87 %), support from immediate family (83 %), trust in the care team (90 %), and effective communication (97 %). CONCLUSION: Understanding patient perspectives is essential for delivering high-quality care in foregut cancer. These facilitators should be actively promoted during the development of future interventions. An appreciation of patient beliefs, communication training for care providers, hiring necessary ancillary staff, use of written handouts, expanding financial aid services, and wider healthcare reform are all avenues to explore in the ongoing effort to improve comprehensive oncological care for patients.",background foregut cancer best treat special multidisciplinari care often deliv least part tertiari center patient perspect factor enhanc access adher cancer treatment remain underexplor qualit studi explor patientreport facilit care safetynet hospit southeastern unit state us method patient foregut cancer receiv care safetynet tertiari care institut southeastern us recruit interview record transcrib analyz use nvivo 14 softwar ground theori methodolog use identifi theme subthem comprehens codebook establish high interrat reliabl rate 90 theme result 30 patient interview major male n 23 77 black n 18 60 averag age 63 iqr 5567 facilit theme identifi across four categori 1 individualinterperson 2 providercar team 3 healthcar system 4 broader polici preval facilit identifi includ faith spiritu 87 support immedi famili 83 trust care team 90 effect commun 97 conclus understand patient perspect essenti deliv highqual care foregut cancer facilit activ promot develop futur intervent appreci patient belief commun train care provid hire necessari ancillari staff use written handout expand financi aid servic wider healthcar reform avenu explor ongo effort improv comprehens oncolog care patient
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a aggressive cancer associated with high morbidity and mortality globally. Reliable biomarkers are urgently needed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and survival outcomes in patients with HCC. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of cleavage stimulation factor subunit 1 (CSTF1) in HCC. METHODS: CSTF1 expression in different cancer types, including HCC, was analyzed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess CSTF1 expression in clinical samples. Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate associations between CSTF1 expression and the clinical characteristics of patients with HCC. Furthermore, Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed to identify signaling pathways and biological functions linked to differentially expressed genes. The prognostic significance of CSTF1 in HCC was assessed via the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox univariate and multivariate analyses. Immune cell infiltration was investigated through single-sample GSEA and the CIBERSORT algorithm. Three nomograms were constructed to predict overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression free interval (PFI) rates at 1, 3, and 5 years after diagnosis. RESULTS: CSTF1 expression was elevated in HCC cases and closely correlated with multiple clinical features. Elevated CSTF1 expression was strongly associated with various cancer-related pathways and the immune microenvironment. The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that elevated CSTF1 expression predicts poorer prognostic outcomes in individuals with HCC. CSTF1 hypermethylation was also related to poor patient outcomes. The constructed nomograms for OS, DSS, and PFI achieved concordance indices of 0.631, 0.719 and 0.787, respectively. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that CSTF1 can serve as a novel prognostic biomarker for HCC. Evidence from immunohistochemistry and bioinformatics analyses supports CSTF1 as a prognostic indicator and a potential therapeutic target. This discovery could enhance diagnostic precision and improve survival outcomes for patients with HCC.",background hepatocellular carcinoma hcc aggress cancer associ high morbid mortal global reliabl biomark urgent need enhanc diagnost accuraci surviv outcom patient hcc studi aim evalu prognost valu cleavag stimul factor subunit 1 cstf1 hcc method cstf1 express differ cancer type includ hcc analyz use data cancer genom atla immunohistochemistri perform assess cstf1 express clinic sampl logist regress analys use evalu associ cstf1 express clinic characterist patient hcc furthermor gene ontolog kyoto encyclopedia gene genom gene set enrich analysi gsea perform identifi signal pathway biolog function link differenti express gene prognost signific cstf1 hcc assess via kaplanmei method cox univari multivari analys immun cell infiltr investig singlesampl gsea cibersort algorithm three nomogram construct predict overal surviv os diseasespecif surviv dss progress free interv pfi rate 1 3 5 year diagnosi result cstf1 express elev hcc case close correl multipl clinic featur elev cstf1 express strongli associ variou cancerrel pathway immun microenviron kaplanmei analysi reveal elev cstf1 express predict poorer prognost outcom individu hcc cstf1 hypermethyl also relat poor patient outcom construct nomogram os dss pfi achiev concord indic 0631 0719 0787 respect conclus find suggest cstf1 serv novel prognost biomark hcc evid immunohistochemistri bioinformat analys support cstf1 prognost indic potenti therapeut target discoveri could enhanc diagnost precis improv surviv outcom patient hcc
cancer,"Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer accounting for a majority of cases. Despite advances in targeted therapies and immunotherapy, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, resistance mechanisms, and limited preclinical models hinder treatment efficacy. Traditional cancer models, including 2D cell cultures and animal models, often fail to accurately replicate the lung's complex architecture, microenvironment, and biomechanical cues, leading to poor predictive performance in drug development. Microfluidic-based organ-on-a-chip technology offers a promising alternative by integrating human-derived cells with precisely controlled perfusion, mechanical cues, and tumor-stroma interactions in physiologically relevant 3D models. These platforms enable the study of lung cancer biology, drug responses, and patient-specific therapeutic outcomes with improved accuracy. In this review, we discuss recent advancements in microfluidic systems for recapitulating normal lung physiology and 3D lung cancer microenvironment, covering various microfluidic platforms with applications in disease modeling and drug testing. Unlike other review articles, we bring first-hand insights from clinicians about the current treatment practice for lung cancer and the clinical utilities of lung cancer-on-a-chip models, which bioengineers have been seeking. We also highlight the translational potential of these systems in personalized oncology and the need for interdisciplinary collaborations, particularly with clinicians, to enhance their clinical impact.",lung cancer remain lead caus cancerrel mortal worldwid nonsmal cell lung cancer account major case despit advanc target therapi immunotherapi challeng tumor heterogen resist mechan limit preclin model hinder treatment efficaci tradit cancer model includ 2d cell cultur anim model often fail accur replic lung complex architectur microenviron biomechan cue lead poor predict perform drug develop microfluidicbas organonachip technolog offer promis altern integr humanderiv cell precis control perfus mechan cue tumorstroma interact physiolog relev 3d model platform enabl studi lung cancer biolog drug respons patientspecif therapeut outcom improv accuraci review discuss recent advanc microfluid system recapitul normal lung physiolog 3d lung cancer microenviron cover variou microfluid platform applic diseas model drug test unlik review articl bring firsthand insight clinician current treatment practic lung cancer clinic util lung canceronachip model bioengin seek also highlight translat potenti system person oncolog need interdisciplinari collabor particularli clinician enhanc clinic impact
cancer,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and fatal lung disease, significantly increases the risk of lung cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, the shared genetic mechanisms driving IPF and LUAD comorbidities remain poorly understood, necessitating integrated multi-omics investigations. Through bulk and single-cell transcriptomic analyses, we identified 308 shared differentially expressed genes enriched in lipid metabolism and immune-inflammatory processes. Additionally, single-cell profiling revealed significant alterations in epithelial cells and macrophage populations between LUAD and IPF tissues, underscoring their role in disease progression. Furthermore, the copy number variation profiling identified a premalignant epithelial subpopulation in IPF exhibiting transcriptional signatures resembling LUAD malignant epithelial cells, and trajectory analysis illustrated a potential temporal progression toward malignancy. To identify co-causal genes, we performed weighted gene coexpression network analysis, defining modules associated with key cell types involved in comorbidities. Moreover, leveraging 101 algorithm combinations across ten machine learning approaches, we constructed a robust prognostic model, pinpointing CHST6 as a top prognostic gene consistently upregulated in both LUAD and IPF. Functional validation confirmed that CHST6 promotes lung cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In conclusion, our findings elucidate the shared molecular landscape of LUAD and IPF and propose that CHST6 is a promising co-disease therapeutic target.",idiopath pulmonari fibrosi ipf progress fatal lung diseas significantli increas risk lung cancer particularli lung adenocarcinoma luad howev share genet mechan drive ipf luad comorbid remain poorli understood necessit integr multiom investig bulk singlecel transcriptom analys identifi 308 share differenti express gene enrich lipid metabol immuneinflammatori process addit singlecel profil reveal signific alter epitheli cell macrophag popul luad ipf tissu underscor role diseas progress furthermor copi number variat profil identifi premalign epitheli subpopul ipf exhibit transcript signatur resembl luad malign epitheli cell trajectori analysi illustr potenti tempor progress toward malign identifi cocaus gene perform weight gene coexpress network analysi defin modul associ key cell type involv comorbid moreov leverag 101 algorithm combin across ten machin learn approach construct robust prognost model pinpoint chst6 top prognost gene consist upregul luad ipf function valid confirm chst6 promot lung cancer cell prolifer migrat invas conclus find elucid share molecular landscap luad ipf propos chst6 promis codiseas therapeut target
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) pose a significant burden on patients with advanced cancer approaching the end of life. However, trends in the prescription of PIMs and the factors associated with deprescribing PIMs in these patients remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in the prescription of PIMs and explore the factors associated with the deprescribing of PIMs in patients with advanced cancer in Japan. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using medical claims data. METHODS: We analyzed patients aged >65 years who were diagnosed with cancer 6 months before death and died between December 2017 and August 2023 in the city of Mito, Ibaraki prefecture, Japan. Sociodemographic, clinical, and prescription data were collected at 6 months (M6), 3 months (M3), and 1 month (M1) before death. PIMs were assessed according to the OncPal Deprescribing Guidelines. RESULTS: The mean age of 1269 patients was 80.6 years, and 62.2% were male. PIMs were prescribed to 77.0% at M6, 76.4% at M3, and 70.0% at M1 (p < 0.001, M6 to M1). The factors associated with deprescribing at least one PIM from M6 to M1 included female sex, number of medications at M6, number of comorbidities, admission to a palliative care unit, and admission to a general ward. CONCLUSION: In patients with advanced cancer, PIM use decreased as they approached death. Deprescribing PIMs was more common in females, patients with polypharmacy and comorbidities, and patients admitted to hospitals, especially palliative care units.",background potenti inappropri medic pim pose signific burden patient advanc cancer approach end life howev trend prescript pim factor associ deprescrib pim patient remain unclear object describ trend prescript pim explor factor associ deprescrib pim patient advanc cancer japan design retrospect cohort studi use medic claim data method analyz patient age 65 year diagnos cancer 6 month death die decemb 2017 august 2023 citi mito ibaraki prefectur japan sociodemograph clinic prescript data collect 6 month m6 3 month m3 1 month m1 death pim assess accord oncpal deprescrib guidelin result mean age 1269 patient 806 year 622 male pim prescrib 770 m6 764 m3 700 m1 p 0001 m6 m1 factor associ deprescrib least one pim m6 m1 includ femal sex number medic m6 number comorbid admiss palli care unit admiss gener ward conclus patient advanc cancer pim use decreas approach death deprescrib pim common femal patient polypharmaci comorbid patient admit hospit especi palli care unit
cancer,"BACKGROUND: While developments in targeted therapy have marked a new epoch for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring actionable genomic alterations, the management of individuals resistant to epithelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) remains a formidable challenge. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of available therapeutic regimens and to identify the optimal treatment strategy for patients with disease progression following EGFR-TKI therapy. DESIGN: This is a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES AND METHODS: Databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov, along with conference proceedings from January 1, 2020, to June 1, 2025, were searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing treatment options for advanced NSCLC patients resistant to EGFR-TKIs were eligible. We identified the optimal therapeutics through comparison of the surface under the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA). RESULTS: Overall, 19 RCTs involving 4,039 participants were identified. Meta-analysis indicated that sacituzumab tirumotecan (Sac-TMT) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS; hazard ratio [HR] 0.20, 95% credible interval [CI] 0.13-0.30) and overall survival (OS; HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.20-0.66) compared to conventional chemotherapy as evidenced by its superior SUCRA values (0.997 for PFS and 0.946 for OS). Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) also demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy outcomes. Specifically, Sac-TMT showed statistically superior PFS benefits relative to nearly all comparator regimens, including immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based and bispecific antibody (bsAb)-based strategies (all p < 0.05). Amivantamab in combination with lazertinib and chemotherapy (SUCRA = 0.816) and ivonescimab combined with chemotherapy (SUCRA = 0.779) both exhibited capabilities in prolonging PFS. Notably, the triplet regimen was associated with the highest incidence of severe-grade AEs compared to all other treatment options. CONCLUSION: Sac-TMT, Dato-DXd, and bsAbs-based regimens were identified as the most efficacious options with manageable toxicity for advanced NSCLC patients who progressed after EGFR-TKIs. These findings underscore the pivotal role of innovative therapeutic agents, illuminating potential treatment avenues for this difficult-to-treat refractory population.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (pLELC) is a rare Epstein-Barr virus-associated subtype of non-small cell lung cancer. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown promising activity, robust predictors of benefit remain lacking. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is widely used but has limited accuracy. Routine blood tests and serum tumor markers (STMs) are inexpensive and universally available, yet their prognostic value in pLELC has not been systematically evaluated. OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate a composite blood-based score integrating hematologic indices and STMs for predicting immunotherapy outcomes in advanced pLELC. DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective cohort study. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 254 patients with advanced pLELC treated with ICIs across six tertiary centers in China. Baseline hematologic indices, serum biochemistry, and STMs were collected. A composite Blood Routine & Tumor-Marker Score (BRTS) was constructed using LASSO Cox regression with progression-free survival (PFS) as the endpoint. Patients were stratified into high- and low-BRTS groups, and prognostic value was validated in an independent cohort. Nomograms combining BRTS with clinical variables were developed and internally validated. RESULTS: High BRTS was associated with significantly shorter PFS and overall survival (OS) in both training (hazard ratio (HR) for PFS = 4.59; OS = 6.86) and validation cohorts (HR for PFS = 5.37; OS = 3.87; all p < 0.001). In multivariate analyses, BRTS remained an independent predictor alongside treatment line, regimen, and liver metastasis, whereas PD-L1 expression lost significance. Nomograms incorporating BRTS demonstrated good discrimination (C-index ~0.79), calibration, and clinical net benefit. Prognostic utility was consistent across treatment lines. CONCLUSION: The BRTS, derived from widely available laboratory tests, robustly stratified immunotherapy outcomes in advanced pLELC and outperformed PD-L1 alone. This simple, low-cost tool may facilitate individualized treatment decisions and warrants prospective validation.",background pulmonari lymphoepitheliomalik carcinoma plelc rare epsteinbarr virusassoci subtyp nonsmal cell lung cancer although immun checkpoint inhibitor ici shown promis activ robust predictor benefit remain lack program deathligand 1 pdl1 wide use limit accuraci routin blood test serum tumor marker stm inexpens univers avail yet prognost valu plelc systemat evalu object develop valid composit bloodbas score integr hematolog indic stm predict immunotherapi outcom advanc plelc design multicent retrospect cohort studi method retrospect analyz 254 patient advanc plelc treat ici across six tertiari center china baselin hematolog indic serum biochemistri stm collect composit blood routin tumormark score brt construct use lasso cox regress progressionfre surviv pf endpoint patient stratifi high lowbrt group prognost valu valid independ cohort nomogram combin brt clinic variabl develop intern valid result high brt associ significantli shorter pf overal surviv os train hazard ratio hr pf 459 os 686 valid cohort hr pf 537 os 387 p 0001 multivari analys brt remain independ predictor alongsid treatment line regimen liver metastasi wherea pdl1 express lost signific nomogram incorpor brt demonstr good discrimin cindex 079 calibr clinic net benefit prognost util consist across treatment line conclus brt deriv wide avail laboratori test robustli stratifi immunotherapi outcom advanc plelc outperform pdl1 alon simpl lowcost tool may facilit individu treatment decis warrant prospect valid
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Prostate biopsy, while essential, often causes discomfort that can affect patient experience and adherence to follow-up procedures. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify factors associated with pain during fusion prostate biopsy to optimize the experience of prostate cancer diagnosis and monitoring. The primary goal was to assess the relationship between pain during viscous lidocaine (lido) instillation and periprostatic nerve block with the overall pain experienced by patients undergoing prostate biopsy. METHODS: We queried our database for patients who underwent transrectal magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion prostate biopsy from March 2020 to July 2023 and had complete pain scores (1-10) recorded during lido instillation, periprostatic nerve block, biopsy, and overall. RESULTS: A total of 779 patients were included. The mean pain scores during lido instillation, periprostatic block, biopsy, and overall were 0.11, 2.8, 3.5, and 3.6, respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed that patients with a pain score during lido instillation of >2 (odds ratio [OR] = 10.28; p=0.027) patients with periprostatic block of >2 (OR = 7.49; p<0.001), black patients (OR = 2.838; p<0.001), and patients on active surveillance (OR = 1.648; p=0.003) were more likely to experience the upper quartile (UQ) of overall pain. Men with abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) findings were less likely to develop the UQ of overall pain than men with normal DRE findings (OR: 0.586; p=0.004). This finding suggests that digital rectal examination during the initial clinic visit can help identify patients who may benefit from sedation during prostate biopsy, potentially improving patient comfort and procedural experience.

cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Arsenic exposure is a well-established risk factor for bladder cancer, but substantial individual variability in susceptibility suggests the potential role of effect modifiers. The gut microbiome, which is influenced by diet, may regulate arsenic metabolism and toxicity. The Dietary Index for Gut Microbiota (DIGM) quantifies the potential of diet to foster a beneficial gut ecosystem, yet its role in modifying arsenic-related carcinogenesis remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the potential interaction between urinary arsenic levels and DIGM on bladder cancer risk. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2018. Bladder cancer status was obtained through self-reported medical questionnaires. Total urinary arsenic was measured using ICP-DRC-MS, and arsenobetaine was subtracted to estimate toxic inorganic arsenic exposure. DIGM was constructed based on 24-h dietary recall data. Weighted multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations, and interaction was tested by including a product term (urinary arsenic*DIGM) and assessed on both additive and multiplicative scales. RESULTS: Among 4,889 participants (mean age 47.47 years; 50.34% male), 585 had bladder cancer. After adjusting for covariates, elevated urinary arsenic was associated with increased bladder cancer risk (OR: 2.22, 95% CI: 1.53-3.22). Interaction analysis revealed a significant multiplicative interaction between urinary arsenic and DIGM (P-interaction = 0.022). Stratified analysis showed a strong positive association between urinary arsenic and bladder cancer in participants in the lowest DIGM tertile (OR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.46-2.61). This association was significantly attenuated and became non-significant in those in the highest DIGM tertile (OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 0.89-1.44). Measures of additive interaction (RERI = 0.47, AP = 0.31) further supported a synergistic effect. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that a diet promoting a healthier gut microbiota, as indicated by a higher DIGM score, may attenuate the association between urinary arsenic exposure and bladder cancer risk. These results indicate that dietary intervention could be a strategic approach to mitigate urinary arsenic-related cancer risk, highlighting the importance of diet-gut-microbiome interactions in environmental carcinogenesis.",object arsen exposur wellestablish risk factor bladder cancer substanti individu variabl suscept suggest potenti role effect modifi gut microbiom influenc diet may regul arsen metabol toxic dietari index gut microbiota digm quantifi potenti diet foster benefici gut ecosystem yet role modifi arsenicrel carcinogenesi remain unclear studi aim investig potenti interact urinari arsen level digm bladder cancer risk method conduct crosssect analysi use data nation health nutrit examin survey nhane 20072018 bladder cancer statu obtain selfreport medic questionnair total urinari arsen measur use icpdrcm arsenobetain subtract estim toxic inorgan arsen exposur digm construct base 24h dietari recal data weight multivari logist regress model use evalu associ interact test includ product term urinari arsenicdigm assess addit multipl scale result among 4889 particip mean age 4747 year 5034 male 585 bladder cancer adjust covari elev urinari arsen associ increas bladder cancer risk 222 95 ci 153322 interact analysi reveal signific multipl interact urinari arsen digm pinteract 0022 stratifi analysi show strong posit associ urinari arsen bladder cancer particip lowest digm tertil 195 95 ci 146261 associ significantli attenu becam nonsignific highest digm tertil 113 95 ci 089144 measur addit interact reri 047 ap 031 support synergist effect conclus find suggest diet promot healthier gut microbiota indic higher digm score may attenu associ urinari arsen exposur bladder cancer risk result indic dietari intervent could strateg approach mitig urinari arsenicrel cancer risk highlight import dietgutmicrobiom interact environment carcinogenesi
cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) residues one of the leading reasons of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with increasing incidence attributed to dietary, environmental, and genetic factors. Despite advances in conventional therapies, including chemotherapy and targeted agents, treatment resistance and adverse side effects highlight the need for novel, safer, and more effective therapeutic strategies. Hesperidin (HSD) and hesperetin (HST), bioflavonoid abundantly found in citrus fruits, has emerged as a promising candidate due to its wide-ranging biological activities, particularly its role in modulating key molecular pathways involved in carcinogenesis. This comprehensive review explores the multifaceted anticancer potential of HSD and HST in the context of CRC, focusing on its ability to control programmed cell death mechanisms like autophagy and apoptosis, suppress chronic inflammation, and counteract oxidative stress-three pivotal hallmarks of tumor initiation and progression. Additionally, we examine the synergistic effects of HSD and HST with standard chemotherapeutic agents and its potential as a chemopreventive or adjuvant therapeutic compound. By consolidating preclinical and emerging clinical evidence, this review highlights the translational value of HSD and HST in CRC prevention and management. Understanding its molecular underpinnings may pave the way for HSD- and HST-based nutraceuticals and targeted therapies, contributing to a more personalized and integrative approach to CRC treatment.",colorect cancer crc residu one lead reason cancerrel mortal worldwid increas incid attribut dietari environment genet factor despit advanc convent therapi includ chemotherapi target agent treatment resist advers side effect highlight need novel safer effect therapeut strategi hesperidin hsd hesperetin hst bioflavonoid abundantli found citru fruit emerg promis candid due widerang biolog activ particularli role modul key molecular pathway involv carcinogenesi comprehens review explor multifacet anticanc potenti hsd hst context crc focus abil control program cell death mechan like autophagi apoptosi suppress chronic inflamm counteract oxid stressthre pivot hallmark tumor initi progress addit examin synergist effect hsd hst standard chemotherapeut agent potenti chemoprevent adjuv therapeut compound consolid preclin emerg clinic evid review highlight translat valu hsd hst crc prevent manag understand molecular underpin may pave way hsd hstbase nutraceut target therapi contribut person integr approach crc treatment
cancer,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in breast cancer has been used for decades in patients with inflammatory, locally advanced, or inoperable breast cancer to achieve or facilitate operability and increase both local and systemic control. This retrospective analysis aims to identify risk factors for failing to achieve a pathological complete response (pCR). Additionally, the study examines factors predicting survival outcomes in breast cancer patients who received NACT. Among 224 patients who underwent NACT between 2010 and 2020, 65 patients achieved pCR. The hormone receptor (HR) status, HER2 amplification, and biological subtype of breast cancer significantly affected the patient's ability to achieve a pCR. Stage of the disease, molecular type, and histological type of breast cancer were significant predictors of overall survival in breast cancer patients who achieved pCR after NACT. Notably, early-stage disease, the luminal subtype of breast cancer, and invasive mammary carcinoma of no special type (NST) were associated with a favorable prognosis.

A 46-year-old premenopausal lady presented with a left breast lump, diagnosed as cT4bN2M0 invasive ductal carcinoma. Imaging revealed a large asymptomatic subserosal uterine fibroid with no signs of metastasis elsewhere. She received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent modified radical mastectomy with total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Histopathology showed metastatic breast carcinoma within the leiomyoma, confirmed by GATA3 positivity and morphological similarity to the breast tumor. The ovaries, fallopian tubes, and cervix were free of disease.

cancer,"The objective of the study is to explore the correlation between inflammation indices (NLR, MLR, PLR) and prognostic factors (myometrial infiltration, LVSI, grading) in FIGO 2023 stage I endometrial carcinoma. From August 2023 to March 2024, a prospective study was conducted on 163 women diagnosed with stage I endometrial cancer. The research methods were established a priori and authorized through evaluation by the Ethics Committee of the individual centers (IRB 30661/2022 of 31/03/2022). The study was then registered on the clinicaltrials.gov platform under NCT05657483. Blood samples were collected preoperatively to measure the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR). Histopathological data on myometrial infiltration, LVSI, and grading were also analyzed. NLR values were 2.07, 2.35, and 2.68 for no infiltration, < 50%, and >/= 50% myometrial infiltration, respectively (p = 0.033). MLR values were 0.20, 0.23, and 0.26 for the same categories (p = 0.029). PLR values were 119, 140, and 146 (p = 0.043). For LVSI, NLR was 2.17 in negative and 3.23 in diffuse (p = 0.010), while MLR showed 0.20 vs 0.24 (p = 0.054), and PLR showed 125 vs 141 (p = 0.033). Multivariate analysis indicated myometrial infiltration had the strongest correlation with inflammation indices (beta 0.07, CI 95% 0.01-0.13, p = 0.041). Inflammation indices (NLR, MLR, PLR) significantly correlate with myometrial infiltration, LVSI positivity, and higher grading in early-stage endometrial carcinoma, with myometrial infiltration showing the strongest association. These findings suggest that inflammation indices could aid in the prognostic evaluation of endometrial carcinoma. Further research is needed to understand the prognostic implications fully.",object studi explor correl inflamm indic nlr mlr plr prognost factor myometri infiltr lvsi grade figo 2023 stage endometri carcinoma august 2023 march 2024 prospect studi conduct 163 women diagnos stage endometri cancer research method establish priori author evalu ethic committe individu center irb 306612022 31032022 studi regist clinicaltrialsgov platform nct05657483 blood sampl collect preoper measur neutrophiltolymphocyt ratio nlr monocytetolymphocyt ratio mlr platelettolymphocyt ratio plr histopatholog data myometri infiltr lvsi grade also analyz nlr valu 207 235 268 infiltr 50 50 myometri infiltr respect p 0033 mlr valu 020 023 026 categori p 0029 plr valu 119 140 146 p 0043 lvsi nlr 217 neg 323 diffus p 0010 mlr show 020 vs 024 p 0054 plr show 125 vs 141 p 0033 multivari analysi indic myometri infiltr strongest correl inflamm indic beta 007 ci 95 001013 p 0041 inflamm indic nlr mlr plr significantli correl myometri infiltr lvsi posit higher grade earlystag endometri carcinoma myometri infiltr show strongest associ find suggest inflamm indic could aid prognost evalu endometri carcinoma research need understand prognost implic fulli
cancer,"PURPOSE: In this section of the INDEPSO-ISPSM consensus, we aimed to address some general principles and technical aspects of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) that could be broadly applied in all patients treated by CRS for peritoneal malignancies. METHODS: The modified Delphi technique was used with two rounds of voting. Fifty-six out of 62 (90.2%) invited surgeons agreed to vote. There were 38 questions on two pain topics: quantitative prognostic indications, radiological and pathological evaluation and general principles of cytoreductive surgery. A consensus was reached if any of the options received 70% or more votes (> 90% = strong consensus). RESULTS: In round 1, 52/56 (92.8%) panelists voted and in round 2, 51/56 (90.1%). A consensus was reached on 31/38 (81.5%) questions (strong consensus on 13/38-34.2%). The panel strongly recommended having a specialist pathologist, a thorough pathological evaluation of CRS specimens, routine recording of radiological peritoneal cancer index and resection of organs like the rectum and spleen when they are directly involved by tumour. The panel did not recommend major hepatectomies, total gastrectomy and pancreaticoduodenectomy as part of CRS when these are required to resect peritoneal disease and total pelvic exenteration with CRS. Perfusion of the thoracic cavity during HIPEC was recommended only when the pleura was involved. A consensus was also reached on two-stage surgeries, visceral and target-region resections. No consensus was reached on routine use of chest tubes, smoke evacuators and timing of preoperative imaging. CONCLUSION: A strong consensus was reached on some widely accepted practices amongst peritoneal oncologists as well as indications for visceral and target-region resections. These recommendations could directly be applied to clinical practice. This consensus points towards a need to standardize technical aspects of CRS by a larger international consensus amongst expert surgeons.

cancer,"Newer systemic treatments are driving us towards axillary conservation to reduce morbidity and enhance quality of life without oncological compromise in breast cancer (BC) patients. It is important to identify which patients might benefit from a more conservative approach to the axilla by studying the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) responses in different subgroups. The aim of the study is to evaluate real-world pathological response rates in breast cancer patients in accordance with latest NACT regimes and also to identify the subsets ideal for axillary de-escalation. This single-centre study at Sri Shankara Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Bangalore, reviewed a prospectively maintained database from January 2023 to May 2024 including all non-metastatic BC patients undergoing surgery after recommended NACT. A total of 224 patients were included for analysis. Pathological complete response (PCR) was achieved by 31.69% (71/224), with 55.3% (124/224) achieving axillary PCR (APCR) and 35.26% (79/224) achieving breast PCR (BPCR). According to subtypes, 65.11% PCR was observed in Her2 subtype, followed by 44.2% in the triple positive, 24.4% in triple negative and 10% in hormone receptor positive. Among patients with cN0 disease, 91.3% (21/23) had APCR, while 63.2% (91/144) of cN1 patients were down-staged to ypN0 and only 17.9% (7/39) of cN2 down-staged to cN0. Combining the Her2-positive and triple-positive groups, 96.2% (51/53) of patients with BPCR had APCR. Pre NACT clinical nodal stage, ER and Her2 neu status can predict APCR with sensitivity of 74.0% with CI of 95% and specificity of 69.0% with CI of 95%. Our study suggests that HER2-positive and triple-positive patients with cN0 and cN1 converted to cN0 are potential candidates for de-escalation of axillary surgery.",newer system treatment drive us toward axillari conserv reduc morbid enhanc qualiti life without oncolog compromis breast cancer bc patient import identifi patient might benefit conserv approach axilla studi neoadjuv chemotherapi nact respons differ subgroup aim studi evalu realworld patholog respons rate breast cancer patient accord latest nact regim also identifi subset ideal axillari deescal singlecentr studi sri shankara cancer hospit research centr bangalor review prospect maintain databas januari 2023 may 2024 includ nonmetastat bc patient undergo surgeri recommend nact total 224 patient includ analysi patholog complet respons pcr achiev 3169 71224 553 124224 achiev axillari pcr apcr 3526 79224 achiev breast pcr bpcr accord subtyp 6511 pcr observ her2 subtyp follow 442 tripl posit 244 tripl neg 10 hormon receptor posit among patient cn0 diseas 913 2123 apcr 632 91144 cn1 patient downstag ypn0 179 739 cn2 downstag cn0 combin her2posit tripleposit group 962 5153 patient bpcr apcr pre nact clinic nodal stage er her2 neu statu predict apcr sensit 740 ci 95 specif 690 ci 95 studi suggest her2posit tripleposit patient cn0 cn1 convert cn0 potenti candid deescal axillari surgeri
cancer,"Bayesian network (BN) models are graphical structures called the directed acyclic graphs, which model the probabilistic dependencies between variables. In the context of predictive modeling, BN models can intuitively represent the collective contribution of factors in predicting an outcome variable. This study is aimed at developing a BN model in predicting the two-year mortality of patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity (OCSCC). The secondary data for the study was obtained from a published cohort study conducted within the institute after ethical approval. The strength of association of the potential prognostic factors with the outcome variable was determined using multiple logistic regression. The hybrid BN model based on expert opinion and association matrix (BN-H) was developed. The conditional dependencies between the variables were incorporated as the thickness of edges between nodes. Multiple logistic regression (MLR) and BN models based on tree augmented (TAN), expectation maximization (EM), and gradient boosting (GB) method was developed for comparison. Gini coefficient, sensitivity, specificity, misclassification rate, and area under the ROC curve were estimated in both training and testing data for comparison. Age, smoking, alcohol, stage of the cancer, and treatment modality were found be significant prognostic factors for mortality. The association matrix determined that there were significant inter-dependencies between variables. The BN-H model was found to have a comparable predictive accuracy to the MLR model. Bayesian network model developed with expert opinion and appropriate association matrix can be an alternative to existing predictive models for binary outcome.

cancer,"Anastomotic leakage (AL) is a major complications following Low Anterior Resection (LAR) for rectal cancer. Identifying risk factors is critical to improving surgical outcomes. This retrospective study analyzed 230 patients with rectal cancer who underwent LAR following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) between 2016 and 2024. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, surgical factors, and postoperative outcomes were examined. Chi-square and t-tests identified significant variables, which were further analyzed using logistic regression. ROC curve analysis determined cutoff values, sensitivity, and specificity for significant predictors. Anastomotic leakage was observed in 18 patients (7.8%). BMI was significantly higher in the AL group (27.89 +/- 3.69) compared to the non-AL group (25.67 +/- 3.54, p = 0.012). Operative duration was also longer in patients with AL (243.69 +/- 86.89 min vs. 192.37 +/- 72.4 min, p = 0.005). Logistic regression identified BMI (OR: 1.164, 95% CI: 1.018-1.330, p = 0.027) and operative duration (OR: 1.006, 95% CI: 1.001-1.012, p = 0.018) as independent predictors of AL. ROC analysis showed a BMI cutoff of 27.77 (sensitivity 61.1%, specificity 75.9%) and an operative time cutoff of 175 min (sensitivity 88.9%, specificity 43.4%).

cancer,"Cancer diagnostic probe stations (CDP) are expensive, and they are better used in patients with suspicious findings in initial mammography. For the first time, this study investigated the compatibility of suspicious findings observed in mammograms of patients before surgery with CDP findings based on pathology findings as the gold standard. This prospective study was conducted on 26 patients with breast cancer candidates for conservative surgery with suspicious findings in the initial mammography, who were referred to our institute between April 2024 and September 2024. Ultrasound and mammography findings before surgery, frozen findings, CDP during surgery, and pathology results of patients were collected using a checklist. A breast fellowship and a radiologist, with the guidance of the positions and hourly codes of the Quadrants of Breasts, classified the position of suspicious findings in CDP and mammography. The concordance rate between the two methods was evaluated with the Kappa coefficient. Based on mammography findings, 9 (36.4%) suspicious findings were observed in the lateral, 8 (30.8%) in the medial, and 5 (19.2%) in the interior of the breast. These results were confirmed in the CDP findings. Based on the pathology findings, 7 cases of lesions were of invasive type (4 IDC and 3 ILC), while the frozen results were free in all cases. The degree of concordance and correlation between mammography and CDP findings was 96.2%. Mammography findings were almost completely consistent with intraoperative CDP findings. Suppose there are suspicious findings in the mammography of patients who are candidates for conservative breast surgery. In that case, CDP can be used intraoperatively for these slight distortions of the surrounding tumor tissue to reduce recurrence and cost and increase patient survival.",cancer diagnost probe station cdp expens better use patient suspici find initi mammographi first time studi investig compat suspici find observ mammogram patient surgeri cdp find base patholog find gold standard prospect studi conduct 26 patient breast cancer candid conserv surgeri suspici find initi mammographi refer institut april 2024 septemb 2024 ultrasound mammographi find surgeri frozen find cdp surgeri patholog result patient collect use checklist breast fellowship radiologist guidanc posit hourli code quadrant breast classifi posit suspici find cdp mammographi concord rate two method evalu kappa coeffici base mammographi find 9 364 suspici find observ later 8 308 medial 5 192 interior breast result confirm cdp find base patholog find 7 case lesion invas type 4 idc 3 ilc frozen result free case degre concord correl mammographi cdp find 962 mammographi find almost complet consist intraop cdp find suppos suspici find mammographi patient candid conserv breast surgeri case cdp use intraop slight distort surround tumor tissu reduc recurr cost increas patient surviv
cancer,"The last 25 years have seen considerable changes in cancer epidemiology in India. Numerous studies have shown increases in certain cancers, such as lifestyle and tobacco-related cancers, with decreases in other cancers, such as cervical cancer. Despite the development of the National Cancer Registry Program in 1964, cancer is not a notifiable disease in India, and there remains no comprehensive cancer registry with data relying on regional and hospital-based registries. This retrospective study aimed to elucidate the trends in cancer epidemiology in the West Bengal region over a period of 25 years (1996-2020). Our analysis includes retrospective data from the hospital electronic records of a tertiary cancer institution in Kolkata which serves patients from Kolkata as well as Eastern, North-Eastern India and Bangladesh. We collected data from 189,485 patients (of which 135,578 had malignant disease) who were diagnosed during this time. Data was visualised using Microsoft Excel and analysed using linear trend analyses and the Mann-Kendall test. We saw significant increases in breast cancers amongst females and oral cavity cancers amongst males, consistent with other studies across various regions of India. In contrast, we identified significant decreases in the frequency of cervical cancers amongst females and cancers of the ear, nose and throat regions amongst males. We report that the cancer epidemiology in West Bengal is generally following that of the rest of India. Our study has revealed important trends in cancer frequency in West Bengal and has illustrated important areas for targeting preventative and/or screening interventions.

cancer,"Pulmonary metastases from uterine cancer are rare, and clinical significance of pulmonary metastasectomy (PM) in such cases remains unclear due to limited data. We retrospectively reviewed 10 female patients who underwent PM for metastatic uterine cancer between 2010 and 2023. Clinical and pathological data, including disease-free interval (DFI), number and size of metastatic lesions, and overall survival (OS), were analyzed. Univariate analysis was performed to identify the prognostic factors. The median age of patients at the time of PM was 63 years. The primary tumor originated from the uterine body in seven cases and from the cervix in three cases. Histological subtypes included endometrioid adenocarcinoma (n = 6), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 3), and serous carcinoma (n = 1). Eight patients had a single metastasis and two had multiple lesions. The median DFI was 16 months and the median OS following PM was 96 months.

Tumor size >/= 12 mm showed a trend toward improved survival (p = 0.0529). PM was beneficial for histological confirmation in patients with uncertain preoperative diagnosis. In all 10 cases, imaging could not distinguish pulmonary metastasis from primary lung carcinoma. Thus, histopathological examination after PM was essential for final diagnosis.

cancer,"To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival(OS) among patients diagnosed with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer (PSROC) and undergoing secondary cytoreduction with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. We did a 1:1 propensity score-matched analysis (PSM) on retrospectively collected data of all patients with PSROC patients treated at our center from January 2014 to December 2020. Patients were categorized into chemotherapy with secondary cytoreductive surgery (SCH) and chemotherapy alone (CH). PSM was done with baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazard model was used to compare survivals between the matched cohorts. We identified 96 patients (SCH, N = 29; CH, N = 67). After matching, there were 58 patients (29 in each group). SCH patients had better OS and PFS compared to CH in the matched cohort [median OS 40.27 versus 23.17 months (p = 0.002) and median PFS was 26.5 versus 8.6 months (p < 0.001)] respectively. In univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, treatment modality (SCH vs. CH alone) at recurrence was the only significant factor for both OS and PFS. Our series had no perioperative mortality, and the morbidity was manageable. In patients with PSROC, chemotherapy with secondary cytoreductive surgery resulted in better OS and PFS than chemotherapy alone, with acceptable perioperative morbidity and no perioperative mortality.",compar progressionfre surviv pf overal survivalo among patient diagnos platinumsensit recurr ovarian cancer psroc undergo secondari cytoreduct chemotherapi versu chemotherapi alon 11 propens scorematch analysi psm retrospect collect data patient psroc patient treat center januari 2014 decemb 2020 patient categor chemotherapi secondari cytoreduct surgeri sch chemotherapi alon ch psm done baselin characterist cox proport hazard model use compar surviv match cohort identifi 96 patient sch n 29 ch n 67 match 58 patient 29 group sch patient better os pf compar ch match cohort median os 4027 versu 2317 month p 0002 median pf 265 versu 86 month p 0001 respect univari multivari cox regress analysi treatment modal sch vs ch alon recurr signific factor os pf seri periop mortal morbid manag patient psroc chemotherapi secondari cytoreduct surgeri result better os pf chemotherapi alon accept periop morbid periop mortal
cancer,"Thyroid cancer is globally increasing, but it is rare and more aggressive in males. This study is aimed at preliminarily evaluating the effectiveness of the transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy vestibular approach (TOETVA) in the treatment of thyroid cancer in male patients. A prospective study was conducted on 42 male thyroid cancer patients treated with TOETVA from January 2019 to December 2023 at Hanoi Medical University Hospital. All the patients enrolled had tumors < 2 cm in diameter, no extrathyroidal extension, and cN0 status. Surgical and oncologic outcomes were analyzed. The mean patient age was 30.2 (17-56) years, with 85.7% having solitary tumors, mostly in the left lobe (54.8%). Papillary thyroid carcinoma (95.2%) was the predominant diagnosis. An mean tumor size was 8.5 mm. Lobectomies comprised 95.2% of surgeries. The mean operative time was 83.3 (60-150) min, and blood loss was minimal 6.3 (5-15) ml. Postoperative complications included transient hoarseness (4.8%) and mouth-opening difficulty (2.4%), with no permanent severe hypocalcemia or hoarseness. No cases of completion thyroidectomy or conversion to open surgery due to TOETVA failure were recorded. On average, 3 (0-12) lymph nodes were harvested, with a median of 2 (0-8) malignant nodes. Most tumors were T1 (95.2%), and pN1a was observed in 52.4% of the cases. Patient satisfaction with cosmetic results was universally high. TOETVA is a safe and effective option for male patients with early-stage thyroid cancer, offering minimal complications and excellent cosmetic results.

While conventional mastectomy and the Grisotti flap technique remain options, alternative approaches such as reverse batwing and perforator-based flaps offer additional possibilities for breast conservation. The Grisotti flap, despite its utility, has limitations, particularly in non-ptotic breasts, where it may lead to lateral fullness and suboptimal cosmesis. In this report, we describe the ""Reverse Bay of Bengal"" modification of the Grisotti flap, designed to address these limitations by preserving chest wall perforators and avoiding excessive lateral bulging. This technique offers an alternative for patients with centrally located tumors requiring nipple-areola complex (NAC) excision.",central quadrant breast cancer pose signific oncoplast challeng convent mastectomi grisotti flap techniqu remain option altern approach revers batw perforatorbas flap offer addit possibl breast conserv grisotti flap despit util limit particularli nonptot breast may lead later full suboptim cosmesi report describ revers bay bengal modif grisotti flap design address limit preserv chest wall perfor avoid excess later bulg techniqu offer altern patient central locat tumor requir nippleareola complex nac excis
cancer,"Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) for peritoneal malignancies is conventional performed employing a large incision from the xiphisternum to the pubis. Recent publications have suggested a minimally invasive approach to achieve similar outcomes in patients with limited peritoneal cancer spread. This manuscript reports the results of a consensus exercise that aimed to provide recommendations on minimally invasive cytoreductive surgery (MI-CRS) for which evidence is limited. The consensus was carried out using the modified Delphi technique. There were 23 questions on two main topics: staging laparoscopy and minimal invasive cytoreductive surgery. A total of 56/62 invited surgeons agreed to vote on the consensus. A consensus was achieved if any option received > 70% of votes, and a strong consensus was set at > 90%. In rounds I and II both, 50/56 (89.28%) panellists voted. Overall, a consensus was achieved on 18/23 (78.2%) questions (strong consensus on 17.3%). The panel strongly recommended that MI-CRS should not be performed if there is incomplete evaluation during the staging laparoscopy. The panel considered PCI > 10, previous extensive abdominal surgery, large intraabdominal masses, gross diaphragmatic involvement and multi-focal mesenteric disease as contraindications to MI-CRS. There was no consensus obtained on the technique of HIPEC after MI-CRS and on performing MI-CRS in high-grade tumours and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanced ovarian cancer. This consensus laid down recommendations for technical aspects of staging laparoscopy and patient selection and technical aspects of MI-CRS. The results should spur more collaborative studies across the world to address key questions related to MI-CRS.

cancer,"The impact of visceral obesity on perioperative outcome in laparoscopic colorectal surgery is still inconclusive. Various studies have taken different parameters to define visceral obesity. The aim of our study was to find the impact of visceral fat volume (VFV) on perioperative outcome in laparoscopic colorectal surgery. The primary objective of our study was to find the correlation of VFV within postoperative complications. Sixty-five patients with colorectal cancer who underwent elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery were included in the study. We assessed the VFV from a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis using FUJIFILM: SYNAPSE 3D software. Patients were divided as per percentiles into three groups < 25th: low; 25th-75th moderate and > 75th High VFV. Intraoperative difficulties were assessed based on the surgeon's subjective scoring of difficulty, operative time, estimated blood loss, and conversion to open surgery. Postoperative outcomes were measured in terms of time to start an oral semisolid diet, length of hospital stay, surgical site infections, and overall 30-day morbidity according to the Clavien Dindo classification. Data was analysed to identify the effect of visceral fat volume on perioperative outcomes in laparoscopic colorectal surgeries. The overall rate of major complications (i.e. > grade II Clavien Dindo) was 21.5%. Moderate and high VFV groups had 28.12% and 31.25% major complications, respectively. The correlation of VFV with major complications was found to be significant with p 0.04. Overall operative time was 252.24 min, 289.31 min, and 301.44 min in low, moderate, and high VFV groups, respectively (p-value of < 0.005). High VFV had statistically significant blood loss measured as haemoglobin mass loss of 88.84 gm as compared to 44.5 gm and 57.19 gm in low and moderate. Subjective scores of difficulty were also higher in high VFV as compared to moderate and low VFV groups but higher VFV had no direct relation with conversion to open surgery. VFV had no direct effect on post-operative time to start a semi-solid diet and length of hospital stay. High VFV had a higher inflammatory response postoperatively measured as a higher CRP value but was not statistically significant.

Over the years it has undergone several modifications but has still retained its status as the most popular scoring system for prostate. Using a systematic literature review, we aim to highlight the changes the Gleason scoring has undergone, their strengths and limitations as well the future directives. Gleason scoring underwent major changes from its original conception in the International Society of Urologic Pathology (ISUP) consensus meetings held in 2005, 2014 and 2019. The latest change in Gleason scoring makes it possible to report the scoring, help alleviate patient anxiety and has shown good reproducibility and less inter-user variability. Gleason scoring system is a popular tool among pathologists and clinicians alike owing to its flexibility, utility and dependability.

cancer,"Cervical cancer is a preventable gynecological malignancy, yet it remains a significant health burden in developing countries. Hence, biomarkers identified in cervical cancer have significance in understanding the prognosis and reducing cervical cancer-related deaths. Elevated levels of Claspin, a key protein in checkpoint signaling and increased replication, have been seen in multiple solid tumors. The study included 80 cases with primary diagnosis of SCC cervix along with 10 cases of HSIL and 10 cases of cervical tissue with normal histological features. Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against P16 and claspin. Association of Claspin with P16 and clinicopathological parameters of carcinoma cervix was analyzed using chi-square test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered substantially significant. The average age of cervical carcinoma diagnosis in this study was 55 years, with a significant majority (73.75%) being post-menopausal. The study found block positivity for P16 in 83.75% of cases, indicating HPV-associated SCC. Claspin is a potential biomarker, highly expressed in SCC cervix (88.75%, p < 0.005), significantly higher than HSIL (50%) and normal tissue (0%). Increased Claspin expression was linked to P16 positivity but was not statistically significant. Claspin expression showed a significant association with postmenopausal status and presence of ulceroproliferative growth but not with other clinicopathological parameters such as age, parity, clinical findings, lymph node status, size of tumor, stage, grade, and TILs. This study has shown an increased expression of Claspin in cervical cancer. Drugs targeting Claspin has the potential to increase sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs like cisplatin.",cervic cancer prevent gynecolog malign yet remain signific health burden develop countri henc biomark identifi cervic cancer signific understand prognosi reduc cervic cancerrel death elev level claspin key protein checkpoint signal increas replic seen multipl solid tumor studi includ 80 case primari diagnosi scc cervix along 10 case hsil 10 case cervic tissu normal histolog featur immunohistochemistri perform use antibodi p16 claspin associ claspin p16 clinicopatholog paramet carcinoma cervix analyz use chisquar test p valu less 005 consid substanti signific averag age cervic carcinoma diagnosi studi 55 year signific major 7375 postmenopaus studi found block posit p16 8375 case indic hpvassoci scc claspin potenti biomark highli express scc cervix 8875 p 0005 significantli higher hsil 50 normal tissu 0 increas claspin express link p16 posit statist signific claspin express show signific associ postmenopaus statu presenc ulceroprolif growth clinicopatholog paramet age pariti clinic find lymph node statu size tumor stage grade til studi shown increas express claspin cervic cancer drug target claspin potenti increas sensit chemotherapeut drug like cisplatin
cancer,"Surgical complications are graded using various systems, with the Clavien-Dindo classification (CDC) being the most widely used due to its simplicity and ease of replication. The Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) was recently introduced to overcome the shortcomings of the CDC. This study aims to compare the Clavien-Dindo classification and the Comprehensive Complication Index in assessing post-operative complications. After elective surgery for Gastrointestinal malignancies, post-operative complications were recorded using the CDC and CCI scoring systems. CCI was calculated from free online software (https://www.cci-calculator.com). Using Pearson and Spearman correlations, both scores were correlated with the ICU stay and hospital stay. Between August 2021 and April 2023, 141 patients were included. The median number of complications per patient was 3 (range 1 to 10). The median CCI score was 39.3 (12.2 to 100). The median postoperative hospital stay was 8 days (range, 4-54 days). The median length of ICU stay was 1 day (range, 0-22 days). Using the Pearson and Spearman correlations, there was a strong correlation between both the CDC and CCI with the duration of hospital stay (correlation coefficient, 0.706 vs. 0.731, p < 0.001) and ICU stay (0.768 vs. 0.755, p < 0.001). The Comprehensive Complication Index and the Clavien-Dindo classification highly correlate with the length of hospital stay and ICU stay, with the CCI score having an edge in correlating better with hospital stay. Due to its dynamicity, the CCI score may be a better tool to depict postoperative complications in morbidity meetings and publishing literature.",surgic complic grade use variou system claviendindo classif cdc wide use due simplic eas replic comprehens complic index cci recent introduc overcom shortcom cdc studi aim compar claviendindo classif comprehens complic index assess postop complic elect surgeri gastrointestin malign postop complic record use cdc cci score system cci calcul free onlin softwar httpswwwccicalculatorcom use pearson spearman correl score correl icu stay hospit stay august 2021 april 2023 141 patient includ median number complic per patient 3 rang 1 10 median cci score 393 122 100 median postop hospit stay 8 day rang 454 day median length icu stay 1 day rang 022 day use pearson spearman correl strong correl cdc cci durat hospit stay correl coeffici 0706 vs 0731 p 0001 icu stay 0768 vs 0755 p 0001 comprehens complic index claviendindo classif highli correl length hospit stay icu stay cci score edg correl better hospit stay due dynam cci score may better tool depict postop complic morbid meet publish literatur
cancer,"Early detection and standardized management of breast cancer through triple assessment have significantly reduced mortality in developed nations. However, the adherence to these practices remains suboptimal in many resource-limited settings, with little data on primary management quality and referral practices. We retrospectively analyzed the records of 105 breast cancer patients referred to our tertiary care centre between January 2023 and December 2024, after undergoing primary evaluation and surgery at secondary care facilities. None of the patients underwent bilateral mammography or core needle biopsy, despite clear indications. Ninety-six patients had lumpectomy based solely on fine needle aspiration cytology, without axillary staging. Post-lumpectomy, all patients were referred for chemotherapy, regardless of further surgical indications. Documentation of primary surgery was often inadequate, leaving gaps in critical treatment details. Our findings reveal a significant divergence from standard breast cancer management protocols at secondary care facilities. Such non-adherence to recommended diagnostic assessments and surgical staging compromises patient outcomes. Addressing these gaps requires targeted education for secondary care physicians, infrastructural upgrades, and systemic reforms to ensure adherence to evidence-based guidelines. Bridging these gaps is essential to improve breast cancer outcomes in resource-constrained settings.",earli detect standard manag breast cancer tripl assess significantli reduc mortal develop nation howev adher practic remain suboptim mani resourcelimit set littl data primari manag qualiti referr practic retrospect analyz record 105 breast cancer patient refer tertiari care centr januari 2023 decemb 2024 undergo primari evalu surgeri secondari care facil none patient underw bilater mammographi core needl biopsi despit clear indic ninetysix patient lumpectomi base sole fine needl aspir cytolog without axillari stage postlumpectomi patient refer chemotherapi regardless surgic indic document primari surgeri often inadequ leav gap critic treatment detail find reveal signific diverg standard breast cancer manag protocol secondari care facil nonadher recommend diagnost assess surgic stage compromis patient outcom address gap requir target educ secondari care physician infrastructur upgrad system reform ensur adher evidencebas guidelin bridg gap essenti improv breast cancer outcom resourceconstrain set

cancer,"The shame and stigma scale was developed to specifically analyze the shame and stigma in head and neck cancer patients. However, being a numerical rating scale, it gives a continuous number for each patient, which is difficult for clinicians to interpret. The present study aimed to classify the numerical rating score of the shame and stigma scale into the discrete categories of normal, mild, moderate, and severe. Data from 197 patients with head and neck cancer was obtained using the shame and stigma scale. The shame and stigma scale has a global score and four domains, with a high score representing a high rate of shame and stigma. The numerical score was used to create classification schemes to derive the optimum cutoff points for discrete categories. The variability of the optimal classification scheme was quantified using a bootstrap resampling procedure by repeating the patient sample a thousand times. The classification scheme with the highest F value in ANOVA was used to assign a cutoff to classify the numerical score into normal, mild, moderate, and severe categories. Seven classification schemes were created for global score, appearance domain and stigma domain. Five classification schemes were created for the regret domain, and three classification schemes were created for the speech domain. The optimum cutoff values for global score were 0-10 (normal), 11-30 (mild), 31-50 (moderate) and 51-80 (severe) (F = 1044.105); cutoff values for appearance domain were 0-6 (normal), 7-14 (mild), 15-22 (moderate) and 23-32 (severe) (F = 1344.50); cutoff values for stigma domain were 0-2 (normal), 3-7 (mild), 8-12 (moderate) and 13-20 (severe) (F = 1590.94); cutoff values for regret domain were 0-2 (normal), 3-6 (mild), 7-10 (moderate) and 11-16 (severe) (F = 924.03); and cutoff values for speech domain were 0-2 (normal), 3-5 (mild), 6-8 (moderate) and 9-12 (severe) (F = 1008.38). The present study classifies the numerical rating score of the shame and stigma scale into discrete categories i.e. normal, mild, moderate, and severe by obtaining the optimum cutoff points as per maximum F value.

BC remains a complex and multifaceted disease that poses a significant threat and is a public health concern. Region-specific molecular subtyping is required with the updating trends of the disease. The study was conducted retrospectively at the Central Reference Laboratory, inDNA Life Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, from January 2021 to December 2023. A total of 301 BC patients were recruited in the study from multiple institutions in a consecutive manner across West-Bengal and Odisha. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (version 8.3.0) software. The study included 294 (97.6%) women and 7 (2.3%) men. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) was the most common histopathologic type observed in 90.2% (n = 267) of patients. Majority of them were diagnosed in the 4th to 6th decade of their life (n = 173; 58.45%) with a mean age of 50.8 years. ER + expression was detected in 104 (35.1%) and PR + in 87 (29.4%) cases. HER-2/neu overexpression was observed in 89 (30.1%) cases. A striking 39.8% (n = 118) triple-negative or basal-like status was noted in the cohort. Immunohistochemistry-based classification remains the gold-standard method for sub-typing of BC. The study highlights alarming numbers of TNBC cases and is the most prevalent sub-group in the 40-60 years age-group of eastern-Indian BC cases in comparison with region-specific incidence. Additionally, concurrent use of HER2/neu FISH on equivocal cases revealed a HER2/neu positivity conversion rate of 28%. Apart from studying the routine histo-molecular attributes, BRCA-based genetic screening needs to be brought into the mainstream testing for all clinically diagnosed BC cases.

The GLOBOCAN 2022 database includes seven types of head and neck cancers, including the lip and oral cavity, hypopharynx, nasopharynx, oropharynx, salivary gland, larynx, and thyroid cancer. These categories are made according to the International Classification of Diseases Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) based on anatomical location of tumor. The data was extracted for the prevalence, incidence, and mortality rate. The incidence rate trend was analyzed for 15 years, from 2003 to 2017. The estimated rise in the incidence rate was predicted until 2050. The highest prevalence was reported for lip and oral cavity cancer which was 26.31, 17.07, and 6.4 for the 5 years, 3 years, and 1 year per 100,000 individuals respectively. The age-standardized rate (ASR) and crude incidence rate were highest for the lip and oral cavity cancers (9.91 and 10.22 respectively). The incidence rate of larynx and thyroid cancer remains stabilized over 15 years from year 2003 to 2017. The percent risk of rise of new cancer cases by the year 2050 is maximum for oropharynx cancer (103.9%). GLOBOCAN is one of most compressive global cancer databases which provides important insight regarding cancer across 185 countries. Head and neck cancer in India was found to impose a high prevalence, incidence, and mortality rate. Healthcare agencies need to derive an action plan to reduce the rising risk of head and neck cancer in India.",head neck cancer one common cancer worldwid exhibit continu rise trend preval incid rate across globe head neck cancer found preval develop nation like india respons signific cancerrel mortal rate aim analyz preval incid mortal trend head neck cancer india per latest global cancer observatori globocan 2022 estim produc intern agenc research cancer iarc dissemin cancer today globocan websit globocan 2022 databas includ seven type head neck cancer includ lip oral caviti hypopharynx nasopharynx oropharynx salivari gland larynx thyroid cancer categori made accord intern classif diseas relat health problem 10th revis icd10 base anatom locat tumor data extract preval incid mortal rate incid rate trend analyz 15 year 2003 2017 estim rise incid rate predict 2050 highest preval report lip oral caviti cancer 2631 1707 64 5 year 3 year 1 year per 100000 individu respect agestandard rate asr crude incid rate highest lip oral caviti cancer 991 1022 respect incid rate larynx thyroid cancer remain stabil 15 year year 2003 2017 percent risk rise new cancer case year 2050 maximum oropharynx cancer 1039 globocan one compress global cancer databas provid import insight regard cancer across 185 countri head neck cancer india found impos high preval incid mortal rate healthcar agenc need deriv action plan reduc rise risk head neck cancer india
cancer,"Over the past four decades, gynecologic oncology has grown significantly as an academic discipline. In its early stages, only a handful of cancer centers offered certified training programs, providing a basic orientation to the field but lacking comprehensive, in-depth training. The discipline has become more structured today by establishing fellowship and degree programs at various tertiary-level cancer centers nationwide. However, training quality and depth still vary considerably across institutions. This nationwide survey was conducted to evaluate the strengths of current training programs and identify areas for improvement based on feedback from current trainees and early-career gynecologic oncologists. An online survey questionnaire was disseminated to a targeted group via WhatsApp messaging, adhering to specific inclusion criteria, and remained open from September 15, 2023, to November 16, 2023. The respondents comprised Gynecologic Oncology trainees enrolled in Master of Chirurgiae (MCh) or Doctorate of National Board (DrNB) programs, second-year fellows, and Gynecologic Oncologists who had completed their training within the past two years. The survey consisted of 57 questions designed to assess various aspects of training, academic activities, and expectations from the program. It also aimed to evaluate the overall exposure of trainees, focusing on the frequency and range of surgeries they participated in and their satisfaction with the surgical training. The collected responses were systematically tabulated and analyzed to derive meaningful insights. Out of 107 responses, 99 were analyzed. The findings indicated satisfactory exposure to the overall curriculum and a wide range of clinical conditions. A significant proportion (72.9%) of participants reported active involvement in open surgeries, including extensive procedures such as peritonectomy and sentinel node techniques, and receiving feedback on academic performance. However, concerns were highlighted regarding insufficient exposure to minimally invasive surgery, particularly robotic techniques, as well as specialized procedures like Heated Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) and ultra-radical surgeries. This comprehensive survey, the largest of its kind among Gynecologic Oncology trainees in India, sheds light on the strengths (""hits"") and areas for improvement (""misses"") within the current training curriculum. Key ""hits"" include satisfactory exposure to open surgeries and feedback mechanisms, alongside the adoption of techniques like peritonectomy and sentinel node procedures. However, the ""misses,"" such as limited training in minimally invasive surgery-especially robotics-and specialized procedures like Heated Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) and ultra-radical surgeries, underscore further enhancement. This study serves as a valuable reference for evaluating and refining training programs. It provides a framework for future audits to standardize and elevate the quality of gynecologic oncology training in India.

cancer,"The global cancer burden is expected to rise over the next few decades, with an equally significant increase in the need for cancer surgical services. It is well known that gross inequities exist in accessing cancer surgical care on the global stage. The goal of this manuscript is to highlight the inequities in accessing cancer surgical care and outline some strategies to address them. We used GLOBOCAN 2022 to document the current and predicted rise in the future cancer burden for the various income groups, as defined by the World Bank Group. Data from relevant agencies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), World Bank Group, and relevant publications were used to quantify current and future workforce (surgical and relevant other health professions) needs, number of imaging modalities, hospital capacity, and healthcare expenditure per capita. Our study demonstrates that there are extreme variations in cancer burden on the global stage as well as inequities in all domains of cancer surgical care pathways, based on income status. Low-income (LICs) and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) will experience a proportionally larger increase in cancer burden over the next few decades. At the same time, LICs and LMICs were noted to have severe shortages in all elements of the cancer surgical care pathways ranging from the number of cancer surgeons and other oncology professionals, hospital beds, and imaging modalities, when compared to high-income countries (HICs). Health care expenditure per capita also demonstrated variations with the highest rates noted in the HICs. This study highlights the inequities in access to cancer surgical care on the global stage. To address these challenges, we have proposed some strategies derived from the 2023 Lancet Oncology Commission on Global Cancer Surgery report, which can realistically be accomplished in a timeframe of 5-15 years.",global cancer burden expect rise next decad equal signific increas need cancer surgic servic well known gross inequ exist access cancer surgic care global stage goal manuscript highlight inequ access cancer surgic care outlin strategi address use globocan 2022 document current predict rise futur cancer burden variou incom group defin world bank group data relev agenc intern atom energi agenc iaea world bank group relev public use quantifi current futur workforc surgic relev health profess need number imag modal hospit capac healthcar expenditur per capita studi demonstr extrem variat cancer burden global stage well inequ domain cancer surgic care pathway base incom statu lowincom lic lowermiddleincom countri lmic experi proport larger increas cancer burden next decad time lic lmic note sever shortag element cancer surgic care pathway rang number cancer surgeon oncolog profession hospit bed imag modal compar highincom countri hic health care expenditur per capita also demonstr variat highest rate note hic studi highlight inequ access cancer surgic care global stage address challeng propos strategi deriv 2023 lancet oncolog commiss global cancer surgeri report realist accomplish timefram 515 year
cancer,"To assess the role of contrast enhanced mammography (CEM) as compared to conventional digital mammography (DM) in pre-operative evaluation for multifocal/multicentric breast carcinoma (BC). This prospective study was done on 35 females after obtaining approval from the institute ethics committee. DM and CEM were performed in standard craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) positions and the findings were recorded as per the 5th edition of ACR-BIRADS lexicon. The findings included background parenchymal density and enhancement; presence of mass (size, shape, margin, density, enhancement features); presence of any satellite lesions or additional lesions on DM/CEM and its enhancement characteristics; any non-mass enhancement and associated findings. Sampling of the additional findings was done for equivocal radiology. The mean age was 45 years (26-76 years) and the mean size of index lesion was 3.44 cm (+ / - 1.25 cm) on DM. Presence of intraductal extension was seen in 5 patients (14.3%) on DM, whereas CEM could delineate it in 11 patients (31.4%). In addition, CEM showed better detection rate of multifocal disease (42.9% vs 65.7%), multicentric disease (17.1% vs 31.4%), and synchronous breast lesion (2.9% vs 5.7%). The accuracy and precision of tumour size measurement, multifocality and multicentricity were higher with CEM as compared to DM. Therefore, CEM may be a good alternative modality to assess the multifocality, multicentricity and disease extent in the preoperative setting and for those with limited access or contraindication to MRI.",assess role contrast enhanc mammographi cem compar convent digit mammographi dm preoper evalu multifocalmulticentr breast carcinoma bc prospect studi done 35 femal obtain approv institut ethic committe dm cem perform standard craniocaud cc mediolater obliqu mlo posit find record per 5th edit acrbirad lexicon find includ background parenchym densiti enhanc presenc mass size shape margin densiti enhanc featur presenc satellit lesion addit lesion dmcem enhanc characterist nonmass enhanc associ find sampl addit find done equivoc radiolog mean age 45 year 2676 year mean size index lesion 344 cm 125 cm dm presenc intraduct extens seen 5 patient 143 dm wherea cem could delin 11 patient 314 addit cem show better detect rate multifoc diseas 429 vs 657 multicentr diseas 171 vs 314 synchron breast lesion 29 vs 57 accuraci precis tumour size measur multifoc multicentr higher cem compar dm therefor cem may good altern modal assess multifoc multicentr diseas extent preoper set limit access contraind mri
cancer,"Treatment for colorectal cancer has improved significantly over the last few decades. The feasibility of treating colorectal cancer recurrence is also increasing. The surveillance protocol applied influences the pattern of diagnosis of recurrence. Adherence to intense follow up protocols may be challenged by limitation of resource, pointing to the scope of forming tailored strategies. The objectives were to determine the rate of salvage, disease-free and overall survival, the types of local therapy applied, morbidity associated with radical local treatment, and the factors influencing survival of patients followed up using a low intensity regimen after curative treatment for recurrent colorectal cancer. We included patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer recurrence from January 2010 to December 2016 at the institute. The clinicopathological and treatment details were collected. Treatment outcomes were analyzed and compared with the baseline characteristics. Of 109 recurrences, 26 (23.8%) were offered curative therapy. Locoregional treatment modalities consisted of four cases of pelvic exenteration (18.2%), four (18.2%) resections of peritoneal deposits including two (9.1%) multivisceral resections, four (18.2%) hepatic resections, two (9.1%) lung metastasectomies, one (4.5%) retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, and two (4.5%) ablative procedures. Four (18.2%) and one (4.5%) cases received chemoradiotherapy and systemic therapy alone. Surgical resection had 6.2% Clavien-Dindo grade III, 25% grade II, and 25% grade I morbidities. With a median follow-up of 95 months, the median DFS and OS were 48 months and 55 months for curatively treated patients. The rate of curative therapy was low in a low-intensity follow-up regimen (23.8%). Yet, curative treatment including complex resections offers a survival advantage with acceptable morbidity rates, in select patients with limited disease affecting a single region.",treatment colorect cancer improv significantli last decad feasibl treat colorect cancer recurr also increas surveil protocol appli influenc pattern diagnosi recurr adher intens follow protocol may challeng limit resourc point scope form tailor strategi object determin rate salvag diseasefre overal surviv type local therapi appli morbid associ radic local treatment factor influenc surviv patient follow use low intens regimen cur treatment recurr colorect cancer includ patient diagnos colorect cancer recurr januari 2010 decemb 2016 institut clinicopatholog treatment detail collect treatment outcom analyz compar baselin characterist 109 recurr 26 238 offer cur therapi locoregion treatment modal consist four case pelvic exenter 182 four 182 resect periton deposit includ two 91 multiviscer resect four 182 hepat resect two 91 lung metastasectomi one 45 retroperiton lymph node dissect two 45 abl procedur four 182 one 45 case receiv chemoradiotherapi system therapi alon surgic resect 62 claviendindo grade iii 25 grade ii 25 grade morbid median followup 95 month median df os 48 month 55 month cur treat patient rate cur therapi low lowintens followup regimen 238 yet cur treatment includ complex resect offer surviv advantag accept morbid rate select patient limit diseas affect singl region

This study was conducted with the ethical approval of the ethics committee and has also received the ICMR STS grant. Data of 138 patients who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer in the last 5 years were analyzed for a history of cholecystectomy. Those who developed colorectal cancer within a year of their cholecystectomy were excluded from the study to minimize protopathic bias. The control group was composed of healthy individuals. Data extracted was organized in Microsoft Excel and was analyzed about the main objective. Chi-square test was used to find the association between cholecystectomy and colorectal cancer. RESULTS: The percentage of cholecystectomy in the colorectal cancer group was 6.5% vs 2.1% in the control group (P value = 0.072). There were no statistically significant associations between diabetes, hypertension, CKD, alcohol intake or smoking, and the incidence of colorectal cancer.

cancer,"Mortality in patients with gastric cancer (GC) remains high. Therefore, accurate postoperative staging is particularly important for follow-up/treatment and prognostic fate of these patients. In this single-centre study, we analysed retrospective data from 170 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed GC who underwent radical resection. The objective of this observational, retrospective cohort study was, therefore, to evaluate prognostic value of the positive-to-total lymph node ratio (PLNR) and log odds of positive lymph nodes (LODDS), in addition to known predictors of survival, such as TNM staging, grading and histopathological subtypes of GC. All clinically relevant variables (including patient demographics) were initially assessed evaluated as candidate predictors of overall survival (OS) in univariable regression analysis. The final prognostic model for overall mortality included five clinical factors predictive of OS. PLNR was statistically significant associated with 3-year survival (Cramer's V = 0.429, eta(2) = 0.178; p < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex and disease stage, PLNR remained an independent predictor of mortality (p = 0.016; OR 1.230; 95% CI 1.039-1.455). We have found that the increased PLNR is associated with poor 3-year survival in patients with GC who underwent radical/curative resection. Inclusion of PLNR produced a model of better fit and increased its predictive power for the survival outcome of GC patients.",mortal patient gastric cancer gc remain high therefor accur postop stage particularli import followuptreat prognost fate patient singlecentr studi analys retrospect data 170 consecut patient histolog confirm gc underw radic resect object observ retrospect cohort studi therefor evalu prognost valu positivetotot lymph node ratio plnr log odd posit lymph node lodd addit known predictor surviv tnm stage grade histopatholog subtyp gc clinic relev variabl includ patient demograph initi assess evalu candid predictor overal surviv os univari regress analysi final prognost model overal mortal includ five clinic factor predict os plnr statist signific associ 3year surviv cramer v 0429 eta2 0178 p 0001 adjust age sex diseas stage plnr remain independ predictor mortal p 0016 1230 95 ci 10391455 found increas plnr associ poor 3year surviv patient gc underw radicalcur resect inclus plnr produc model better fit increas predict power surviv outcom gc patient
cancer,"Staging of positive axilla that showed negativity after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is a subject of controversy. In this situation, sentinel node biopsy is debatable due to high false negative rates. This study evaluates the feasibility of axillary targeted surgery after lymph node charcoal tattooing for clinically positive nodes prior to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. This study included 30 cases of breast cancer with clinically suspicious axillary nodes who were planned for neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. They underwent fine needle biopsy from the suspicious node with simultaneous injection of carbon suspension. After therapy, those who showed negativity on repeat ultrasound had exploration with excision of the tattooed and the sentinel node. Axillary lymph node dissection was performed if any of both was pathologically involved. A total of 30 patients were carbon-labelled before systemic therapy. Twenty-one were included in the final analysis, while 9 patients were excluded. Carbon-tattooed lymph node was in 28/30 patients (93.3%). In patients who had targeted dissection, the charcoaled and sentinel nodes were the same in 19/21 patients (90.4%), and in this group, 15/21 patients had positive targeted dissection, and we proceeded to axillary dissection in 4 patients who showed positive nodes. Targeted LN was not the sentinel node in two patients; in both, all nodes were negative. Carbon tattooing of axillary lymph nodes provides a safe, cheap, and reliable alternative to marker clips without the need for image guidance to locate the marked node which provides an excellent alternative in low-resource countries with the advantage of durable tissue staining.",stage posit axilla show neg neoadjuv chemotherapi subject controversi situat sentinel node biopsi debat due high fals neg rate studi evalu feasibl axillari target surgeri lymph node charcoal tattoo clinic posit node prior neoadjuv chemotherapi studi includ 30 case breast cancer clinic suspici axillari node plan neoadjuv chemotherapi underw fine needl biopsi suspici node simultan inject carbon suspens therapi show neg repeat ultrasound explor excis tattoo sentinel node axillari lymph node dissect perform patholog involv total 30 patient carbonlabel system therapi twentyon includ final analysi 9 patient exclud carbontattoo lymph node 2830 patient 933 patient target dissect charcoal sentinel node 1921 patient 904 group 1521 patient posit target dissect proceed axillari dissect 4 patient show posit node target ln sentinel node two patient node neg carbon tattoo axillari lymph node provid safe cheap reliabl altern marker clip without need imag guidanc locat mark node provid excel altern lowresourc countri advantag durabl tissu stain
cancer,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatic cancer both represent prostate lesions affecting males. These conditions occur due to the presence of inflammation within the prostate gland. This inflammatory process causes tissue injury and cellular modifications, which are primarily through the cytokine synthesis and secretion. Distinctly, IL-6 (interleukin 6) emerges as a vital part in prostate disease, exerting a profound influence on its development. In addition, the anti-inflammatory cytokines' inclusion, such as tumor necrosis factor beta-1 (TGFbeta-1), is evident in the development of both benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic cancer. In recent discoveries, researchers are more focused on complex interaction between IL-6 and TGFbeta-1 in the prostate pathophysiology. The article aims to assess the IL-6 and TGFbeta-1 immunohistochemical expression in prostatic benign and malignant lesions. Formalin-fixed samples that were encapsulated in paraffin were utilized in this work. They were collected from the department of histopathology et al.-Ramadi-Teaching Hospital from patients who were diagnosed with hyperplasia and carcinoma of the prostate. To detect the expression of TGFbeta-1 and IL-6, immunohistochemical analysis was performed on the tissue sections. The intensity of stromal staining was determined to assess the stromal expression. Concerning prostate cancer, the relationship between cytokine expression and the Gleason index score was discussed in this work. The results confirm that the TGFbeta-1 was presented in the epithelial and stromal components of prostate tissue with a higher concentration in the stroma. The TGFbeta-1 stromal expression was increased in cases of benign hyperplastic changes in comparison to prostate carcinoma (p < 0.05). On the contrary, the epithelial expression of TGFbeta-1 did not show any significant differences between the two cases. On the other hand, IL-6 expression was localized in the epithelial component, with higher levels observed in prostate cancer in comparison to hyperplasia. There was no substantial correlation found between the Gleason score and IL-6 expression. According to our results, the immunohistochemical detection of both TGFbeta-1 and IL-6 exhibited variations between benign and malignant samples.",benign prostat hyperplasia bph prostat cancer repres prostat lesion affect male condit occur due presenc inflamm within prostat gland inflammatori process caus tissu injuri cellular modif primarili cytokin synthesi secret distinctli il6 interleukin 6 emerg vital part prostat diseas exert profound influenc develop addit antiinflammatori cytokin inclus tumor necrosi factor beta1 tgfbeta1 evid develop benign prostat hyperplasia prostat cancer recent discoveri research focus complex interact il6 tgfbeta1 prostat pathophysiolog articl aim assess il6 tgfbeta1 immunohistochem express prostat benign malign lesion formalinfix sampl encapsul paraffin util work collect depart histopatholog et alramaditeach hospit patient diagnos hyperplasia carcinoma prostat detect express tgfbeta1 il6 immunohistochem analysi perform tissu section intens stromal stain determin assess stromal express concern prostat cancer relationship cytokin express gleason index score discuss work result confirm tgfbeta1 present epitheli stromal compon prostat tissu higher concentr stroma tgfbeta1 stromal express increas case benign hyperplast chang comparison prostat carcinoma p 005 contrari epitheli express tgfbeta1 show signific differ two case hand il6 express local epitheli compon higher level observ prostat cancer comparison hyperplasia substanti correl found gleason score il6 express accord result immunohistochem detect tgfbeta1 il6 exhibit variat benign malign sampl
cancer,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the mainstay in the management of metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). There is a concern regarding the cardiovascular effects of ADT. Despite a reported incidence of major adverse cardiac event (MACE) in up to 6%, some Asian studies show no significant change. We aimed to find the cardiovascular effects of ADT in Indian men with PCa. In this prospective cohort study, men who underwent treatment for PCa from January 2022 to January 2023 were included. The ADT arm comprised patients with locally advanced and metastatic PCa who received ADT. The control arm included localized PCa patients who underwent radical prostatectomy without any ADT treatment. The primary outcomes were the incidence of MACE, changes in the Framingham risk score (FRS), ECG, and echocardiography at 1 year. Secondary outcomes were changes in the body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio, lipid profile, glycaemic parameters, and ankle brachial pressure index at 1 year. Forty cases and 23 controls were analyzed. There were three (7.5%) MACE in the ADT group at 1 year with no events in the control group. The ADT group had a significant increase in the mean FRS (2.54 +/- 4.45 vs 0.67 +/- 2.13; p = 0.021), weight (2.83 +/- 2.97 vs. 0.94 +/- 1.8 kg; p = 0.004), BMI (0.9 +/- 1.08 vs. 0.32 +/- 0.66 kg/m(2); p = 0.016), and HbA1c (0.54 +/- 1.64 vs. 0.18 +/- 1.08%; p = 0.023) compared to controls. A total of 7.5% of patients who received ADT developed MACE at 1 year. FRS, BMI, and HbA1c increased with ADT.

cancer,"The oral tongue is a common location for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and behaves more aggressively. Lymph node yield(LNY) is a robust independent prognostic factor in oral SCC. In this study, we attempt to determine the prognostic significance of LNY per neck node level for oral tongue SCC. This retrospective observational study includes 302 patients with oral tongue SCC who were operated in our unit between 2017 and 2022. Relevant data were collected, and patients followed up for at least 24 months. LNY per level was calculated and correlated with recurrence and overall survival. A total of 344 neck dissections were performed on 302 patients. On average, 36 nodes (36.05 +/- 15.02) were harvested per neck dissection. The maximum yield was found in level IIa, 6.72 (6-10), irrespective of pathological node positivity. On multivariate analysis, a higher LNY at level IIa significantly correlated with recurrence, along with other factors. We found that LNY of 10 or more nodes from level II might be a more sensitive predictor of recurrence than overall LNY per neck dissection. This could be because level II nodes receive a majority of lymphatic drainage from the oral tongue. Total LNY may be impacted by yield at other levels and may lull the surgeon into a false sense of security, when clearance of the most crucial nodal basin at level II remains suboptimal.

cancer,"Traditionally considered to function solely as signaling molecules within the central nervous system (CNS), neurotransmitters are now recognized as key regulators of systemic homeostasis. They modulate interactions among the nervous, immune, and metabolic systems and influence the development of various diseases. This review systematically summarizes the fundamental properties of major neurotransmitters, including their biosynthesis, receptor subtypes, and key signaling pathways, and analyzes their context-dependent roles in cancer, neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), and inflammatory disorders. A primary focus is the three-dimensional regulatory principle that determines their effects, namely: the receptor type they bind to, cellular microenvironment, and stage of the disease. These factors explain the bidirectional effects of neurotransmitters in disease. This review also evaluates current therapeutic approaches targeting neurotransmitter pathways, ranging from receptor-specific drugs to emerging combination therapies, and discusses challenges in clinical translation, such as off-target effects of nonspecific drugs and variable efficacy across disease types. By linking the fundamental mechanisms of neurotransmitter function to clinical challenges, this review provides a comprehensive framework for exploiting the neurotransmitter-immune axis to develop precise therapeutic strategies aimed at improving outcomes in cancer, NDDs, and inflammatory disorders.",tradit consid function sole signal molecul within central nervou system cn neurotransmitt recogn key regul system homeostasi modul interact among nervou immun metabol system influenc develop variou diseas review systemat summar fundament properti major neurotransmitt includ biosynthesi receptor subtyp key signal pathway analyz contextdepend role cancer neurodegen diseas ndd inflammatori disord primari focu threedimension regulatori principl determin effect name receptor type bind cellular microenviron stage diseas factor explain bidirect effect neurotransmitt diseas review also evalu current therapeut approach target neurotransmitt pathway rang receptorspecif drug emerg combin therapi discuss challeng clinic translat offtarget effect nonspecif drug variabl efficaci across diseas type link fundament mechan neurotransmitt function clinic challeng review provid comprehens framework exploit neurotransmitterimmun axi develop precis therapeut strategi aim improv outcom cancer ndd inflammatori disord
cancer,"Cellular plasticity, the ability of cells to dynamically alter their phenotypes, is a key driver of tumor evolution. This process is a hallmark of cancer which enables the acquisition of malignant traits, leading to metastasis, progression, and therapy resistance. It is governed by cell-intrinsic factors, such as genomic instability and epigenetic reprogramming, and extrinsic stimuli from the tumor microenvironment. However, a unified framework is still needed to position plasticity as the central process that links these drivers to diverse cancer hallmarks. In this review, we first explore how plasticity enables key steps of tumor evolution, including tumorigenesis, metastasis driven by epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP), therapy resistance, and cancer stem cell (CSC) dynamics. We then summarize the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that govern this adaptability. Finally, we discuss clinical advances in monitoring and targeting plasticity and highlight how new spatiotemporal technologies can address current research challenges. This review provides a framework positioning cellular plasticity as a central mechanism in cancer evolution, connecting its fundamental drivers to clinical translation. By synthesizing the latest advances, we offer perspectives for developing therapies that integrate prediction, monitoring, and targeting of plasticity to proactively guide cancer evolution toward manageable outcomes.",cellular plastic abil cell dynam alter phenotyp key driver tumor evolut process hallmark cancer enabl acquisit malign trait lead metastasi progress therapi resist govern cellintrins factor genom instabl epigenet reprogram extrins stimuli tumor microenviron howev unifi framework still need posit plastic central process link driver divers cancer hallmark review first explor plastic enabl key step tumor evolut includ tumorigenesi metastasi driven epithelialmesenchym plastic emp therapi resist cancer stem cell csc dynam summar intrins extrins mechan govern adapt final discuss clinic advanc monitor target plastic highlight new spatiotempor technolog address current research challeng review provid framework posit cellular plastic central mechan cancer evolut connect fundament driver clinic translat synthes latest advanc offer perspect develop therapi integr predict monitor target plastic proactiv guid cancer evolut toward manag outcom
cancer,"Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of illness and death worldwide, and in Qatar, their burden is rising due to rapid urbanization, shifts toward Westernized diets, sedentary lifestyles, and cultural influences. Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021, this study examined the NCD burden in Qatar, including the burden of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, neurological conditions, and mental health disorders attributable to dietary risks, low physical activity, smoking, and high body-mass index (BMI). In 2021, lifestyle-related risk factors were responsible for 64.8% of NCD deaths and 33.2% of DALYs in Qatar. High BMI emerged as the top contributor, accounting for 24.5% of deaths and 13.9% of DALYs, followed by poor diet and smoking. The burden of high BMI-related NCDs increased over the past 30 years, with a 71.4% increase in deaths and a 54.3% rise in DALYs, while the impact of smoking declined. Compared to other Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Qatar had a higher NCD burden, particularly for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes linked to obesity.

Using dual-energy X-rays and iodinated contrast agents, CEM highlights enhancing abnormalities and is highly sensitive in detecting malignancies, particularly in dense breasts. Its advantages include rapid image acquisition and cost-effectiveness, making it useful in screening, diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of chemotherapy response. Emerging applications of radiomics and artificial intelligence are poised to improve lesion characterization and predict molecular subtypes. While promising, CEM also has limitations, including increased radiation exposure, risks associated with contrast, potential for false results, and difficulty in widespread integration because of the limited availability of CEM-guided biopsy. Overall, CEM is a valuable and cost-effective tool with increased clinical relevance.

cancer,"PURPOSE: To compare the diagnostic performance between biparametric MRI (bpMRI) and multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) using split dynamic MRI for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) with Prostate Imaging and Reporting Data System (PI-RADS) v2.1, using prostatectomy as the reference standard of pathologic analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 77 PCa cases in 60 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for biopsy-proven prostate cancer. The MR Images of the prostate were interpreted in consensus by two experienced radiologists (aged 3 and 35 years). We retrospectively reviewed the MRI images according to PI-RADS v2.1 and recorded the scores from T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging, and peak relaxation rate (R2(*)) for each lesion at three different time points: 1) bpMRI (T2WI, DWI, and ADC), 2) mpMRI1 (T2WI, DWI, ADC, and DCE), and 3) mpMRI2 (T2WI, DWI, ADC, DCE, and peak R2(*)). The diagnostic performances of bpMRI, mpMRI1, and mpMRI2 in detecting csPCa using PI-RADS V2.1 were evaluated. Additionally, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of DCE-MRI and peak R2(*) for csPCa detection. RESULTS: The area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for diagnosing csPCa with PI-RADS v2.1 in all lesions and peripheral zone (PZ) lesions were not significantly different between the bpMRI, mpMRI1, and mpMRI2 protocols (p > 0.05). DCE-MRI was better than the peak R2(*) for diagnosing csPCa in PZ lesions (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: mpMRI using split dynamic MRI has diagnostic performance similar to that of bpMRI for detecting csPCa using PI-RADS v2.1.",purpos compar diagnost perform biparametr mri bpmri multiparametr mri mpmri use split dynam mri detect clinic signific prostat cancer cspca prostat imag report data system pirad v21 use prostatectomi refer standard patholog analysi materi method retrospect analyz 77 pca case 60 patient underw radic prostatectomi biopsyproven prostat cancer mr imag prostat interpret consensu two experienc radiologist age 3 35 year retrospect review mri imag accord pirad v21 record score t2weight imag t2wi diffusionweight imag dwi dynam contrastenhanc dce imag peak relax rate r2 lesion three differ time point 1 bpmri t2wi dwi adc 2 mpmri1 t2wi dwi adc dce 3 mpmri2 t2wi dwi adc dce peak r2 diagnost perform bpmri mpmri1 mpmri2 detect cspca use pirad v21 evalu addit evalu diagnost perform dcemri peak r2 cspca detect result area curv sensit specif accuraci diagnos cspca pirad v21 lesion peripher zone pz lesion significantli differ bpmri mpmri1 mpmri2 protocol p 005 dcemri better peak r2 diagnos cspca pz lesion p 0001 conclus mpmri use split dynam mri diagnost perform similar bpmri detect cspca use pirad v21
cancer,"Since the introduction of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS), prostate MRI has become an essential tool for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer, determining tumor stage, and guiding targeted biopsy. However, variability in image quality across institutions continues to affect diagnostic accuracy. To address this issue, the Prostate Imaging Quality (PI-QUAL) scoring system was developed as a standardized framework for evaluating the quality of prostate MRI. PI-QUAL v1 established the first quality control system for multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) but had limitations, including the inability to assess biparametric MRI (bpMRI) and a strong reliance on biopsy correlation. The updated PI-QUAL v2 simplified technical requirements, incorporated bpMRI assessment, and introduced a reproducible 3-point scale with adjustment rules that balance quality assurance with the diagnostic advantages of mpMRI. Factors influencing image quality include magnetic field strength and susceptibility- and motion-related artifacts. Complementary approaches, such as the Prostate Signal Intensity Homogeneity Score and artificial intelligence-based evaluation tools, have also been proposed. Overall, PI-QUAL v2 enhances reproducibility and broadens clinical applicability, providing a practical framework for ensuring high-quality prostate MRI.

cancer,"Biochemical recurrence, marked by rising prostate specific antigen levels, is a common and challenging clinical scenario following curative treatments for localized prostate cancer (PCa), such as radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT). An accurate assessment is critical for detecting local recurrence and distinguishing it from distant metastatic disease, thereby guiding salvage therapies. While multiparametric MRI has demonstrated strong performance in detecting local recurrence, the lack of standardized reporting has historically limited its clinical utility and reproducibility. To address this variability, an international consensus-based Prostate Imaging for Recurrence Reporting (PI-RR) system was introduced in 2021. PI-RR adopts a 5-point Likert scale, similar to Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System, but places greater emphasis on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and incorporates knowledge of the prior primary tumor location to grade the likelihood of recurrence. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of the PI-RR system, detailing its imaging acquisition recommendations, specific scoring criteria after RT and RP, clinical implications, and future directions within the evolving landscape of PCa imaging.",biochem recurr mark rise prostat specif antigen level common challeng clinic scenario follow cur treatment local prostat cancer pca radic prostatectomi rp radiat therapi rt accur assess critic detect local recurr distinguish distant metastat diseas therebi guid salvag therapi multiparametr mri demonstr strong perform detect local recurr lack standard report histor limit clinic util reproduc address variabl intern consensusbas prostat imag recurr report pirr system introduc 2021 pirr adopt 5point likert scale similar prostat imag report data system place greater emphasi dynam contrastenhanc mri incorpor knowledg prior primari tumor locat grade likelihood recurr review articl provid comprehens overview pirr system detail imag acquisit recommend specif score criteria rt rp clinic implic futur direct within evolv landscap pca imag
cancer,"The rising detection of low-risk localized prostate cancer has established active surveillance (AS) as a standard management approach; however, reliance on repeated biopsies poses procedural risks and patient burden. Multiparametric MRI offers a noninvasive alternative for monitoring disease progression, yet the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System has limited capacity in interpreting longitudinal changes. To address this gap, the Prostate Cancer Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation (PRECISE) framework was developed to standardize the reporting of serial MRI changes using a 5-point scale, thereby enhancing interpretive consistency, facilitating multidisciplinary communication, and informing timely intervention. The 2024 PRECISE v2 update incorporated standardized imaging quality assessment, refined subcategories for stable disease, quantified progression criteria, and clarified comparison standards, enabling more personalized follow-up strategies. This review synthesizes the development, core features, and clinical implications of PRECISE v1 and v2, highlighting their potential to advance MRI reporting standardization and risk-adapted management in AS for prostate cancer, while outlining key areas for future research.",rise detect lowrisk local prostat cancer establish activ surveil standard manag approach howev relianc repeat biopsi pose procedur risk patient burden multiparametr mri offer noninvas altern monitor diseas progress yet prostat imag report data system limit capac interpret longitudin chang address gap prostat cancer radiolog estim chang sequenti evalu precis framework develop standard report serial mri chang use 5point scale therebi enhanc interpret consist facilit multidisciplinari commun inform time intervent 2024 precis v2 updat incorpor standard imag qualiti assess refin subcategori stabl diseas quantifi progress criteria clarifi comparison standard enabl person followup strategi review synthes develop core featur clinic implic precis v1 v2 highlight potenti advanc mri report standard riskadapt manag prostat cancer outlin key area futur research

cancer,"We studied the structural alterations between healthy and diseased brain tissues using a multiparametric framework combining fractal analysis, fractal functional transformation, multifractal analysis, and the Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR) analysis. Accurate characterization of brain tissue microstructure is crucial for early detection and diagnosis of cancer. By applying box-counting methods on brightfield microscopy images, we estimated the fractal dimension (Df) and its logarithmic (ln(Df)) and functional (ln(Dtf)) forms to highlight spatial irregularities in the tissue architecture. While Df and ln(Df) exhibited long-tailed distributions distinguishing healthy from cancer tissues, ln(Dtf) provided significantly improved differentiation by emphasizing local structural variations. Additionally, multifractal analysis revealed broader f(alpha) vs alpha curves in cancerous samples, reflecting higher heterogeneity. IPR analysis based on light localization further demonstrated increased nanoscale variations in mass density, reflecting higher structural disorder in cancer tissues. Combining these complementary approaches creates a robust framework for measuring tissue complexity and holds great potential to improve microscopic diagnostic methods for brain cancer detection.",studi structur alter healthi diseas brain tissu use multiparametr framework combin fractal analysi fractal function transform multifract analysi invers particip ratio ipr analysi accur character brain tissu microstructur crucial earli detect diagnosi cancer appli boxcount method brightfield microscopi imag estim fractal dimens df logarithm lndf function lndtf form highlight spatial irregular tissu architectur df lndf exhibit longtail distribut distinguish healthi cancer tissu lndtf provid significantli improv differenti emphas local structur variat addit multifract analysi reveal broader falpha vs alpha curv cancer sampl reflect higher heterogen ipr analysi base light local demonstr increas nanoscal variat mass densiti reflect higher structur disord cancer tissu combin complementari approach creat robust framework measur tissu complex hold great potenti improv microscop diagnost method brain cancer detect
cancer,"Personalized neoantigen vaccines represent a promising immunotherapy approach that harnesses tumor-specific antigens to stimulate anti-tumor immune responses. However, the design of these vaccines requires sophisticated computational workflows to predict and prioritize neoantigen candidates from patient sequencing data, coupled with rigorous review to ensure candidate quality. While numerous computational tools exist for neoantigen prediction, to our knowledge, there are no established protocols detailing the complete process from raw sequencing data through systematic candidate selection. Here, we present ImmunoNX (Immunogenomics Neoantigen eXplorer), an end-to-end protocol for neoantigen prediction and vaccine design that has supported over 185 patients across 11 clinical trials. The workflow integrates tumor DNA/RNA and matched normal DNA sequencing data through a computational pipeline built with Workflow Definition Language (WDL) and executed via Cromwell on Google Cloud Platform. ImmunoNX employs consensus-based variant calling, in-silico HLA typing, and pVACtools for neoantigen prediction. Additionally, we describe a two-stage immunogenomics review process with prioritization of neoantigen candidates, enabled by pVACview, followed by manual assessment of variants using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). This workflow enables vaccine design in under three months. We demonstrate the protocol using the HCC1395 breast cancer cell line dataset, identifying 78 high-confidence neoantigen candidates from 322 initial predictions. Although demonstrated here for vaccine development, this workflow can be adapted for diverse neoantigen therapies and experiments. Therefore, this protocol provides the research community with a reproducible, version-controlled framework for designing personalized neoantigen vaccines, supported by detailed documentation, example datasets, and open-source code.",person neoantigen vaccin repres promis immunotherapi approach har tumorspecif antigen stimul antitumor immun respons howev design vaccin requir sophist comput workflow predict priorit neoantigen candid patient sequenc data coupl rigor review ensur candid qualiti numer comput tool exist neoantigen predict knowledg establish protocol detail complet process raw sequenc data systemat candid select present immunonx immunogenom neoantigen explor endtoend protocol neoantigen predict vaccin design support 185 patient across 11 clinic trial workflow integr tumor dnarna match normal dna sequenc data comput pipelin built workflow definit languag wdl execut via cromwel googl cloud platform immunonx employ consensusbas variant call insilico hla type pvactool neoantigen predict addit describ twostag immunogenom review process priorit neoantigen candid enabl pvacview follow manual assess variant use integr genom viewer igv workflow enabl vaccin design three month demonstr protocol use hcc1395 breast cancer cell line dataset identifi 78 highconfid neoantigen candid 322 initi predict although demonstr vaccin develop workflow adapt divers neoantigen therapi experi therefor protocol provid research commun reproduc versioncontrol framework design person neoantigen vaccin support detail document exampl dataset opensourc code
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Breast reconstruction after mastectomy improves quality of life for breast cancer patients. As more late-stage patients undergo reconstruction, it is essential to understand how treatment regimens and radiation impact outcomes. This study compared early- and late-stage breast cancer patients, examining comorbidities, reconstructive details, complications, and satisfaction. METHODS: A total of 989 patients (903 early-stage; 86 late-stage) who underwent breast reconstruction between January 2011 and February 2025 were reviewed. Cancer staging followed the National Cancer Institute definitions: early-stage (I-IIIA) and late-stage (IIIB-IV). RESULTS: Late-stage patients had higher rates of diabetes (P = 0.003), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P < 0.001), and radiation (P < 0.001), whereas early-stage patients more often received adjuvant hormonal therapy (P = 0.006). Hormone receptor profiles differed: late-stage patients were more likely to be human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (P < 0.001), whereas early-stage patients were estrogen receptor-positive (P < 0.001) and progesterone receptor-positive (P = 0.004). Early-stage patients more often underwent 2-stage expander reconstruction (P = 0.002) and implant-based reconstruction (P = 0.039), whereas late-stage patients more frequently had delayed reconstruction (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in implant, flap, or donor-site complications, or in BREAST-Q satisfaction scores. CONCLUSIONS: Breast reconstruction is feasible and safe in late-stage breast cancer patients. Despite greater comorbidities and more aggressive disease, late-stage patients achieve complication rates and satisfaction comparable to early-stage patients. Future research should refine protocols to address the specific needs of late-stage patients, emphasizing quality of life and patient-centered outcomes.",background breast reconstruct mastectomi improv qualiti life breast cancer patient latestag patient undergo reconstruct essenti understand treatment regimen radiat impact outcom studi compar earli latestag breast cancer patient examin comorbid reconstruct detail complic satisfact method total 989 patient 903 earlystag 86 latestag underw breast reconstruct januari 2011 februari 2025 review cancer stage follow nation cancer institut definit earlystag iiiia latestag iiibiv result latestag patient higher rate diabet p 0003 neoadjuv chemotherapi p 0001 radiat p 0001 wherea earlystag patient often receiv adjuv hormon therapi p 0006 hormon receptor profil differ latestag patient like human epiderm growth factor receptor 2posit p 0001 wherea earlystag patient estrogen receptorposit p 0001 progesteron receptorposit p 0004 earlystag patient often underw 2stage expand reconstruct p 0002 implantbas reconstruct p 0039 wherea latestag patient frequent delay reconstruct p 0001 signific differ implant flap donorsit complic breastq satisfact score conclus breast reconstruct feasibl safe latestag breast cancer patient despit greater comorbid aggress diseas latestag patient achiev complic rate satisfact compar earlystag patient futur research refin protocol address specif need latestag patient emphas qualiti life patientcent outcom
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Darolutamide, a novel androgen receptor inhibitor, significantly improved outcomes in the ARASENS trial when combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and docetaxel chemotherapy for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). In China, the regimen has been reimbursed since December 2023, expanding real-world accessibility. PSMA imaging-guided focal therapy enables precise localization of residual or oligometastatic lesions and may complement systemic control. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the real-world efficacy and safety of darolutamide-based triplet therapy combined with PSMA imaging-guided focal treatment in patients with mHSPC. METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective study included 17 patients treated across three tertiary hospitals between June 2023 and June 2024. All patients received darolutamide (600 mg twice daily), ADT, and docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks for 4-6 cycles), followed 4-6 weeks later by focal therapy (surgery or radiotherapy) based on multidisciplinary team (MDT) assessment and PSMA IMAGING findings. Data collection followed STROBE recommendations. The primary endpoint was PSA90 response; secondary endpoints included PSA </=0.2 ng/mL, PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), radiographic PFS (rPFS), and safety. RESULTS: Seventeen patients with predominantly low- to intermediate-volume metastatic disease were analyzed. The PSA90 response rate was 94.1%, and 82.4% achieved PSA </=0.2 ng/mL. Median PSA-PFS and rPFS were not reached at a median follow-up of 16 months. The 12-/18-month PSA-PFS rates were 88% and 65%, while the corresponding rPFS rates were 94% and 76%. Grade 1-2 myelosuppression (64.7%) and fatigue (47.1%) were most common; grade 3 neutropenia occurred in two patients (11.8%) without grade >/=4 events. Focal therapy was well tolerated, with no severe complications. CONCLUSION: Darolutamide-based triplet therapy combined with PSMA-guided focal intervention achieved deep biochemical responses and durable disease control with manageable toxicity in real-world Chinese patients with mHSPC.

cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Although farrerol exhibits promising antitumor properties against various cancers, its potential therapeutic effects on colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unexplored, and the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Based on network pharmacology, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and in vitro experiments, this study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms of farrerol in the treatment of CRC, thereby providing new research directions for CRC therapy. METHODS: This study employed network pharmacology to screen for potential therapeutic targets and pathways of farrerol in CRC, followed by preliminary validation of target validity through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, in vitro experiments were conducted to verify the antitumor effects of farrerol against CRC. RESULTS: Network pharmacology identified 12 key targets: CCNA1, CCNA2, CCNE1, CDC25B, CDK2, CYP19A1, ESR1, ESR2, HSP90AA1, PTPN1, RAF1, and SRC. The molecular docking results revealed that the binding energies of farrerol with all target proteins were as follows: farrerol-CCNA1 (-8.6 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-CCNA2 (-7.0 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-CCNE1 (-7.4 kcal.mol(1)), farrerol-CDC25B (-7.3 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-CDK2 (-10.1 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-CYP19A1 (-8.4 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-ESR1 (-3.3 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-ESR2 (-8.9 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-HSP90AA1 (-10.4 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-PTPN1 (-7.6 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-RAF1 (-4.5 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-SRC (-9.9 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-VEGFA (-8.5 kcal.mol(-1)), and farrerol-KDR (-9.0 kcal.mol(-1)). These data indicate that farrerol can spontaneously bind to the target proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated favorable interactions within the KDR-Farrerol and VEGFA-Farrerol complexes. In vitro experimental results demonstrated that farrerol could inhibit the proliferation and migration of CRC cells, induce cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, and suppress the protein expression of VEGFA, VEGFR2, and p-VEGFR2. CONCLUSION: This study, for the first time, validated the antitumor effect of farrerol against CRC through network pharmacology, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and in vitro experiments. The findings indicate that the ability of farrerol to inhibit the proliferation and migration of colorectal cancer cells may be associated with the induction of G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest and the regulation of VEGF signaling pathway activation via binding to VEGFA and KDR.",object although farrerol exhibit promis antitumor properti variou cancer potenti therapeut effect colorect cancer crc remain unexplor underli mechan still unclear base network pharmacolog molecular dock molecular dynam simul vitro experi studi aim investig molecular mechan farrerol treatment crc therebi provid new research direct crc therapi method studi employ network pharmacolog screen potenti therapeut target pathway farrerol crc follow preliminari valid target valid molecular dock molecular dynam simul final vitro experi conduct verifi antitumor effect farrerol crc result network pharmacolog identifi 12 key target ccna1 ccna2 ccne1 cdc25b cdk2 cyp19a1 esr1 esr2 hsp90aa1 ptpn1 raf1 src molecular dock result reveal bind energi farrerol target protein follow farrerolccna1 86 kcalmol1 farrerolccna2 70 kcalmol1 farrerolccne1 74 kcalmol1 farrerolcdc25b 73 kcalmol1 farrerolcdk2 101 kcalmol1 farrerolcyp19a1 84 kcalmol1 farrerolesr1 33 kcalmol1 farrerolesr2 89 kcalmol1 farrerolhsp90aa1 104 kcalmol1 farrerolptpn1 76 kcalmol1 farrerolraf1 45 kcalmol1 farrerolsrc 99 kcalmol1 farrerolvegfa 85 kcalmol1 farrerolkdr 90 kcalmol1 data indic farrerol spontan bind target protein molecular dynam simul demonstr favor interact within kdrfarrerol vegfafarrerol complex vitro experiment result demonstr farrerol could inhibit prolifer migrat crc cell induc cell cycl arrest g0g1 phase suppress protein express vegfa vegfr2 pvegfr2 conclus studi first time valid antitumor effect farrerol crc network pharmacolog molecular dock molecular dynam simul vitro experi find indic abil farrerol inhibit prolifer migrat colorect cancer cell may associ induct g0g1 phase cell cycl arrest regul vegf signal pathway activ via bind vegfa kdr
cancer,"Common kidney diseases include acute kidney injury, diabetic kidney disease, kidney cancer, and other related conditions. Ginsenosides, the principal bioactive constituents of ginseng, have been widely reported as therapeutic agents against these disorders. However, recent advances regarding their efficacy in kidney diseases have not been comprehensively synthesized. This review addresses this gap by summarizing current findings on the mechanisms and therapeutic targets of ginsenosides. Literature from PubMed, Web of Science, and other databases was systematically retrieved using keywords such as ginsenosides, acute kidney injury, diabetic nephropathy, renal cell carcinoma, lupus nephritis, and aging-related kidney injury. Evidence from cell-based and animal studies demonstrates that ginsenoside compound K, Rg1, Rg3, Rh2, Rb1, Rb3, Rg2, and Rg5 are the most frequently reported for kidney protection. Mechanistically, ginsenosides modulate multiple signalling networks, including NF-kappaB, PI3K/AKT, MAPK, TGF-beta/Smads, PPAR, SIRT1, NLRP3, and Nrf2, to mitigate inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, pyroptosis, autophagy, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Taken together, these findings provide valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of ginsenosides and underscore their promise as candidates for the prevention and treatment of kidney diseases.",common kidney diseas includ acut kidney injuri diabet kidney diseas kidney cancer relat condit ginsenosid princip bioactiv constitu ginseng wide report therapeut agent disord howev recent advanc regard efficaci kidney diseas comprehens synthes review address gap summar current find mechan therapeut target ginsenosid literatur pubm web scienc databas systemat retriev use keyword ginsenosid acut kidney injuri diabet nephropathi renal cell carcinoma lupu nephriti agingrel kidney injuri evid cellbas anim studi demonstr ginsenosid compound k rg1 rg3 rh2 rb1 rb3 rg2 rg5 frequent report kidney protect mechanist ginsenosid modul multipl signal network includ nfkappab pi3kakt mapk tgfbetasmad ppar sirt1 nlrp3 nrf2 mitig inflamm oxid stress apoptosi epithelialmesenchym transit pyroptosi autophagi endoplasm reticulum stress taken togeth find provid valuabl insight therapeut potenti ginsenosid underscor promis candid prevent treatment kidney diseas
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: CD82, a metastasis suppressor, is known to be palmitoylated, yet the functional significance of this modification in drug response remains unclear. This study investigates the role of CD82 palmitoylation in modulating chemosensitivity in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. METHODS: A palmitoylation-deficient CD82 mutant (C5A/C74A/C83A) was generated and expressed in MDA -MB-231 breast cancer cells. Protein palmitoylation was assessed via acyl-biotin exchange assay. Subcellular localization was analyzed by co-immunofluorescence with early endosome (EEA1) and vesicular (VPS4A) markers. Apoptosis was evaluated by measuring levels of apoptotic markers. The cytotoxic effect of the CD82 mutation in combination with gefitinib, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and camptothecin was quantified using TUNEL and Annexin V/PI assays. RESULTS: The CD82 palmitoylation-deficient mutant exhibited reduced palmitoylation and increased colocalization with EEA1 and VPS4A. This mutation triggered intrinsic apoptosis, as evidenced by elevated levels of Caspase-3, Cleaved-caspase-3, and Cytochrome C. Strikingly, it synergistically enhanced the cytotoxicity of both gefitinib and doxorubicin, significantly increasing apoptosis in treated cells. DISCUSSION: Our findings reveal a novel role for CD82 palmitoylation in regulating drug-induced apoptosis. Disruption of palmitoylation potentiates chemotherapy-induced cell death, providing a molecular rationale for targeting CD82 palmitoylation as a combinatorial strategy to overcome therapeutic resistance in TNBC.",introduct cd82 metastasi suppressor known palmitoyl yet function signific modif drug respons remain unclear studi investig role cd82 palmitoyl modul chemosensit tripleneg breast cancer tnbc cell method palmitoylationdefici cd82 mutant c5ac74ac83a gener express mda mb231 breast cancer cell protein palmitoyl assess via acylbiotin exchang assay subcellular local analyz coimmunofluoresc earli endosom eea1 vesicular vps4a marker apoptosi evalu measur level apoptot marker cytotox effect cd82 mutat combin gefitinib doxorubicin paclitaxel camptothecin quantifi use tunel annexin vpi assay result cd82 palmitoylationdefici mutant exhibit reduc palmitoyl increas coloc eea1 vps4a mutat trigger intrins apoptosi evidenc elev level caspase3 cleavedcaspase3 cytochrom c strikingli synergist enhanc cytotox gefitinib doxorubicin significantli increas apoptosi treat cell discuss find reveal novel role cd82 palmitoyl regul druginduc apoptosi disrupt palmitoyl potenti chemotherapyinduc cell death provid molecular rational target cd82 palmitoyl combinatori strategi overcom therapeut resist tnbc
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the leading cause of cancer mortality, often requires platinum-based chemotherapy. Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) improves drug delivery, while PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors enhance antitumor immunity. Preclinical studies suggest synergy, but clinical evidence for combining these agents remains limited. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, this meta-analysis pooled data from four randomized controlled trials (1998 patients). Databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, web of science) were searched until January 2025. Trials comparing PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors + nab-paclitaxel-platinum (experimental) versus chemotherapy alone (control) were included. Outcomes included including objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), pathologic complete response (pCR), major pathologic response (MPR), and grade >/=3 adverse events (AEs). Statistical analyses used fixed/random-effects models. RESULTS: The combination therapy significantly improved ORR (OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.49-2.20, p < 0.001), PFS (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.58-0.73), and OS (HR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.91). In the resectable setting, neoadjuvant treatment resulted in higher pathologic complete response (pCR: 32.6% vs. 8.9%) and major pathologic response (MPR: 65.1% vs. 15.6%). Subgroup analyses showed enhanced benefit in PD-L1-high patients. The experimental group had increased risk of grade >/=3 thrombocytopenia (RR = 1.83) and immune-related adverse events (RR = 2.49). CONCLUSION: PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors combined with nab-paclitaxel-platinum enhance survival outcomes in NSCLC, particularly for PD-L1-high patients. Despite increased immune-related toxicity risks, this regimen represents a promising first-line option, warranting biomarker-driven selection and vigilant AE management. Future studies should address heterogeneity in platinum agents and optimize patient stratification.",background nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc lead caus cancer mortal often requir platinumbas chemotherapi nanoparticl albuminbound paclitaxel nabpaclitaxel improv drug deliveri pd1pdl1 inhibitor enhanc antitumor immun preclin studi suggest synergi clinic evid combin agent remain limit method follow prisma guidelin metaanalysi pool data four random control trial 1998 patient databas pubm embas cochran central web scienc search januari 2025 trial compar pd1pdl1 inhibitor nabpaclitaxelplatinum experiment versu chemotherapi alon control includ outcom includ includ object respons rate orr progressionfre surviv pf overal surviv os patholog complet respons pcr major patholog respons mpr grade 3 advers event ae statist analys use fixedrandomeffect model result combin therapi significantli improv orr 181 95 ci 149220 p 0001 pf hr 065 95 ci 058073 os hr 081 95 ci 072091 resect set neoadjuv treatment result higher patholog complet respons pcr 326 vs 89 major patholog respons mpr 651 vs 156 subgroup analys show enhanc benefit pdl1high patient experiment group increas risk grade 3 thrombocytopenia rr 183 immunerel advers event rr 249 conclus pd1pdl1 inhibitor combin nabpaclitaxelplatinum enhanc surviv outcom nsclc particularli pdl1high patient despit increas immunerel toxic risk regimen repres promis firstlin option warrant biomarkerdriven select vigil ae manag futur studi address heterogen platinum agent optim patient stratif
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is an aggressive malignancy that has poor survival. Management of ESCC depends on the resectability of the disease, certain patient characteristics, fitness for surgery, and the anatomic complexity of the disease location. Treatment options include either Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCR) followed by surgery or definitive Chemoradiation (DCR). While randomized trials have provided insights into both strategies, no large-scale retrospective real-world studies have been conducted to compare these approaches in diverse, unselected populations. This study assesses real-world outcomes of NCR versus DCR using the National Cancer Database (NCDB). METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the NCDB, focusing on patients with ESCC from 2004 to 2020. Propensity score matching (PSM) (1:1) was utilized. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were employed. RESULTS: N = 386 patients with esophageal cancer, with a median age of 64 years (IQR, 57.0-70.0), were identified. Patients were evenly distributed between the DCR and NCR groups, with a total of N = 193 participants. We further selected patients with ESCC, a total of N = 311 patients. NCR demonstrated a significantly extended overall survival (OS) compared to those who received DCR, with a median of 33.15 months vs. 20.5 months (P-value: 0.0069), respectively. Patients receiving DCR had significantly worse OS compared to patients receiving NCR with HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.05-1.81, p=0.0206. Patients with tumors in the thoracic esophagus (C15.3) showed significant survival benefit from surgery (p=0.0070), whereas no benefit was seen for cervical tumors (C15.0), likely due to anatomical complexity and limited sample size. CONCLUSION: NCR followed by surgery, when feasible, offers survival benefits for patients with ESCC, especially for locally advanced tumors in the thoracic esophagus.",background esophag squamou cell carcinoma escc aggress malign poor surviv manag escc depend resect diseas certain patient characterist fit surgeri anatom complex diseas locat treatment option includ either neoadjuv chemoradiotherapi ncr follow surgeri definit chemoradi dcr random trial provid insight strategi largescal retrospect realworld studi conduct compar approach divers unselect popul studi assess realworld outcom ncr versu dcr use nation cancer databas ncdb method retrospect cohort studi conduct use data ncdb focus patient escc 2004 2020 propens score match psm 11 util univari multivari cox regress analys employ result n 386 patient esophag cancer median age 64 year iqr 570700 identifi patient evenli distribut dcr ncr group total n 193 particip select patient escc total n 311 patient ncr demonstr significantli extend overal surviv os compar receiv dcr median 3315 month vs 205 month pvalu 00069 respect patient receiv dcr significantli wors os compar patient receiv ncr hr 138 95 ci 105181 p00206 patient tumor thorac esophagu c153 show signific surviv benefit surgeri p00070 wherea benefit seen cervic tumor c150 like due anatom complex limit sampl size conclus ncr follow surgeri feasibl offer surviv benefit patient escc especi local advanc tumor thorac esophagu
cancer,"PURPOSE: Over the years, immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) axes have substantially improved clinical outcomes for patients with various types of cancer and stages. As a result, PD-L1 is the most recognized biomarker used to guide the selection of patients for treatment with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. To date, there are 4 regulatory agency-approved and commercially available immunohistochemistry assays used to quantify PD-L1 tumor expression, with each assay approved for use with a specific PD-(L)1 inhibitor. In this descriptive review, we concisely summarize the methodology and scoring methods of each assay, as well as some of the challenges associated with real-world use of these assay systems. RESULTS: Each assay system is optimized for specific therapies, with its own anti-PD-L1 antibody, protocol, scoring, and interpretation guidelines. Although the methodologies of the 4 PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assay systems are similar, differences in their antibody clones, protocol conditions, instrumentation, and scoring methods limit assay interchangeability. The assays are also highly sensitive; slight deviations to the protocol can increase the risk of misclassifying the PD-(L)1 tumor status of patients. As a result, pathologists are faced with choosing which assay to perform with a limited tumor sample as well as with the challenges associated with the scoring methods and differences in regional regulatory approvals and infrastructure. CONCLUSION: While the 4 approved PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assays provide clinical value, we offer pathologists suggestions to reduce the challenges associated with PD-L1 testing based on assay systems.",purpos year immun checkpoint inhibitor target program cell death protein 1 pd1 program cell death ligand 1 pdl1 axe substanti improv clinic outcom patient variou type cancer stage result pdl1 recogn biomark use guid select patient treatment antipdl1 therapi date 4 regulatori agencyapprov commerci avail immunohistochemistri assay use quantifi pdl1 tumor express assay approv use specif pdl1 inhibitor descript review concis summar methodolog score method assay well challeng associ realworld use assay system result assay system optim specif therapi antipdl1 antibodi protocol score interpret guidelin although methodolog 4 pdl1 immunohistochemistri assay system similar differ antibodi clone protocol condit instrument score method limit assay interchang assay also highli sensit slight deviat protocol increas risk misclassifi pdl1 tumor statu patient result pathologist face choos assay perform limit tumor sampl well challeng associ score method differ region regulatori approv infrastructur conclus 4 approv pdl1 immunohistochemistri assay provid clinic valu offer pathologist suggest reduc challeng associ pdl1 test base assay system

cancer,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in patients with primary ovarian cancer (OC) following cytoreductive surgery (CRS). METHODS: Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to May 2025. The outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Treatment effects were quantified using pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). RESULTS: This meta-analysis included 10 studies [three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and seven observational studies] involving 1,668 patients. Patients with primary OC undergoing CRS who received HIPEC treatment in the experimental group demonstrated prolonged PFS (HR = 0.45, 95%CI = 0.29-0.69, p < 0.001, I (2) = 77.3%) and OS (HR = 0.59, 95%CI = 0.45-0.78, p < 0.001, I (2) = 60.6%) outcomes compared with the controls. In the experimental group, better PFS benefits were observed in Western populations, observational studies, interval cytoreductive surgery (ICS), and in patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-1. HIPEC was beneficial for patients with OC regardless of follow-up time >/=5 years (HR = 0.68, 95%CI = 0.49-0.96, p = 0.026) or <5 years (HR = 0.29, 95%CI = 0.13-0.63, p = 0.002), with a greater magnitude of benefit observed in the subgroup with follow-up <5 years. The subgroup analyses for OS revealed a consistent benefit of HIPEC across Western population, follow-up time >/=5 years, ICS, and ECOG 0-1. Benefit was associated with HIPEC in both RCT (HR = 0.75, 95%CI = 0.60-0.94, p = 0.013) and observational analyses (HR = 0.47, 95%CI = 0.33-0.68, p = 0.001), while the observed effect size was larger in the latter. Conversely, HIPEC was associated with a significant OS detriment in patients with an ECOG performance status of 2-3 (HR = 2.37, 95%CI = 1.07-5.23, p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: HIPEC appears beneficial to the prognosis of patients with primary OC following CRS, particularly after ICS. However, the administration of HIPEC in patients with ECOG 2-3 requires careful clinical consideration.

cancer,"Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in cellular protection against oxidative stress and the maintenance of redox homeostasis. In addition to modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS), Nrf2 influences lipid peroxidation (LP) and ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxide accumulation. Dysregulation of Nrf2 signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of several malignancies, where it affects tumor cell survival, chemoresistance, and metabolic reprogramming. This review summarizes current knowledge on the complex relationship between Nrf2 activity, LP dynamics, and ferroptotic mechanisms in cancer biology. It also highlights how Nrf2-dependent transcriptional programs not only regulate antioxidant responses but also contribute to cellular detoxification, metabolism, autophagy, and proteostasis, processes closely linked to tumorigenesis and cancer cell adaptability. Given that Nrf2 may have a dual role in cancer, either promoting cytoprotection or supporting tumor progression and chemoresistance, we discuss emerging strategies to selectively modulate Nrf2 and ferroptosis-related pathways to increase cancer cell sensitivity to oxidative damage and reduce resistance.",nuclear factor erythroid 2relat factor 2 nrf2 key transcript factor regul express gene involv cellular protect oxid stress mainten redox homeostasi addit modul reactiv oxygen speci ro nrf2 influenc lipid peroxid lp ferroptosi irondepend form regul cell death driven lipid peroxid accumul dysregul nrf2 signal implic pathogenesi progress sever malign affect tumor cell surviv chemoresist metabol reprogram review summar current knowledg complex relationship nrf2 activ lp dynam ferroptot mechan cancer biolog also highlight nrf2depend transcript program regul antioxid respons also contribut cellular detoxif metabol autophagi proteostasi process close link tumorigenesi cancer cell adapt given nrf2 may dual role cancer either promot cytoprotect support tumor progress chemoresist discuss emerg strategi select modul nrf2 ferroptosisrel pathway increas cancer cell sensit oxid damag reduc resist
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop 10 machine learning models based on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) radiomic features to predict epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and to identify risk factors contributing to model misclassification. METHODS: This study included 277 NSCLC patients from Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, who underwent pretreatment (18)F-FDG PET/CT and EGFR mutation testing. A PET/CT signature (PCS)-nomogram was developed by comparing 10 machine learning algorithms for EGFR prediction. Leave-one-out cross-validation generated model-specific EGFR mutation probabilities for individual patients, and performance disparities were analyzed across clinical subgroups. Model performance was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic curve, Youden's index, decision curve analysis, and DeLong's test. RESULTS: The PCS-nomogram model, constructed using the partial least squares generalized linear models (plsRglm) algorithm, achieved optimal performance in predicting EGFR mutations in NSCLC patients (training cohort: area under the curve [AUC] = 0.80; validation cohort: AUC = 0.82). Smoking history caused statistically significant performance deterioration in seven of 10 machine learning models (|DeltaYouden's index| >/= 0.1). The PCS model demonstrated higher predictive performance in never-smokers than in smokers (AUC = 0.90 vs. 0.64; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A plsRglm-based PCS-nomogram model was proposed for the noninvasive prediction of EGFR mutations in NSCLC patients.

cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly aggressive malignancy characterized by complex metabolic reprogramming, a hallmark that provides both biosynthetic precursors and signaling molecules to support tumor growth, invasion and therapeutic resistance. A key mechanism underlying this metabolic rewiring is the dynamic interplay between the host and gut microbiota. Gut microbiota derived metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids, polyamines and tryptophan derivatives, extensively reshape the CRC metabolic network and modulate the immune microenvironment, thereby influencing tumor progression and therapy response.

Non-invasive blood assays can reveal tumor-specific DNA alterations, enhancing personalized oncology. AIM: This study aims to investigate the clinical relevance of plasma-detected PIK3CA mutations in Vietnamese breast cancer patients, with a focus on subtype-specific outcomes. METHODS: PIK3CA hotspot mutations (H1047R and E545K) were detected in plasma from 196 BC patients. Associations with clinicopathological features and progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed. RESULTS: PIK3CA mutations were identified in 42.9% of patients with H1047R (31.6%) more prevalent than E545K (15.3%). Mutation rates were highest in HR+ subtypes and elevated in advanced or irradiated patients (p = 0.009). E545K was enriched in HR+ cases, while H1047R was more frequent in HER2+ tumors following radiotherapy. Among metastatic BC patients, those with PIK3CA mutations had shorter PFS (median, 7.0 vs. 15.0 months; p = 0.022), and univariate Cox regression showed increased progression risk (HR = 2.16), although not significant after multivariate adjustment. E545K was associated with lung (p = 0.047) and bone metastases (p = 0.012) and H1047R was enriched in brain metastases (p = 0.028).

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains highly lethal with five-year survival below 10%, primarily due to late diagnosis, treatment resistance, and immunosuppressive microenvironment. METHODS: This review examines recent advances in PDAC precision medicine by analyzing organoid-based drug screening platforms, mRNA immunotherapy developments, and integrated diagnostic technologies. RESULTS: Patient-derived organoids demonstrate strong predictive value for clinical outcomes, with drug sensitivity profiles correlating with patient responses (concordance >80%). Personalized mRNA neoantigen vaccines induce robust T-cell responses, with vaccine responders showing significantly prolonged recurrence-free survival (median not reached vs. 13.4 months). KRAS-targeted therapies achieve 10-15% response rates in G12C-mutant PDAC. Integration of spatial transcriptomics and liquid biopsy enables real-time molecular monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: The development of patient-derived organoids for drug sensitivity testing, personalized mRNA vaccines for immune activation, and precision diagnostic and therapeutic technologies represents complementary advances in PDAC.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer prognosis critically depends on tumor invasiveness, yet existing predictive tools lack accessibility and generalizability. We aimed to develop predictive models using comprehensive hematological profiling of routine tests to assess invasiveness and survival, improving clinical decision-making. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 512 cervical cancer patients who underwent radical surgery. A panel of hematological indices was evaluated, including inflammatory markers, coagulation parameters, and metabolic indicators. Machine learning (ML) algorithms innovatively integrated with traditional regression were employed for feature selection and model development. Models were internally validated by bootstrap methods for discrimination (AUC/C-index) and calibration. Clinical utility was assessed by decision curve analysis (DCA). Web-based Shiny applications of these models were deployed. RESULTS: Using routine hematological indices selected from ML-based methods, we identified the optimal variable set for each clinical outcome prediction model based on C-index comparisons. The multivariable analyses of these variables identified hematological parameters associated with cervical cancer progression and prognosis. TG, HGB, Eosinophil count, TCLR, and NAR acted as protective factors, while LDL, WBC, FAR, DDI, FLR, ENLR, SII and platelet count were risk factors linked to advanced disease features. In addition, Tbil and DDI were consistent risk factors for both recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). The models assessed invasiveness risk and survival risk in two critical periods: pre-surgery and post-surgery. The AUC values for predicting locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC), uterine body invasion (UBI), lymph node positivity (LNP), adjuvant therapy (ADT), parauterine invasion (PUI), and vaginal invasion (VI) were 0.714, 0.781, 0.781, 0.719, 0.756, and 0.700, respectively. For OS, the pre-surgery and post-surgery models achieved C-index of 0.875 and 0.906, while the RFS models yielded 0.790 and 0.863, respectively.

cancer,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) continue to redefine the therapeutic paradigm, their efficacy is limited to a specific proportion of patients. Radiotherapy (RT) is proposed as a strategy to enhance their efficacy, yet its clinical impact remains unclear, hindered by its double-edged sword effect on the immune system across variable settings. This review explores the landscape of RT-ICI combinations in NSCLC, analyzing available evidence in the light of current treatment guidelines. The presented data provide a foundation to validate computational models to predict clinical outcomes and inform tumor-immune dynamics. ClinicalTrials.gov was queried for trials involving both modalities, excluding studies incorporating other therapies except chemotherapy and surgery, other cancer types, or brain metastases. Of the 309 trials identified, 23 met the inclusion criteria, encompassing resectable (n=3), early-stage (n=3), locally advanced (n=10), and advanced NSCLC (n=7). In the neoadjuvant setting, the combination achieves a remarkable pathological response without significantly affecting surgical outcomes. Long-term survival benefit remains elusive. In early-stage unresectable tumors, ICIs are poised to replace chemotherapy as the preferred peri-radiation systemic treatment to prevent recurrences. Current data on locally advanced NSCLC confirm the feasibility of early ICI introduction, chemotherapy-free regimens, and individualized RT approaches. A definitive risk-benefit balance has yet to be established. In advanced stages, while the abscopal effect is well documented, statistical significance remains a concern, necessitating adequately designed studies powered to identify subpopulations most likely to benefit from the combination. Innovative, feasible approaches include RT and dual ICI, re-irradiation beyond progression, multisite micro-radiation, or partial irradiation of large tumors to activate a ""hot"" tumor microenvironment. In conclusion, while the combination of RT and ICI holds promise, significant challenges remain. A deeper understanding of immune dynamics is crucial. Additionally, the complexity of trial design, coupled with a lack of statistical significance in most available data, underscores the need for more phase 3 trials, the development of powerful biomarkers, and complementary approaches, such as virtual clinical trials, to accelerate progress and refine treatment strategies.",nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc remain lead caus cancerrel mortal worldwid immun checkpoint inhibitor ici continu redefin therapeut paradigm efficaci limit specif proport patient radiotherapi rt propos strategi enhanc efficaci yet clinic impact remain unclear hinder doubleedg sword effect immun system across variabl set review explor landscap rtici combin nsclc analyz avail evid light current treatment guidelin present data provid foundat valid comput model predict clinic outcom inform tumorimmun dynam clinicaltrialsgov queri trial involv modal exclud studi incorpor therapi except chemotherapi surgeri cancer type brain metastas 309 trial identifi 23 met inclus criteria encompass resect n3 earlystag n3 local advanc n10 advanc nsclc n7 neoadjuv set combin achiev remark patholog respons without significantli affect surgic outcom longterm surviv benefit remain elus earlystag unresect tumor ici pois replac chemotherapi prefer periradi system treatment prevent recurr current data local advanc nsclc confirm feasibl earli ici introduct chemotherapyfre regimen individu rt approach definit riskbenefit balanc yet establish advanc stage abscop effect well document statist signific remain concern necessit adequ design studi power identifi subpopul like benefit combin innov feasibl approach includ rt dual ici reirradi beyond progress multisit microradi partial irradi larg tumor activ hot tumor microenviron conclus combin rt ici hold promis signific challeng remain deeper understand immun dynam crucial addit complex trial design coupl lack statist signific avail data underscor need phase 3 trial develop power biomark complementari approach virtual clinic trial acceler progress refin treatment strategi
cancer,"Head and neck cancer (HNC) remains a pressing global health challenge, particularly in regions with lower socioeconomic status, where risk behaviors such as tobacco use and alcohol consumption are prevalent. Despite advances in treatment, reliable biomarkers for the early detection and monitoring of HNC remain lacking. The alpha-Gal carbohydrate epitope, absent in humans but present in other mammals, has garnered interest due to the natural presence of anti-alpha-Gal antibodies in the human immune repertoire, comprising approximately 1% of total circulating IgG. We investigated the role of anti-alpha-Gal IgG as a potential biomarker by performing ELISA on serum samples from a cohort of 11 patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck. Eight were older male patients, most of whom lived in rural areas and engaged in manual occupations. High rates of tobacco (81.8%) and alcohol consumption (63.6%) were observed, in line with established risk factors for HNC. These individuals showed significantly elevated anti-alpha-Gal antibody titers compared to non-cancer controls. Chemotherapy with cisplatin did not markedly affect antibody levels, suggesting consistent immune reactivity across treatment status. These results suggest that anti-alpha-Gal antibodies may serve as promising biomarker candidates in HNC and warrant further investigation to clarify their potential diagnostic and immunotherapeutic applications.",head neck cancer hnc remain press global health challeng particularli region lower socioeconom statu risk behavior tobacco use alcohol consumpt preval despit advanc treatment reliabl biomark earli detect monitor hnc remain lack alphag carbohydr epitop absent human present mammal garner interest due natur presenc antialphag antibodi human immun repertoir compris approxim 1 total circul igg investig role antialphag igg potenti biomark perform elisa serum sampl cohort 11 patient diagnos squamou cell carcinoma scc head neck eight older male patient live rural area engag manual occup high rate tobacco 818 alcohol consumpt 636 observ line establish risk factor hnc individu show significantli elev antialphag antibodi titer compar noncanc control chemotherapi cisplatin markedli affect antibodi level suggest consist immun reactiv across treatment statu result suggest antialphag antibodi may serv promis biomark candid hnc warrant investig clarifi potenti diagnost immunotherapeut applic
cancer,"Tumor cells undergo extensive metabolic reprogramming during malignant proliferation, with serine-a key nonessential amino acid-playing multiple roles in tumor metabolism. To maintain high serine levels, tumor cells upregulate phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase to enhance endogenous synthesis and concurrently increase exogenous uptake. Serine deprivation demonstrates antitumor potential across various malignancies; however, its clinical application remains limited by inadequate tumor selectivity and systemic toxicity. Recent advances in nanodelivery systems offer precise strategies to modulate tumor serine metabolism. Serine deprivation via these systems improves tumor-specific targeting while minimizing off-target toxicity to normal tissues. Therefore, this review aims to outline serine metabolism and its regulatory networks, evaluate the therapeutic potential and limitations of serine deprivation, and highlight recent advances in nanodelivery strategies targeting serine metabolism for cancer therapy, thereby providing insights for the development of novel anticancer approaches.",tumor cell undergo extens metabol reprogram malign prolifer serinea key nonessenti amino acidplay multipl role tumor metabol maintain high serin level tumor cell upregul phosphoglycer dehydrogenas enhanc endogen synthesi concurr increas exogen uptak serin depriv demonstr antitumor potenti across variou malign howev clinic applic remain limit inadequ tumor select system toxic recent advanc nanodeliveri system offer precis strategi modul tumor serin metabol serin depriv via system improv tumorspecif target minim offtarget toxic normal tissu therefor review aim outlin serin metabol regulatori network evalu therapeut potenti limit serin depriv highlight recent advanc nanodeliveri strategi target serin metabol cancer therapi therebi provid insight develop novel anticanc approach
cancer,"Numerous clinical studies indicate that neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) with immunotherapy can significantly increase pathological complete response (pCR) and clinical complete response (cCR) rates to over 30-60%, substantially higher than the 15-20% observed with conventional NCRT. This allows more patients to become eligible for a Watch-and-Wait (WW) strategy, successfully preserving organ function. Several phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are currently underway. The combination of NCRT and immunotherapy holds promise for breaking the therapeutic impasse in proficient mismatch repair/microsatellite stability (pMMR/MSS) rectal cancer, markedly enhancing tumor regression and the potential for organ preservation. However, challenges remain for NCRT combined with immunotherapy in this population. First of all, there is an unmet need to identify predictive biomarkers for treatment response in pMMR/MSS rectal cancer. Next, treatment protocols require further optimization, specifically in determining the best radiotherapy fractionation schedule, its sequencing with immunotherapy, and the radiotherapy target volume. Otherwise, the phenomenon of ""pseudo-residual disease"" complicates traditional radiological assessment of cCR and must be overcome. Furthermore, the long-term survival benefits of combining radiotherapy with immunotherapy need further confirmation. This review provided a comprehensive and in-depth view of immunotherapy-based NCRT (iNCRT) in patients with pMMR/MSS rectal cancer and discuss the new opportunities and challenges this strategy presents for achieving organ preservation.",numer clinic studi indic neoadjuv chemoradiotherapi ncrt immunotherapi significantli increas patholog complet respons pcr clinic complet respons ccr rate 3060 substanti higher 1520 observ convent ncrt allow patient becom elig watchandwait ww strategi success preserv organ function sever phase iii random control trial rct current underway combin ncrt immunotherapi hold promis break therapeut impass profici mismatch repairmicrosatellit stabil pmmrmss rectal cancer markedli enhanc tumor regress potenti organ preserv howev challeng remain ncrt combin immunotherapi popul first unmet need identifi predict biomark treatment respons pmmrmss rectal cancer next treatment protocol requir optim specif determin best radiotherapi fraction schedul sequenc immunotherapi radiotherapi target volum otherwis phenomenon pseudoresidu diseas complic tradit radiolog assess ccr must overcom furthermor longterm surviv benefit combin radiotherapi immunotherapi need confirm review provid comprehens indepth view immunotherapybas ncrt incrt patient pmmrmss rectal cancer discuss new opportun challeng strategi present achiev organ preserv

Recurrent anal canal carcinoma, which occurs in less than 1% of cases, is often accompanied by severe complications. Surgery plays a crucial role in improving patients' quality of life and controlling systemic paraneoplastic syndromes. This article reports a case of a 52-year-old female patient with recurrent anal canal squamous cell carcinoma (pT4bN0M0, Stage IIIB) 7 months after comprehensive treatment, complicated by rectovaginal fistula (RVF) and hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM). Following multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussions, an innovative approach combining free omental packing with gracilis myocutaneous flap was adopted for the treatment of an isolated sacrococcygeal recurrent tumor after anal canal squamous cell carcinoma surgery. A tumor mass with a maximum diameter of 12.5 cm was completely resected. Postoperative pathological examination confirmed that no cancer cells were detected in multiple biopsies of the free resection margin, achieving R0 resection. After surgery, the patient's serum calcium level and serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC) returned to normal. Meanwhile, the bilateral combined myocutaneous flaps survived completely, RVF symptoms disappeared, the patient's quality of life was significantly improved, and the survival prognosis was enhanced.",anal canal carcinoma rare malign account less 3 gastrointestin tumor recurr anal canal carcinoma occur less 1 case often accompani sever complic surgeri play crucial role improv patient qualiti life control system paraneoplast syndrom articl report case 52yearold femal patient recurr anal canal squamou cell carcinoma pt4bn0m0 stage iiib 7 month comprehens treatment complic rectovagin fistula rvf hypercalcemia malign hcm follow multidisciplinari team mdt discuss innov approach combin free oment pack gracili myocutan flap adopt treatment isol sacrococcyg recurr tumor anal canal squamou cell carcinoma surgeri tumor mass maximum diamet 125 cm complet resect postop patholog examin confirm cancer cell detect multipl biopsi free resect margin achiev r0 resect surgeri patient serum calcium level serum squamou cell carcinoma antigen scc return normal meanwhil bilater combin myocutan flap surviv complet rvf symptom disappear patient qualiti life significantli improv surviv prognosi enhanc
cancer,"PURPOSE: Robot-assisted surgery (RAS) has established itself as a minimally invasive approach in colorectal surgery, although evidence on its integration with Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS(R)) protocols in older patients remains limited. This study aims to describe short-term outcomes of RAS combined with a perioperative treatment according to the ERAS(R) protocols in patients >/=70 years. METHODS: This retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database includes all patients aged >/=70 years who underwent robotic colorectal resections at two German colorectal cancer centers between January 2019 and April 2024, managed perioperatively according to the ERAS(R) protocols. Primary endpoints were the patients' short-term perioperative outcomes, including duration of surgery, conversion rate, postoperative Intermediate-Care-Unit (IMC) admission, postoperative complications according to Clavien-Dindo, anastomotic leak and reoperation rate, length of hospital stay, and compliance to ERAS(R) guidelines. Results are presented descriptively without a comparator arm. RESULTS: A total of 161 patients (99 colon resections and 62 rectal resections) were included over the study period. Median duration of surgery was 153 (IQR: 130-197) minutes for colon and 243 (IQR: 120-467) minutes for rectal resections. Conversion rates were 1% and 4.8% respectively. Postoperative IMC admission was required in 9.1% (9 Patients) after colon and 12.9% (8 Patients) after rectal-resections, based on individual clinical assesement. Anastomotic leaks occurred in 7 cases (7%) following colon resections, with a total reoperation rate of 10%. Among rectal resections, the anastomotic leakage rate was 9.7% (6 cases) with a total reoperation rate of 16.1%. ERAS(R) compliance was 91.3% for colon- and 85% for rectal resections. Within the rectal cohort, postoperative complications were associated with a substantially lower perioperative ERAS(R) compliance compared to patients without complications (73.3% vs. 90.7%). Hospital stay was 5 days (IQR: 4-6 days) for colon- and 6 days (IQR: 5-11 days) for rectal resections. The 30-day readmission rate was 4% (4 cases) for colon and 8% (5 cases) for rectal resections. CONCLUSION: The integration of RAS colorectal surgery within ERAS(R) protocols appears feasible and is associated with acceptable short-term outcomes in elderly and comorbid patients. Nonetheless, these results should be interpreted as descriptive observations rather than inferential evidence.",purpos robotassist surgeri ra establish minim invas approach colorect surgeri although evid integr enhanc recoveri surgeri erasr protocol older patient remain limit studi aim describ shortterm outcom ra combin periop treatment accord erasr protocol patient 70 year method retrospect analysi prospect maintain databas includ patient age 70 year underw robot colorect resect two german colorect cancer center januari 2019 april 2024 manag periop accord erasr protocol primari endpoint patient shortterm periop outcom includ durat surgeri convers rate postop intermediatecareunit imc admiss postop complic accord claviendindo anastomot leak reoper rate length hospit stay complianc erasr guidelin result present descript without compar arm result total 161 patient 99 colon resect 62 rectal resect includ studi period median durat surgeri 153 iqr 130197 minut colon 243 iqr 120467 minut rectal resect convers rate 1 48 respect postop imc admiss requir 91 9 patient colon 129 8 patient rectalresect base individu clinic asses anastomot leak occur 7 case 7 follow colon resect total reoper rate 10 among rectal resect anastomot leakag rate 97 6 case total reoper rate 161 erasr complianc 913 colon 85 rectal resect within rectal cohort postop complic associ substanti lower periop erasr complianc compar patient without complic 733 vs 907 hospit stay 5 day iqr 46 day colon 6 day iqr 511 day rectal resect 30day readmiss rate 4 4 case colon 8 5 case rectal resect conclus integr ra colorect surgeri within erasr protocol appear feasibl associ accept shortterm outcom elderli comorbid patient nonetheless result interpret descript observ rather inferenti evid

cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Innovative strategies are crucial to meet the World Health Organization's 90/70/90 cervical cancer elimination targets, and to prevent millions of deaths by 2030. Women in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs) bear the greatest burden of cervical cancer, yet have limited access to cervical precancer treatment. Scalable solutions like self-administered intravaginal therapies can help close this treatment gap. In an ongoing Phase 1 trial of intravaginal artesunate pessaries as primary treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 (CIN 2/3), we evaluated the acceptability of this intervention among trial participants. METHODS: 17 participants completed in-depth interviews in their preferred language, focusing on their experiences with artesunate self-administration, including their interactions with the health system, partners, and community while on treatment. In the qualitative study, acceptability was defined as ""satisfaction with the product and willingness to use it in the future"" as well as ""correct and consistent use during the study."" We conducted a thematic analysis using the socioecological framework. RESULTS: Participants in this Phase 1 trial were primarily low-income women, with limited formal education, and the majority were also living with HIV and had been on antiretrovirals for over a decade. Despite minimal prior experience with vaginal self-administration of medication, participants found the pessary acceptable and were highly motivated to get treatment for cervical precancer. Social support, educational interventions, and faith were crucial in enabling participants to complete the treatment protocol successfully. CONCLUSION: Kenyan women found self-administered intravaginal artesunate for treating CIN2/3 to be highly acceptable. Randomized studies of intravaginal artesunate and other topical therapies in LMICs are needed to evaluate their use in closing the treatment gaps in these settings.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Sociocultural barriers including stigma significantly influence women's decisions around screening and treatment. OBJECTIVE: To explore how stigma influences women's experiences with cervical precancer care in the context of emerging self-administered topical therapies. DESIGN: A qualitative approach using convenience sampling. METHODS: Seventeen in-depth interviews were conducted between 2024 and 2025 in Kisumu, Kenya, with women who had been diagnosed with cervical precancer. Participants were recruited to self-administer intravaginal artesunate in a Phase I clinical trial, and interviews explored their experiences. Thematic analysis was conducted using the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework. RESULTS: All women discussed experiences indicative of enacted, anticipated, and internalized stigmas related to partner blame, disclosure, and imagining the diagnosis as an imminent death sentence. These stigmas were driven and facilitated by poverty and limited health care access, embarrassment around sexual health, community fears of cervical cancer death, patriarchal norms, and cervical precancer's disproportionate burden on women. Women with cervical precancer feel ""marked"" by medication usage, clinic visits, community expectations of a ""cancer"" appearance, or painful sexual intercourse. By exercising relational autonomy, women in this trial were able to navigate stigmas around sexual health and overcome the debilitating fear of death. They were ultimately able to complete the self-administered artesunate treatment course and initiate conversations in their communities to address stigmas around cervical precancer treatment. Nevertheless, stigmas caused delays to screening and treatment among some participants, while others experienced intimate partner violence or conflict during artesunate treatment. CONCLUSION: Stigmas around cervical precancer, artesunate usage, and abstinence requirements can deeply impact women's social experiences, intimate partnerships, and mental health. Future trials of self-administered therapies should integrate stigma reduction strategies developed in collaboration with participants and survivors.

cancer,"Paragangliomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors arising from extra-adrenal chromaffin cells. Although often silent, functional paragangliomas may present with catecholamine hypersecretion and life-threatening complications. Their incidental discovery during cancer staging is exceptionally uncommon and poses unique therapeutic challenges. We report the case of an 82-year-old woman presenting with breast cancer, in whom staging investigations revealed a 6-cm functional paraganglioma of the celiac space. A multidisciplinary team prioritized paraganglioma resection before oncologic breast surgery. Preoperative alpha-adrenergic blockade was administered for 15 days. Surgery was complicated by catecholamine surges requiring intensive hemodynamic and critical care support. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. Histopathological analysis confirmed paraganglioma, and the patient was subsequently referred back for breast surgery. This case illustrates the rare incidental discovery of a hormonally active celiac paraganglioma during breast cancer staging. It highlights the need for multidisciplinary planning and emphasizes the role of perioperative critical care in optimizing outcomes of functional paragangliomas.",paraganglioma rare neuroendocrin tumor aris extraadren chromaffin cell although often silent function paraganglioma may present catecholamin hypersecret lifethreaten complic incident discoveri cancer stage except uncommon pose uniqu therapeut challeng report case 82yearold woman present breast cancer stage investig reveal 6cm function paraganglioma celiac space multidisciplinari team priorit paraganglioma resect oncolog breast surgeri preoper alphaadrenerg blockad administ 15 day surgeri complic catecholamin surg requir intens hemodynam critic care support postop recoveri unev histopatholog analysi confirm paraganglioma patient subsequ refer back breast surgeri case illustr rare incident discoveri hormon activ celiac paraganglioma breast cancer stage highlight need multidisciplinari plan emphas role periop critic care optim outcom function paraganglioma
cancer,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignant tumors in men. In recent years, mitochondrial dysfunction has been found to be closely related to cancer progression. However, the role of mitochondria-related genes in PCa remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to discover novel biomarkers based on differentially expressed mitochondrial-related genes (DeMRGs) to aid in PCa diagnosis. In the present study, gene expression data from the Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases were combined with a mitochondrial-related gene list provided by the MitoCarta database to identify DeMRGs. Gene Ontology analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were then used to investigate the functions and related pathways of these DeMRGs. Subsequently, Cytoscape software and the STRING website were used to explore the transcription factors and microRNAs related to the DeMRGs. The degree of infiltration of immune cells in the immune landscape of patients with PCa and the controls was assessed using CIBERSORT. Finally, the correlation between characteristic DeMRGs and immune cell infiltration and mitochondrial respiration was analyzed. The results indicated that 6 characteristic genes, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta (ACACB), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), glycine amidinotransferase (GATM), methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase subunit 2, mitochondrial ribosomal protein L12 (MRPL12) and fatty acid synthase, were identified from the 60 DeMRGs. The results showed a close association between the characteristic DeMRGs and immune infiltrating cells. In addition, it was found that MRPL12, PDK4, ACACB and GATM were correlated with mitochondrial respiration. These 4 genes were selected as hub genes as they are closely related to gluconeogenesis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism and other mitochondrial metabolic pathways in PCa. In conclusion, 4 novel mitochondrial-related gene signatures that influence mitochondrial metabolism within the immune microenvironment were identified in PCa.",prostat cancer pca one common malign tumor men recent year mitochondri dysfunct found close relat cancer progress howev role mitochondriarel gene pca remain unclear aim present studi discov novel biomark base differenti express mitochondrialrel gene demrg aid pca diagnosi present studi gene express data gene express omnibu cancer genom atla databas combin mitochondrialrel gene list provid mitocarta databas identifi demrg gene ontolog analysi kyoto encyclopedia gene genom enrich analysi gene set enrich analysi use investig function relat pathway demrg subsequ cytoscap softwar string websit use explor transcript factor microrna relat demrg degre infiltr immun cell immun landscap patient pca control assess use cibersort final correl characterist demrg immun cell infiltr mitochondri respir analyz result indic 6 characterist gene includ acetylcoa carboxylas beta acacb pyruv dehydrogenas kinas 4 pdk4 glycin amidinotransferas gatm methylcrotonylcoa carboxylas subunit 2 mitochondri ribosom protein l12 mrpl12 fatti acid synthas identifi 60 demrg result show close associ characterist demrg immun infiltr cell addit found mrpl12 pdk4 acacb gatm correl mitochondri respir 4 gene select hub gene close relat gluconeogenesi tricarboxyl acid cycl lipid metabol amino acid metabol mitochondri metabol pathway pca conclus 4 novel mitochondrialrel gene signatur influenc mitochondri metabol within immun microenviron identifi pca
cancer,"Cancer is a global public health concern. Radiotherapy (RT) and immunotherapy are increasingly used in cancer treatment, but the specific immune mechanisms underlying their effects remain to be elucidated. The present study analyzed publicly available datasets, in which the T-cell receptor beta chain (TCRbeta) repertoire in tumor-bearing mice treated with RT and immunotherapy, as well as the TCR repertoire of T cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of mice exposed to radiation doses of 0, 10 and 100 mGy were comprehensively evaluated. The results of the present study indicated that the diversity of the TCRbeta complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) in tumor-bearing mice decreased after RT, anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) and anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) treatment, especially in the RT and RT + anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 treatment groups. Furthermore, the CDR3 length markedly decreased in the RT group and markedly increased in the anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 groups. Next, the TCR profile of T cells differentiated from HSCs exposed to different radiation doses was examined. As the radiation dose increased, the TCRbeta diversity in mice gradually decreased and the degree of clonal expansion markedly increased, the percentage of private sequences (unique sequences detected in only a single mouse) was markedly increased and the degree of overlap was markedly decreased. Furthermore, there was a notable difference in the usage frequency of TCRbeta chain variable/joining gene segments among the different radiation dose groups. The present study demonstrated that RT and immunotherapy may alter the TCR repertoire owing to their effects on HSCs.",cancer global public health concern radiotherapi rt immunotherapi increasingli use cancer treatment specif immun mechan underli effect remain elucid present studi analyz publicli avail dataset tcell receptor beta chain tcrbeta repertoir tumorbear mice treat rt immunotherapi well tcr repertoir cell deriv hematopoiet stem cell hsc mice expos radiat dose 0 10 100 mgi comprehens evalu result present studi indic divers tcrbeta complementaritydetermin region 3 cdr3 tumorbear mice decreas rt anticytotox tlymphocyteassoci protein4 ctla4 antiprogram cell death protein1 pd1 treatment especi rt rt antictla4 antipd1 treatment group furthermor cdr3 length markedli decreas rt group markedli increas antictla4 antipd1 group next tcr profil cell differenti hsc expos differ radiat dose examin radiat dose increas tcrbeta divers mice gradual decreas degre clonal expans markedli increas percentag privat sequenc uniqu sequenc detect singl mous markedli increas degre overlap markedli decreas furthermor notabl differ usag frequenc tcrbeta chain variablejoin gene segment among differ radiat dose group present studi demonstr rt immunotherapi may alter tcr repertoir owe effect hsc
cancer,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a leading cause of mortality among gynecological malignancies, predominantly due to late-stage diagnoses and complex management challenges. Traditional treatment strategies, primarily centered on extensive cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, have seen notable improvements through the integration of laparoscopy and robotic-assisted procedures. The safety and efficacy of minimally invasive techniques (MITs) have been demonstrated in early-stage EOC, although their applicability in advanced stages requires further investigation. Additionally, molecular-based and immunotherapies, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors and RNA-based treatments, offer promising adjuncts to MITs by targeting cancer-specific pathways with precision. Despite these innovations, patient selection, surgical expertise and adherence to oncological safety standards remain key factors in determining the efficacy and safety of MITs in EOC management. Future directions emphasize the need for standardized protocols, enhanced imaging techniques and real-time molecular monitoring, which aim to transition EOC management toward a minimally invasive, patient-centered approach.

cancer,"Tanshinone IIA (TSIIA) exerts antitumor effects. The present study aimed to explore the pharmacological effect of TSIIA on lung cancer development and assess the potential underlying mechanism of action. Cell viability and proliferation were assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8 and 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine assays, respectively. Transwell assays were performed to determine cell migration and invasion. Histone H3 lysine 18 acetylation (H3K18ac) and histone H4 lysine 8 acetylation (H4K8ac) enrichment in the RING finger protein 123 (RNF123) promoter and the interaction between lysine acetyltransferase 2B (KAT2B) and the RNF123 promoter were analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The results indicated that RNF123 was weakly expressed in lung cancer cells, and its upregulation decreased lung cancer cell viability, proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Sodium TSIIA sulfate (STS) treatment inhibited the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell malignant phenotypes, which were reversed by the knockdown of RNF123. Mechanistically, TSIIA promoted KAT2B-mediated H3K18ac modification at the promoter region of the RNF123 gene, leading to upregulated RNF123 expression in NSCLC cells. Additionally, KAT2B knockdown prevented the STS-induced inhibition of NSCLC cell malignant phenotypes. Furthermore, RNF123 upregulation restored the effect of KAT2B knockdown on STS-treated NSCLC phenotypes. In conclusion, TSIIA inhibited the NSCLC cell malignant phenotypes via the epigenetic modification of RNF123.",tanshinon iia tsiia exert antitumor effect present studi aim explor pharmacolog effect tsiia lung cancer develop assess potenti underli mechan action cell viabil prolifer assess use cell count kit8 5ethynyl20deoxyuridin assay respect transwel assay perform determin cell migrat invas histon h3 lysin 18 acetyl h3k18ac histon h4 lysin 8 acetyl h4k8ac enrich ring finger protein 123 rnf123 promot interact lysin acetyltransferas 2b kat2b rnf123 promot analyz chromatin immunoprecipit assay result indic rnf123 weakli express lung cancer cell upregul decreas lung cancer cell viabil prolifer migrat invas epithelialmesenchym transit sodium tsiia sulfat st treatment inhibit nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc cell malign phenotyp revers knockdown rnf123 mechanist tsiia promot kat2bmedi h3k18ac modif promot region rnf123 gene lead upregul rnf123 express nsclc cell addit kat2b knockdown prevent stsinduc inhibit nsclc cell malign phenotyp furthermor rnf123 upregul restor effect kat2b knockdown ststreat nsclc phenotyp conclus tsiia inhibit nsclc cell malign phenotyp via epigenet modif rnf123
cancer,"The BCL-X (L) anti-apoptotic protein is a clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) dependency; however, the mechanism of this dependence and its relevance in other aggressive kidney cancer contexts, including metastatic and/or rare RCC subtypes [e.g., Fumarate Hydratase (FH)-deficient and sarcomatoid RCCs], is unknown. Computational predictions, using a machine learning model trained on the human RCC TCGA dataset, and cell-based validations, confirmed BCL-X (L) dependence in all RCC subtypes. Remarkably, cell state changes, 'anoikis' programs, inflammatory state, and metabolic perturbations (e.g., fumarate production in FH-deficient RCCs) independently conferred increased BCL-X (L) dependence. Correlation studies revealed that increased AMPK isoform 2 ( PRKAA2 ) expression is a kidney-specific biomarker of BCL-X (L) dependence. Indeed, pharmacological AMPK activation sensitized RCCs to BCL-X (L) blockade. Finally, using functional studies, we developed a multivariate model that accurately predicted BCL-X (L) dependence in RCC.

cancer,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in American men, with African American/Black (AA/B) men experiencing higher incidence and mortality than European American (EA) men. Obesity, which disproportionately affects AA/B men, is linked to increased PCa mortality, potentially through metabolic dysregulation. We hypothesize that methylglyoxal (MG), a reactive byproduct of glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism that is elevated in obesity, contributes to PCa progression. MG forms covalent adducts on DNA, RNA, and protein. We found that MG-adducts are elevated in AA/B men with PCa compared to EA men with PCa, as well as men without PCa. AA/B men with PCa had a higher frequency of SNP rs1049346 in glyoxalase 1 (GLO1), the primary MG detoxification enzyme. PCa cell lines from EA (C4-2) and AA/B (MDA-PCa-2b) men showed differential rs1049346 status, with C4-2 cells heterozygous and MDA-PCa-2b cells homozygous for the variant. This was associated with altered GLO1 expression and activity, with MDA-PCa-2b cells exhibiting reduced GLO1 function and increased MG-adducts compared to C4-2 cells. MG altered DNA repair and RNA processing pathways and induced distinct metabolic shifts in MDA-PCa-2b compared to C4-2 cells, including increased glycolysis and reduced oxidative phosphorylation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed unique MG-induced stress responses including a tenfold higher induction of TXNIP in MDA-PCa-2b vs. C4-2 cells, a gene inversely linked to GLO1 expression and activity. These findings suggest that MG stress may contribute to PCa progression in AA/B men through metabolic reprogramming and impaired detoxification, offering insight into potential precision medicine applications.

Defining how metabolic alterations contribute to this link is critical to understanding disease progression and identifying strategies to improve outcomes.",prostat cancer pca second lead caus cancerrel death american men african americanblack aab men experienc higher incid mortal european american ea men obes disproportion affect aab men link increas pca mortal potenti metabol dysregul hypothes methylglyox mg reactiv byproduct glucos lipid protein metabol elev obes contribut pca progress mg form coval adduct dna rna protein found mgadduct elev aab men pca compar ea men pca well men without pca aab men pca higher frequenc snp rs1049346 glyoxalas 1 glo1 primari mg detoxif enzym pca cell line ea c42 aab mdapca2b men show differenti rs1049346 statu c42 cell heterozyg mdapca2b cell homozyg variant associ alter glo1 express activ mdapca2b cell exhibit reduc glo1 function increas mgadduct compar c42 cell mg alter dna repair rna process pathway induc distinct metabol shift mdapca2b compar c42 cell includ increas glycolysi reduc oxid phosphoryl transcriptom analysi reveal uniqu mginduc stress respons includ tenfold higher induct txnip mdapca2b vs c42 cell gene invers link glo1 express activ find suggest mg stress may contribut pca progress aab men metabol reprogram impair detoxif offer insight potenti precis medicin applic statement signific patient obes diabet elev risk cancer mortal defin metabol alter contribut link critic understand diseas progress identifi strategi improv outcom
cancer,"The dynamic mechanical response of tissues underlies their physiological function, yet direct, quantitative measurement of tissue stress in vivo has remained a major challenge. Here, we introduce the m echano M R m icroparticle (M (3) , ""M-cube"") sensor, a hybrid soft-matter/nanoparticle probe that integrates directly into tissue mechanical networks while transducing local stress into quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) readouts with single-particle resolution. We demonstrate the utility of this platform across diverse model systems, including tumor spheroids, Xenopus embryos, and mouse xenografts, where the M (3) sensor enables noninvasive, spatiotemporally resolved mapping of tissue stress dynamics during cancer development. Using this approach, we reveal that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is accompanied by distinctive stress-remodeling patterns observable in vivo . Strikingly, we find that abrupt stress increases, rather than cumulative or peak stress magnitude, are the key determinants of EMT induction in cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment. Transcriptomic profiling under controlled stress-loading dynamics shows that sustained yet gradual stress escalation activates cytoprotective antioxidation pathways (e.g., FOXO/AMPK) that reinforce epithelial stability, whereas acute stress surges overwhelm these defense mechanisms, predisposing cells toward mesenchymal reprogramming. These findings establish the M (3) sensor as a broadly applicable technology for linking dynamic mechanical cues to cell-state transitions in development, homeostasis, and disease.",dynam mechan respons tissu underli physiolog function yet direct quantit measur tissu stress vivo remain major challeng introduc echano r icroparticl 3 mcube sensor hybrid softmatternanoparticl probe integr directli tissu mechan network transduc local stress quantit magnet reson mr readout singleparticl resolut demonstr util platform across divers model system includ tumor spheroid xenopu embryo mous xenograft 3 sensor enabl noninvas spatiotempor resolv map tissu stress dynam cancer develop use approach reveal epithelialmesenchym transit emt accompani distinct stressremodel pattern observ vivo strikingli find abrupt stress increas rather cumul peak stress magnitud key determin emt induct cancer cell within tumor microenviron transcriptom profil control stressload dynam show sustain yet gradual stress escal activ cytoprotect antioxid pathway eg foxoampk reinforc epitheli stabil wherea acut stress surg overwhelm defens mechan predispos cell toward mesenchym reprogram find establish 3 sensor broadli applic technolog link dynam mechan cue cellstat transit develop homeostasi diseas
cancer,"Complex neuronal circuits arise from a small set of cell-surface receptors that position neurons, promote axon extension, and define synaptic connections. A central receptor is Deleted in Colon Cancer (DCC), which mediates both short- and long-range axon guidance and confines migrating neurons to the central nervous system. DCC's versatility reflects its ability to interact at distinct sites of its extracellular domain with two ligands, Netrin-1 and Draxin, which also bind to each other. Alternative splicing further alters the Netrin-1 binding site and modulates affinity. By generating two mouse lines with mutations that selectively impair DCC binding to Netrin-1 and/or Draxin, we show that molecular modularity within the DCC extracellular domain is essential for precise circuit assembly. An eight-amino acid insertion in the DCC (long) isoform is required for Netrin-1-dependent long-range commissural axon guidance in the spinal cord. Conversely, isoleucine 372 in the Draxin binding site enables DCC clustering and is necessary for all known DCC functions, including axon guidance in the spinal cord and retina and neuronal migration in the brainstem. Draxin also supports long-range commissural guidance, but mutations in its binding site cause stronger defects. These results underscore how DCC's distinct modules drive specific developmental responses.",complex neuron circuit aris small set cellsurfac receptor posit neuron promot axon extens defin synapt connect central receptor delet colon cancer dcc mediat short longrang axon guidanc confin migrat neuron central nervou system dcc versatil reflect abil interact distinct site extracellular domain two ligand netrin1 draxin also bind altern splice alter netrin1 bind site modul affin gener two mous line mutat select impair dcc bind netrin1 andor draxin show molecular modular within dcc extracellular domain essenti precis circuit assembl eightamino acid insert dcc long isoform requir netrin1depend longrang commissur axon guidanc spinal cord convers isoleucin 372 draxin bind site enabl dcc cluster necessari known dcc function includ axon guidanc spinal cord retina neuron migrat brainstem draxin also support longrang commissur guidanc mutat bind site caus stronger defect result underscor dcc distinct modul drive specif development respons
cancer,"Cancer immunotherapies, from checkpoint blockade to adoptive cell therapies like tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), have revolutionized cancer treatment but are limited by variable efficacy and significant toxicities. A central challenge is identifying ideal T-cell populations that effectively eliminate tumors without causing off-target damage, a distinction not captured by existing biomarkers. We show that co-expression patterns of chemokine receptors (CRs) CXCR3, CCR5, and CXCR6 on CD8 (+) T cells provide a functional ""code"" defining subsets with divergent roles in on-target immunity versus off-target inflammation. In mouse and human melanoma, a triple-positive (CXCR3 (+) CCR5 (+) CXCR6 (+) ) T-cell subset is essential for tumor control, and its genetic signature correlates with positive clinical response, while a distinct CCR5 (+) CXCR6 (+) subset drives liver immune-related adverse events (IRAEs). Crucially, this CR code reveals that immunotherapy actively reshapes T-cell trafficking patterns, uncovering profound heterogeneity within conventional populations and distinguishing potent anti-tumor progenitors from cells predisposed to exhaustion or off-target migration. This work establishes CR co-expression as a practical tool, providing a surface marker-based strategy to identify and enrich optimized T cells for adoptive therapies, thereby offering a framework to uncouple efficacy from toxicity.",cancer immunotherapi checkpoint blockad adopt cell therapi like tumorinfiltr lymphocyt til revolution cancer treatment limit variabl efficaci signific toxic central challeng identifi ideal tcell popul effect elimin tumor without caus offtarget damag distinct captur exist biomark show coexpress pattern chemokin receptor cr cxcr3 ccr5 cxcr6 cd8 cell provid function code defin subset diverg role ontarget immun versu offtarget inflamm mous human melanoma tripleposit cxcr3 ccr5 cxcr6 tcell subset essenti tumor control genet signatur correl posit clinic respons distinct ccr5 cxcr6 subset drive liver immunerel advers event ira crucial cr code reveal immunotherapi activ reshap tcell traffick pattern uncov profound heterogen within convent popul distinguish potent antitumor progenitor cell predispos exhaust offtarget migrat work establish cr coexpress practic tool provid surfac markerbas strategi identifi enrich optim cell adopt therapi therebi offer framework uncoupl efficaci toxic
cancer,"Spatial omics technologies offer unprecedented insights into the cellular organization of tissues; however, they are not yet scalable for routine clinical use. In contrast, images of histological staining remain the foundation of pathological diagnosis despite lacking molecular information. Bridging this gap requires computational methods that can accurately infer spatial molecular data from histology alone. Here, we introduce TissueCraftAI, a generative artificial intelligence framework that predicts multi-modal spatial omics maps directly from standard histology images using natural language prompts. To train and validate our model, we created PRISM-12M, a large-scale dataset comprising over twelve million spatially registered histology and spatial omics image patches across fourteen tissue types from humans and mice. TissueCraftAI significantly outperforms existing methods in generating realistic histology images and predicting spatial proteomics and transcriptomics data with high fidelity. We demonstrated its utility in various downstream applications, including improving cell type annotation and enhancing the accuracy of patient survival predictions across multiple cancer types. By enabling flexible, query-driven in silico spatial molecular analysis using routine histology images, TissueCraftAI opens up new research avenues in computational pathology.",spatial omic technolog offer unpreced insight cellular organ tissu howev yet scalabl routin clinic use contrast imag histolog stain remain foundat patholog diagnosi despit lack molecular inform bridg gap requir comput method accur infer spatial molecular data histolog alon introduc tissuecraftai gener artifici intellig framework predict multimod spatial omic map directli standard histolog imag use natur languag prompt train valid model creat prism12m largescal dataset compris twelv million spatial regist histolog spatial omic imag patch across fourteen tissu type human mice tissuecraftai significantli outperform exist method gener realist histolog imag predict spatial proteom transcriptom data high fidel demonstr util variou downstream applic includ improv cell type annot enhanc accuraci patient surviv predict across multipl cancer type enabl flexibl querydriven silico spatial molecular analysi use routin histolog imag tissuecraftai open new research avenu comput patholog
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Adoptive cell therapy using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma but is limited by the need for patients to undergo surgical tumor resection. Malignant pleural effusions (MPE) may represent a more accessible source of tumor-reactive T cells. Here, we characterize the cellular composition as well as the transcriptional and functional properties of T cells from MPE compared with pulmonary metastasis and blood from a patient with melanoma. METHODS: The immune cellular composition was immunophenotyped by high-dimensional flow cytometry from synchronously collected MPE, a lung metastasis, and blood from a patient with metastatic melanoma. Sorted CD3 (+) T cells were profiled by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq). TCR reactivity to autologous tumor was evaluated through in vitro activation assays with TCR-transduced Jurkat and autologous cancer cells. The killing capacity of ex vivo expanded T cells of autologous cancer cells was assessed through in vitro cytotoxicity assays. RESULTS: MPE had higher proportions of CD45 (+) immune cells and CD3 (+) T cells (70.5% vs 50%) compared with tumor and was enriched for effector CD8 (+) T cells, CCR7 (-) CD45RA (-) effector memory CD4 (+) T cells, and quiescent CD25 (high) CD127 (low) regulatory CD4 (+) T cells. MPE T cells exhibited lower levels of co-inhibitory receptors (PD-1, LAG-3, TIGIT, TIM-3) expression relative to tumor. ScRNA-seq showed enrichment of NK-like effector CD8 (+) T cells in MPE. Pseudotime analysis indicated that MPE T cells were less exhausted than tumor T cells. The clonal repertoire of MPE and tumor highly overlapped, including 62.2% of predicted neoantigen-specific (NeoTCR) clonotypes. Notably, clonally-related NeoTCR T cells in MPE exhibited higher cytotoxic and stemness, and lower exhaustion signatures compared with sister clones in the tumor. Two of four selected NeoTCR clonotypes transduced in Jurkat cells demonstrated MHC class I-restricted reactivity in co-culture with autologous cancer cells. MPE T cells also readily expanded in the presence of high-dose IL-2 and demonstrated MHC class I-dependent killing of autologous cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: MPE harbors polyclonal, tumor-reactive T cells with lower features of terminal exhaustion and higher cytotoxic potential relative to tumor T cells. MPE may therefore serve as a more accessible source for TIL therapy.",background adopt cell therapi use tumorinfiltr lymphocyt til approv treatment advanc melanoma limit need patient undergo surgic tumor resect malign pleural effus mpe may repres access sourc tumorreact cell character cellular composit well transcript function properti cell mpe compar pulmonari metastasi blood patient melanoma method immun cellular composit immunophenotyp highdimension flow cytometri synchron collect mpe lung metastasi blood patient metastat melanoma sort cd3 cell profil singlecel rna sequenc scrnaseq cell receptor sequenc sctcrseq tcr reactiv autolog tumor evalu vitro activ assay tcrtransduc jurkat autolog cancer cell kill capac ex vivo expand cell autolog cancer cell assess vitro cytotox assay result mpe higher proport cd45 immun cell cd3 cell 705 vs 50 compar tumor enrich effector cd8 cell ccr7 cd45ra effector memori cd4 cell quiescent cd25 high cd127 low regulatori cd4 cell mpe cell exhibit lower level coinhibitori receptor pd1 lag3 tigit tim3 express rel tumor scrnaseq show enrich nklike effector cd8 cell mpe pseudotim analysi indic mpe cell less exhaust tumor cell clonal repertoir mpe tumor highli overlap includ 622 predict neoantigenspecif neotcr clonotyp notabl clonallyrel neotcr cell mpe exhibit higher cytotox stem lower exhaust signatur compar sister clone tumor two four select neotcr clonotyp transduc jurkat cell demonstr mhc class irestrict reactiv cocultur autolog cancer cell mpe cell also readili expand presenc highdos il2 demonstr mhc class idepend kill autolog cancer cell conclus mpe harbor polyclon tumorreact cell lower featur termin exhaust higher cytotox potenti rel tumor cell mpe may therefor serv access sourc til therapi
cancer,"Lethal toxins could become potent therapies against cancer, but their clinical utility is limited by adverse events upon systemic administration. These could be reduced if the toxins were delivered by effector cells that specifically infiltrate cancers, thereby releasing toxins locally into the tumor microenvironment. One of the challenges underlying this strategy is that cells delivering toxins would have to be resistant to them. We address this obstacle by showing that effectors derived from transformed human cell lines genetically engineered for resistance to bacterial adenosine diphosphate ribosylating toxins (ADPRTs), including Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PE), can produce targeted immunotoxins that specifically kill cancer cells expressing cognate tumor-associated antigens. Resistance to immunotoxins was achieved by knockout of genes in the diphthamide biosynthesis pathway ( DPH1-4 ) required for the posttranslational modification of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EEF2) that is the target of ADPRTs, or by mutation of EEF2 itself. We show that engineering resistance to ADPRTs, one of the most potent toxins acting on human cells, is essential to achieve robust function of armored effector cell lines. This work establishes a first step on the path to equip effector cells with the ability to deliver powerful toxins to cancer cells and introduces a platform to investigate extension to primary autologous or allogeneic therapeutic cell types.",lethal toxin could becom potent therapi cancer clinic util limit advers event upon system administr could reduc toxin deliv effector cell specif infiltr cancer therebi releas toxin local tumor microenviron one challeng underli strategi cell deliv toxin would resist address obstacl show effector deriv transform human cell line genet engin resist bacteri adenosin diphosph ribosyl toxin adprt includ pseudomona aeruginosa exotoxin pe produc target immunotoxin specif kill cancer cell express cognat tumorassoci antigen resist immunotoxin achiev knockout gene diphthamid biosynthesi pathway dph14 requir posttransl modif eukaryot elong factor 2 eef2 target adprt mutat eef2 show engin resist adprt one potent toxin act human cell essenti achiev robust function armor effector cell line work establish first step path equip effector cell abil deliv power toxin cancer cell introduc platform investig extens primari autolog allogen therapeut cell type
cancer,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) are approved for homologous recombination-deficient (HRD) high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs), but their long-term effectiveness is limited by the emergence of resistance and hematological toxicity. Approximately 50% of HGSOCs are homologous recombination-proficient (HRP), and within this group, about 20% harbor CCNE1 amplification (cyclin E1-high). PARPi are especially ineffective in HRP tumors and in CCNE1 -high HGSOCs, which represent a major unmet clinical need. Loss of a chromatin remodeling enzyme, Amplified in Liver Cancer 1, ALC1, has been shown to enhance PARPi sensitivity. However, the clinical contexts in which ALC1 targeting will be clinically meaningful remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that ALC1 loss can enhance PARPi sensitivity across HRD and cyclin E1-high serous ovarian cancer lines, xenografts and patient-derived cells. ALC1 depletion can overcome several clinically relevant mechanisms of PARPi resistance, though its impact is limited in tumors with complete restoration of HR. Lower ALC1 expression correlates with longer progression-free survival and extended PARPi response. Importantly, ALC1 loss has minimal effects in BRCA -wild-type or BRCA -heterozygous non-cancerous fallopian tube cells, suggesting therapeutic safety. Increased PARPi sensitivity following ALC1 loss can be accurately predicted by endogenous single-stranded DNA levels, identifying a functional biomarker. Together, our studies define the clinical contexts in which the therapeutic utility of PARPi can be expanded by targeting ALC1, whose inhibitors are currently under evaluation in Phase I clinical trials.",poli adpribos polymeras inhibitor parpi approv homolog recombinationdefici hrd highgrad serou ovarian cancer hgsoc longterm effect limit emerg resist hematolog toxic approxim 50 hgsoc homolog recombinationprofici hrp within group 20 harbor ccne1 amplif cyclin e1high parpi especi ineffect hrp tumor ccne1 high hgsoc repres major unmet clinic need loss chromatin remodel enzym amplifi liver cancer 1 alc1 shown enhanc parpi sensit howev clinic context alc1 target clinic meaning remain unclear demonstr alc1 loss enhanc parpi sensit across hrd cyclin e1high serou ovarian cancer line xenograft patientderiv cell alc1 deplet overcom sever clinic relev mechan parpi resist though impact limit tumor complet restor hr lower alc1 express correl longer progressionfre surviv extend parpi respons importantli alc1 loss minim effect brca wildtyp brca heterozyg noncancer fallopian tube cell suggest therapeut safeti increas parpi sensit follow alc1 loss accur predict endogen singlestrand dna level identifi function biomark togeth studi defin clinic context therapeut util parpi expand target alc1 whose inhibitor current evalu phase clinic trial
cancer,"Invadopodia are actin- and protease-rich membrane structures present on metastatic cancer cells. We have previously shown that invadopodia-mediated ECM degradation is cell cycle-dependent. In mesenchymal human breast cancer cells, invadopodia degrade predominantly in G1 phase of the cell cycle. More recently, we have discovered that the hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) metastatic cells also have the ability to assemble invadopodia. Here, we investigated how different EMT states affect the cell cycle regulation of invadopodia and invasion of breast cancer cells. Starting with the Early E/M cell line 4T1, we used TGFbeta1 treatment to transition cells to a Late E/M state, or the induced Slug overexpression to achieve a fully mesenchymal (M) state, characterized by the complete loss of E-cadherin. We demonstrated that in Early E/M cells, invadopodia-mediated ECM degradation and invasion occur predominantly during the G2 phase, while Late E/M preferentially degrade ECM and invade during the G1, similarly to M cells. Moreover, when E cells are treated with TGFbeta1, they transition to Early E/M state and degrade in G2 phase. To identify invadopodia components responsible for EMT- and cell cycle-dependent ECM degradation, we performed bulk mRNA sequencing of Early-versus Late-E/M cells in G1-or G2-phase of the cell cycle. The top candidate of our RNASeq analysis, FILIP1L, was expressed at significantly higher levels during G2 phase in Early E/M cells and during G1 phase in Late E/M cells, matching the invasive phase of each cell population. Expression of FILIP1L is upregulated in cells transitioning from E/M to M state. We next demonstrate FILIP1L is a novel invadopodia component, which colocalizes with Tks5 and cortactin. In the absence of FILIP1L expression, ECM degradation is significantly increased. Meanwhile, cell migration is significantly decreased, resulting in an overall decrease in the 3D spheroid invasion. Finally, we demonstrate that the high expression of FILIP1L is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. In summary, FILIP1L is a novel invadopodia component which regulates breast cancer invasion and tumor progression in a cell cycle- and EMT-dependent manner by controlling invadopodia and motility of cancer cells.",invadopodia actin proteaserich membran structur present metastat cancer cell previous shown invadopodiamedi ecm degrad cell cycledepend mesenchym human breast cancer cell invadopodia degrad predominantli g1 phase cell cycl recent discov hybrid epithelialmesenchym em metastat cell also abil assembl invadopodia investig differ emt state affect cell cycl regul invadopodia invas breast cancer cell start earli em cell line 4t1 use tgfbeta1 treatment transit cell late em state induc slug overexpress achiev fulli mesenchym state character complet loss ecadherin demonstr earli em cell invadopodiamedi ecm degrad invas occur predominantli g2 phase late em preferenti degrad ecm invad g1 similarli cell moreov e cell treat tgfbeta1 transit earli em state degrad g2 phase identifi invadopodia compon respons emt cell cycledepend ecm degrad perform bulk mrna sequenc earlyversu lateem cell g1or g2phase cell cycl top candid rnaseq analysi filip1l express significantli higher level g2 phase earli em cell g1 phase late em cell match invas phase cell popul express filip1l upregul cell transit em state next demonstr filip1l novel invadopodia compon coloc tks5 cortactin absenc filip1l express ecm degrad significantli increas meanwhil cell migrat significantli decreas result overal decreas 3d spheroid invas final demonstr high express filip1l associ poor prognosi breast cancer patient summari filip1l novel invadopodia compon regul breast cancer invas tumor progress cell cycl emtdepend manner control invadopodia motil cancer cell
cancer,"Cancer driver mutations alone are often insufficient to fully explain tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that these mutations cooperate with somatic copy number variations (CNVs) in a tissue-specific pattern of genomic epistasis. Analyzing 93,462 tumors, we identified 54 gene-cancer type pairs with significant co-occurrence of somatic mutations and CNVs. Our new Binoculars algorithm, which resolved phased DNA/RNA reads, revealed frequent preferential amplification in oncogenic mutation alleles, including AKT1 p.E17K, BRAF p.V600E, KRAS p.G12C/D/V, NRAS p.Q61K, and a fraction of gain-of-function TP53 p.R175H. Conversely, deletions selectively targeted the reference alleles, leading to loss of heterozygosity of IDH1 p.R132H and tumor suppressor mutations, including CDKN2A and TP53 truncations. Lung cancer patients carrying co-occurrences of somatic mutation-CNVs in TP53 and KRAS showed poorer survival than those carrying the same gene mutations. These findings reveal epistasis of cancer mutations and CNVs at an allelic resolution, suggesting specific genomic events to enhance patient stratification and therapeutic targeting.",cancer driver mutat alon often insuffici fulli explain tumorigenesi demonstr mutat cooper somat copi number variat cnv tissuespecif pattern genom epistasi analyz 93462 tumor identifi 54 genecanc type pair signific cooccurr somat mutat cnv new binocular algorithm resolv phase dnarna read reveal frequent preferenti amplif oncogen mutat allel includ akt1 pe17k braf pv600e kra pg12cdv nra pq61k fraction gainoffunct tp53 pr175h convers delet select target refer allel lead loss heterozygos idh1 pr132h tumor suppressor mutat includ cdkn2a tp53 truncat lung cancer patient carri cooccurr somat mutationcnv tp53 kra show poorer surviv carri gene mutat find reveal epistasi cancer mutat cnv allel resolut suggest specif genom event enhanc patient stratif therapeut target
cancer,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Growing evidence highlight the critical role of the gut microbiome in tumorigenesis and response to immunotherapies. However, the impact of gut microbes on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression and response to immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) remains unclear due to the lack of combined preclinical and clinical studies. APPROACH & RESULTS: We performed 16S rRNA of cross-cohort stool samples from 10 HCC responders (R) and 40 non-responders (NR) to ICB at baseline and on-treatment time-points. We identified an enrichment of Bacteroidetes in NR. To study the role of the microbiome in the cancer immune response, we generated an immunogenic mouse model of HCC via hydrodynamic tail-vein injection (HDTVI) of DNA plasmids mimicking common HCC alterations and immunogenicity by expressing model antigens ( MYC-lucOS;CTNNB1 tumors). We found that antibiotic (ABX)-induced dysbiosis promoted a pro-tumorigenic effect in the MYC-lucOS;CTNNB1 HCC model by the expansion of a specific Bacteroidetes , Parabacteroides distasonis . Colonization of mice carrying MYC-lucOS;CTNNB1 HCCs with Parabacteroides distasonis confirmed its pro-tumorigenic effect in vivo. Furthermore, we explored the effects of colonizing with microbiotas from patients and showed that microbiota from a NR donor enriched in Bacteroidetes promoted faster tumorigenesis than microbiota from a R donor with reduced Bacteroidetes . We isolated 6 Bacteroidetes species from the NR donor, cultured them, and used them as a cocktail to colonize mice; similarly, mice transplanted with this cocktail showed increased tumorigenesis and reduced survival. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified Bacteroidetes enrichment as a potential biomarker of ICB resistance in HCC and, by using immunogenic mouse models, established that Bacteroidetes abundance influences tumor development.",background aim grow evid highlight critic role gut microbiom tumorigenesi respons immunotherapi howev impact gut microb hepatocellular carcinoma hcc progress respons immunecheckpoint blockad icb remain unclear due lack combin preclin clinic studi approach result perform 16 rrna crosscohort stool sampl 10 hcc respond r 40 nonrespond nr icb baselin ontreat timepoint identifi enrich bacteroidet nr studi role microbiom cancer immun respons gener immunogen mous model hcc via hydrodynam tailvein inject hdtvi dna plasmid mimick common hcc alter immunogen express model antigen myclucosctnnb1 tumor found antibiot abxinduc dysbiosi promot protumorigen effect myclucosctnnb1 hcc model expans specif bacteroidet parabacteroid distasoni colon mice carri myclucosctnnb1 hcc parabacteroid distasoni confirm protumorigen effect vivo furthermor explor effect colon microbiota patient show microbiota nr donor enrich bacteroidet promot faster tumorigenesi microbiota r donor reduc bacteroidet isol 6 bacteroidet speci nr donor cultur use cocktail colon mice similarli mice transplant cocktail show increas tumorigenesi reduc surviv conclus studi identifi bacteroidet enrich potenti biomark icb resist hcc use immunogen mous model establish bacteroidet abund influenc tumor develop
cancer,"Among prostate cancer patients, co-morbid Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is associated with faster progression to biochemical recurrence and increased risk of mortality. Previous work from our lab provides evidence that exosomes purified from media of insulin resistant adipocytes or T2D patient plasma likely drives these outcomes by delivering miRNAs that exacerbate tumor aggressiveness in several breast and prostate cancer models. Here, we build on our previous findings to investigate whether treatment with metabolic medications attenuates the tumor promoting effects of exosomes. We found that human DU145 cells, a model for prostate cancer, treated with plasma exosomes from T2D patients, shows patterns in global gene transcription that resolve by patient treatment with metformin. To test the effects of metformin experimentally, we used a murine model of insulin resistance (IR). Treating DU145 cells with miRNAs purified from the plasma exosomes of IR mice, we found that cells transfected with miRNAs from the metformin-treated IR group displayed significantly less migration than cells transfected with miRNAs from the unmedicated IR group. We suggest that metformin may partially reverse effects of T2D to exacerbate tumor aggressiveness by modifying the miRNA payload of plasma exosomes.",among prostat cancer patient comorbid type 2 diabet t2d associ faster progress biochem recurr increas risk mortal previou work lab provid evid exosom purifi media insulin resist adipocyt t2d patient plasma like drive outcom deliv mirna exacerb tumor aggress sever breast prostat cancer model build previou find investig whether treatment metabol medic attenu tumor promot effect exosom found human du145 cell model prostat cancer treat plasma exosom t2d patient show pattern global gene transcript resolv patient treatment metformin test effect metformin experiment use murin model insulin resist ir treat du145 cell mirna purifi plasma exosom ir mice found cell transfect mirna metformintr ir group display significantli less migrat cell transfect mirna unmed ir group suggest metformin may partial revers effect t2d exacerb tumor aggress modifi mirna payload plasma exosom
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Ewing sarcoma (EwS) is a highly aggressive cancer driven by the EWS::FLI1 fusion oncoprotein affecting children, adolescents, and young adults. Six transmembrane epithelial antigen 1 (STEAP1) is a cell surface antigen transcriptionally controlled by EWS::FLI1 that is broadly expressed in EwS, positioning it as a rational immunotherapy target. However, translating CAR T therapy to solid tumors requires overcoming barriers to potency while maintaining safety. METHODS: Analyses of transcriptome and proteome data were performed to evaluate the effects of EWS::FLI1 perturbation on STEAP1 expression at the transcript and protein levels in EwS models. STEAP1 expression was validated in EwS patient tissues by immunohistochemistry. Second-generation STEAP1-BBzeta CAR T cells were tested in orthotopic and disseminated EwS xenograft models. To enhance antitumor activity, an IL-18-armored STEAP1 CAR was engineered. Dose-dependent therapeutic efficacy and safety were evaluated through measurement of tumor burden, survival, and observation for gross toxicities. RESULTS: STEAP1 was expressed in  approximately 97% of primary EwS tumors and directly associated with EWS::FLI1 fusion protein expression in EwS cell lines. In orthotopic EwS models, STEAP1 CAR T cells induced complete tumor regression at 5 x 10 (6) cells. In disseminated disease models, responses were dose-dependent with no evidence of antigen loss. Notably, IL-18 armored STEAP1 CAR T cells achieved complete responses in  approximately 80% of mice at a reduced dose of 10 (6) cells without overt toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These data establish STEAP1 as a clinically relevant and highly expressed target in EwS and demonstrate that IL-18 armoring significantly improves CAR T cell efficacy by enhancing potency evident through antitumor activity at reduced cell dose. STEAP1 CAR T cells are currently under evaluation in a first-in-human phase 1/2 dose-escalation clinical trial for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( NCT06236139 ) and these studies support future clinical translation of STEAP1 CAR T cell therapy for relapsed/refractory EwS.",background ewe sarcoma ew highli aggress cancer driven ewsfli1 fusion oncoprotein affect children adolesc young adult six transmembran epitheli antigen 1 steap1 cell surfac antigen transcript control ewsfli1 broadli express ew posit ration immunotherapi target howev translat car therapi solid tumor requir overcom barrier potenc maintain safeti method analys transcriptom proteom data perform evalu effect ewsfli1 perturb steap1 express transcript protein level ew model steap1 express valid ew patient tissu immunohistochemistri secondgener steap1bbzeta car cell test orthotop dissemin ew xenograft model enhanc antitumor activ il18armor steap1 car engin dosedepend therapeut efficaci safeti evalu measur tumor burden surviv observ gross toxic result steap1 express approxim 97 primari ew tumor directli associ ewsfli1 fusion protein express ew cell line orthotop ew model steap1 car cell induc complet tumor regress 5 x 10 6 cell dissemin diseas model respons dosedepend evid antigen loss notabl il18 armor steap1 car cell achiev complet respons approxim 80 mice reduc dose 10 6 cell without overt toxic conclus data establish steap1 clinic relev highli express target ew demonstr il18 armor significantli improv car cell efficaci enhanc potenc evid antitumor activ reduc cell dose steap1 car cell current evalu firstinhuman phase 12 doseescal clinic trial metastat castrationresist prostat cancer nct06236139 studi support futur clinic translat steap1 car cell therapi relapsedrefractori ew
cancer,"Manufacturing clinical grade mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) remains a major bottleneck for cell-based therapies, as extensive in-vitro expansion on standard tissue-culture plastic (TCP) drives loss of stemness, reduced immunomodulatory activity, and diminished therapeutic efficacy. Although substrate stiffness is known to influence MSC fate through mechanotransduction, the epigenetic mechanisms linking mechanical stress to progressive phenotypic drift remain poorly defined. A mechano-epigenetic pathway is identified in this work, centered on the histone methyltransferase EZH2 - that governs chromatin remodeling and loss of stemness during serial passaging. Multi-omics, high-resolution imaging, and functional assays show that MSCs expanded on mechanically stiff TCP accumulate H3K27me3 repressive chromatin mark, lose SWI/SNF -ARID1A chromatin- remodeling foci, and exhibit an altered chromatin accessibility profile. Pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 with GSK343 selectively reduced H3K27me3, restored ARID1A-containing SWI/SNF organization, and preserved MSC morphology and expression of canonical stemness markers (CD73, CD90, CD105) even at later passage. ATAC-seq analysis revealed that GSK343 rebalanced chromatin accessibility, reopening TEAD/YAP-responsive regulatory regions while repressing accessibility at lineage- priming and senescence-associated sites. RNA-seq demonstrated that GSK343 maintained transcriptional programs associated with immunomodulation, migration, and trophic signaling, while suppressing hyperproliferative and senescence-associated genes that are characteristic of late-passage MSCs. Proteomic profiling of MSC secretomes further showed that GSK343 attenuated pro-fibrotic ECM factors and senescence- linked proteins while enhancing angiogenic and reparative mediators. Functionally, conditioned media from GSK343-treated MSCs significantly increased primary chondrocyte proliferation, demonstrating preserved therapeutic potency. Together, these findings establish EZH2 as a central mediator of stiffness-induced epigenetic drift in human MSCs and demonstrate that EZH2 inhibition can maintain the stemness without compromising their expansion ability. This work provides a foundational strategy for mechano-epigenetic engineering of MSCs and highlights EZH2 inhibition as a scalable, manufacturing-compatible approach to preserve potency for regenerative medicine applications. SIGNIFIANCE STATEMENT: Primary mesenchymal stem/ stromal cells (MSC) derived from bone marrow are currently under numerous clinical trials for regenerative medicine and cancer treatment. Despite showing tremendous potential for their differentiation, trophic and immunomodulatory properties, their efficacy in clinical endpoint is limited. The traditional cell culture condition in cell culture flask limits their clinical translation by changing the MSC phenotype with serial passaging, a critical step required for harvesting a clinically appropriate number of cells. This work discovered the precise epigenetic mechanism involving histone methylation responsible for such changes in MSC phenotype. By inhibiting the histone methylation by GSK343, this study showed that MSC phenotype can be maintained over serial passaging as demonstrated by microscopy, multi-omics, and in vitro functional assays.",manufactur clinic grade mesenchym stromal cell msc remain major bottleneck cellbas therapi extens invitro expans standard tissuecultur plastic tcp drive loss stem reduc immunomodulatori activ diminish therapeut efficaci although substrat stiff known influenc msc fate mechanotransduct epigenet mechan link mechan stress progress phenotyp drift remain poorli defin mechanoepigenet pathway identifi work center histon methyltransferas ezh2 govern chromatin remodel loss stem serial passag multiom highresolut imag function assay show msc expand mechan stiff tcp accumul h3k27me3 repress chromatin mark lose swisnf arid1a chromatin remodel foci exhibit alter chromatin access profil pharmacolog inhibit ezh2 gsk343 select reduc h3k27me3 restor arid1acontain swisnf organ preserv msc morpholog express canon stem marker cd73 cd90 cd105 even later passag atacseq analysi reveal gsk343 rebalanc chromatin access reopen teadyaprespons regulatori region repress access lineag prime senescenceassoci site rnaseq demonstr gsk343 maintain transcript program associ immunomodul migrat trophic signal suppress hyperprolif senescenceassoci gene characterist latepassag msc proteom profil msc secretom show gsk343 attenu profibrot ecm factor senesc link protein enhanc angiogen repar mediat function condit media gsk343treat msc significantli increas primari chondrocyt prolifer demonstr preserv therapeut potenc togeth find establish ezh2 central mediat stiffnessinduc epigenet drift human msc demonstr ezh2 inhibit maintain stem without compromis expans abil work provid foundat strategi mechanoepigenet engin msc highlight ezh2 inhibit scalabl manufacturingcompat approach preserv potenc regen medicin applic signifi statement primari mesenchym stem stromal cell msc deriv bone marrow current numer clinic trial regen medicin cancer treatment despit show tremend potenti differenti trophic immunomodulatori properti efficaci clinic endpoint limit tradit cell cultur condit cell cultur flask limit clinic translat chang msc phenotyp serial passag critic step requir harvest clinic appropri number cell work discov precis epigenet mechan involv histon methyl respons chang msc phenotyp inhibit histon methyl gsk343 studi show msc phenotyp maintain serial passag demonstr microscopi multiom vitro function assay
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the temporal trends and turning points of thyroid cancer burden in China from 1990 to 2021 and project future incidence and mortality to 2035. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Data were sourced from the Global Burden of Disease 2021 database. METHODS: Temporal trends were evaluated using Joinpoint regression, and associations between cancer burden and sociodemographic indices were explored through frontier analysis. A Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort model was applied to project future disease burden through 2035. RESULTS: In 2021, China reported 48,104 new thyroid cancer cases and 7692 deaths. From 1990 to 2021, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and prevalence rate (ASPR) increased markedly (average annual percentage change [AAPC]: 2.98% and 2.25%, respectively), whereas the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and disability-adjusted life year rate (ASDR) declined (AAPC: -0.65% and -0.56%). A pivotal shift occurred around 2005: while ASMR and ASDR continued to decrease in both China and globally, China's ASIR and ASPR accelerated further, contrasting with a global deceleration. Projections indicate that China's ASIR for thyroid cancer is expected to increase more rapidly than the global average over the next 15 years. CONCLUSION: The thyroid cancer burden in China is characterized by rapidly rising incidence and stagnating mortality decline, a pattern distinct from global trends and likely driven by intensified detection. This escalating burden necessitates public health strategies focused on optimizing screening practices and managing overdiagnosis.",object analyz tempor trend turn point thyroid cancer burden china 1990 2021 project futur incid mortal 2035 studi design crosssect studi set data sourc global burden diseas 2021 databas method tempor trend evalu use joinpoint regress associ cancer burden sociodemograph indic explor frontier analysi bayesian ageperiodcohort model appli project futur diseas burden 2035 result 2021 china report 48104 new thyroid cancer case 7692 death 1990 2021 agestandard incid rate asir preval rate aspr increas markedli averag annual percentag chang aapc 298 225 respect wherea agestandard mortal rate asmr disabilityadjust life year rate asdr declin aapc 065 056 pivot shift occur around 2005 asmr asdr continu decreas china global china asir aspr acceler contrast global deceler project indic china asir thyroid cancer expect increas rapidli global averag next 15 year conclus thyroid cancer burden china character rapidli rise incid stagnat mortal declin pattern distinct global trend like driven intensifi detect escal burden necessit public health strategi focus optim screen practic manag overdiagnosi
cancer,"Many breast cancer survivors are prescribed daily oral medications called endocrine therapy that prevent cancer recurrence. Despite its clinical importance, maintaining consistent daily adherence remains challenging due to the dynamic and interrelated influences of behavioral, physiological, and psychological factors. While prior studies have explored adherence prediction using mobile sensing, they often rely on single-modality data, limited temporal granularity, or aggregate-level modeling-limiting their ability to capture short and long-term behavioral variability and to facilitate deeper understanding of non-adherence and tailored interventions. To address these gaps, we propose a multimodal sensing framework that explicitly models daily adherence dynamics using temporally adaptive inputs. We recruited a sample of breast cancer survivors (N = 20) and collected longitudinal data streams including wearable-derived physiological features (Fitbit), medication event monitoring system (MEMS) data, and ecological momentary assessments (EMAs). Using multimodal data across varying time windows, we examined whether recent patterns in behavioral, physiological, psychological, and environmental factors improve the prediction of next-day endocrine therapy adherence. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using multimodal sensing data to predict daily adherence with moderate accuracy. Moreover, models integrating multimodal data consistently outperformed those relying on a single modality. Importantly, we observed that the predictive value of each modality varied depending on the temporal proximity of the input signals, underscoring the importance of modeling immediate and longer-term behavioral patterns. The findings offer valuable insights for advancing adherence monitoring systems, suggesting that incorporating personalized and temporally adaptive data fusion strategies may significantly enhance the effectiveness of intervention design and delivery.",mani breast cancer survivor prescrib daili oral medic call endocrin therapi prevent cancer recurr despit clinic import maintain consist daili adher remain challeng due dynam interrel influenc behavior physiolog psycholog factor prior studi explor adher predict use mobil sens often reli singlemod data limit tempor granular aggregatelevel modelinglimit abil captur short longterm behavior variabl facilit deeper understand nonadher tailor intervent address gap propos multimod sens framework explicitli model daili adher dynam use tempor adapt input recruit sampl breast cancer survivor n 20 collect longitudin data stream includ wearablederiv physiolog featur fitbit medic event monitor system mem data ecolog momentari assess ema use multimod data across vari time window examin whether recent pattern behavior physiolog psycholog environment factor improv predict nextday endocrin therapi adher result demonstr feasibl use multimod sens data predict daili adher moder accuraci moreov model integr multimod data consist outperform reli singl modal importantli observ predict valu modal vari depend tempor proxim input signal underscor import model immedi longerterm behavior pattern find offer valuabl insight advanc adher monitor system suggest incorpor person tempor adapt data fusion strategi may significantli enhanc effect intervent design deliveri
cancer,"Oxidative DNA damage is a major driver of genome instability and human disease. Among the various types of oxidative DNA base lesions, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8oxoG) is particularly prevalent due to guanine's low oxidation potential and the abundance of guanine-rich (G-rich) sequences across the genome. Structure-forming repeat sequences, which are commonly G-rich, can adopt alternative DNA secondary structures that further expose nucleobases to oxidative damage. The base excision repair (BER) pathway is primarily responsible for the repair of 8oxoG lesions; however, the complex topologies and dynamic conformations formed by these repeat sequences present challenges for complete repair. Inefficient BER within these structures can lead to DNA strand breaks, mutations, and large chromosomal rearrangements, all of which are associated with human disease. Notably, structure-forming repeat sequences are often enriched at regulatory genomic regions, where BER can directly influence processes such as replication and transcription. This review summarizes current insights into BER activity within oxidatively damaged structure-forming repeat sequences and highlights how repair efficiency within these sequences impacts genome stability and disease.",oxid dna damag major driver genom instabl human diseas among variou type oxid dna base lesion 8oxo78dihydroguanin 8oxog particularli preval due guanin low oxid potenti abund guaninerich grich sequenc across genom structureform repeat sequenc commonli grich adopt altern dna secondari structur expos nucleobas oxid damag base excis repair ber pathway primarili respons repair 8oxog lesion howev complex topolog dynam conform form repeat sequenc present challeng complet repair ineffici ber within structur lead dna strand break mutat larg chromosom rearrang associ human diseas notabl structureform repeat sequenc often enrich regulatori genom region ber directli influenc process replic transcript review summar current insight ber activ within oxid damag structureform repeat sequenc highlight repair effici within sequenc impact genom stabil diseas
cancer,"BACKGROUND: CD47 is a ""don't eat me"" signal that is overexpressed in tumors to evade phagocytosis by tumor associated macrophages (TAM). Investigational agents targeting CD47, such as magrolimab, aim to induce phagocytosis of tumor cells by TAMs. Previously, two key TAM subsets have been identified: C1QC TAMs, which display pro-phagocytic activity, and SPP1 TAMs that express pro-angiogenic markers. We characterize CD47 expression and its relationship with tumor macrophages in solid tumor samples. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Resectable tumors from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (n=36) (HNSCC), breast cancer (n=37) (BC), and colorectal cancer (n=36) (CRC) were evaluated for CD47 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), two multiplex immunofluorescence panels were used to characterize TAM markers and T cell markers. RNA sequencing was also performed. RESULTS: CD47 protein expression was higher on tumor cells compared to stromal cells across tumor indications tested. Although CRC had the lowest prevalence for CD47 expression in primary tumors, we observed a marked increase in CD47 expression in CRC liver metastases. We developed an SPP1 TAM gene signature and validated a C1QC TAM gene signature to estimate TAM abundances from bulk RNA-Seq data. In the TAM mIF analysis, HNSCC had the highest macrophage density of the indications tested. We observed a positive correlation between a higher C1QC: SPP1 TAM ratio and macrophage phenotype and tumor T cell density. C1QC macrophage signatures correlate with tumor CD47 protein expression in BC and HNSCC samples, suggesting interplay between them. CONCLUSIONS: We characterized CD47 expression across key solid tumor indications being evaluated clinically using anti-CD47 blockade agents: HNSCC, breast cancer and CRC. Using a CD47 IHC assay, we identified HNSCC as an indication with the highest CD47 expression. In addition, we quantified tumor macrophages using multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) and determined that HNSCC had the highest density of TAMs. Compared to relatively low CD47 expression in primary CRC tumors, CRC liver metastases had very high CD47 expression. Quantification of TAM signatures and CD47 expression represent key biomarkers to monitor in patient samples during exploration of CD47-blockade agents in the clinic.",background cd47 dont eat signal overexpress tumor evad phagocytosi tumor associ macrophag tam investig agent target cd47 magrolimab aim induc phagocytosi tumor cell tam previous two key tam subset identifi c1qc tam display prophagocyt activ spp1 tam express proangiogen marker character cd47 express relationship tumor macrophag solid tumor sampl patient method resect tumor head neck squamou cell carcinoma n36 hnscc breast cancer n37 bc colorect cancer n36 crc evalu cd47 express immunohistochemistri ihc two multiplex immunofluoresc panel use character tam marker cell marker rna sequenc also perform result cd47 protein express higher tumor cell compar stromal cell across tumor indic test although crc lowest preval cd47 express primari tumor observ mark increas cd47 express crc liver metastas develop spp1 tam gene signatur valid c1qc tam gene signatur estim tam abund bulk rnaseq data tam mif analysi hnscc highest macrophag densiti indic test observ posit correl higher c1qc spp1 tam ratio macrophag phenotyp tumor cell densiti c1qc macrophag signatur correl tumor cd47 protein express bc hnscc sampl suggest interplay conclus character cd47 express across key solid tumor indic evalu clinic use anticd47 blockad agent hnscc breast cancer crc use cd47 ihc assay identifi hnscc indic highest cd47 express addit quantifi tumor macrophag use multiplex immunofluoresc mif determin hnscc highest densiti tam compar rel low cd47 express primari crc tumor crc liver metastas high cd47 express quantif tam signatur cd47 express repres key biomark monitor patient sampl explor cd47blockad agent clinic
cancer,"This article thoroughly explores the crucial role of T cell exhaustion in the process of tumor immune escape, comprehensively explaining its key characteristics, such as dynamic plasticity, heterogeneity, and epigenetic reprogramming. The article first elaborates on the complex interaction between immune surveillance and tumor escape, and then clarifies the core position of T cells in anti-tumor immunity and the evolution of the ""exhaustion"" concept, covering various research fields from chronic infections to the tumor microenvironment (TME). It provides a detailed analysis of the origin, differentiation pathways, and dynamic plasticity of exhausted T cells, revealing the possibility of functional recovery under specific conditions. At the same time, the article analyzes the profound influence of various factors in the TME (such as metabolic stress, immune suppression networks, and stromal interaction interfaces) on the process of T cell exhaustion. It conducts in-depth research on the molecular characteristics of exhausted T cells (including surface marker characteristics, transcriptional regulatory networks, and metabolic reprogramming characteristics), providing potential therapeutic targets for precision medicine. In the clinical translation aspect, this study clarifies the cutting-edge exploration achievements of diagnostic biomarkers, such as the exhausted subtypes defined by single-cell multi-omics technology, the prognostic value of TCR clonal dynamics, and the innovation of treatment strategies, including the ""re-mobilization window"" theory in PD-1 blockade, the synergistic effect of epigenetic drugs, the temporal and spatial selection in metabolic intervention, and the application of engineered cell therapies.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Malignant ascites in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) represent a fluid extension of the tumor microenvironment, embedding immune programs that may inform prognosis and treatment response. We investigated whether ascitic T-cell phenotypes, integrated with clinical variables, improve prediction of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), progression-free interval (PFI), and platinum-based drug chemotherapy resistance (P-DCR). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 87 patients with FIGO III/IV HGSOC with treatment-naive ascites treated at Peking University Third Hospital (May 2019-Mar 2024; median follow-up, 33 months). Ascites (>1,000 mL) underwent standardized processing and multiparametric flow cytometry to quantify T-cell subsets. To prevent information leakage, we used repeated nested cross-validation with event-stratified folds: inner folds performed endpoint-specific screening with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control, redundancy reduction, and multicollinearity checks; clinical covariates were added by incremental contribution testing. Cox proportional hazards, Random Survival Forests (RSFs), and DeepSurv modeled survival endpoints; a random-forest classifier modeled P-DCR. Performance was summarized on outer folds [C-index for survival; receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve (ROC-AUC) for P-DCR]. Model interpretability used Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). RESULTS: Across endpoints, combined clinical + ascites features outperformed single-source features, with RSF consistently best. Outer-fold testing C-indices for RSF with combined features were 0.72 (OS), 0.70 (PFS), and 0.74 (PFI). The P-DCR classifier achieved a mean AUC of 0.69 with combined features (accuracy, 0.66; sensitivity, 0.70; specificity, 0.62). Feature-count sensitivity analyses showed performance gains plateauing at modest k ( approximately 5-7). Kaplan-Meier curves derived from combined-feature risk scores demonstrated clear stratification. SHAP analyses indicated protective effects of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor maintenance across endpoints, while ascitic T-cell subsets, including PD-1(+)CD57(+)CD4(+) and CCR7(-)CD45RA(+)CD4(+) populations, were repeatedly associated with higher risk; age contributed strongly to PFI. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating ascitic immunophenotyping with clinical factors improves risk prediction in HGSOC, with RSF offering robust performance under rigorous, leakage-safe validation. Ascites-resident T-cell states provide complementary, reproducible prognostic signals for survival and platinum response, supporting their potential utility for patient stratification and hypothesis generation for immunomodulatory strategies.",background malign ascit highgrad serou ovarian cancer hgsoc repres fluid extens tumor microenviron embed immun program may inform prognosi treatment respons investig whether ascit tcell phenotyp integr clinic variabl improv predict overal surviv os progressionfre surviv pf progressionfre interv pfi platinumbas drug chemotherapi resist pdcr method retrospect analyz 87 patient figo iiiiv hgsoc treatmentna ascit treat peke univers third hospit may 2019mar 2024 median followup 33 month ascit 1000 ml underw standard process multiparametr flow cytometri quantifi tcell subset prevent inform leakag use repeat nest crossvalid eventstratifi fold inner fold perform endpointspecif screen benjaminihochberg fdr control redund reduct multicollinear check clinic covari ad increment contribut test cox proport hazard random surviv forest rsf deepsurv model surviv endpoint randomforest classifi model pdcr perform summar outer fold cindex surviv receiv oper characteristicarea curv rocauc pdcr model interpret use shapley addit explan shap result across endpoint combin clinic ascit featur outperform singlesourc featur rsf consist best outerfold test cindic rsf combin featur 072 os 070 pf 074 pfi pdcr classifi achiev mean auc 069 combin featur accuraci 066 sensit 070 specif 062 featurecount sensit analys show perform gain plateau modest k approxim 57 kaplanmei curv deriv combinedfeatur risk score demonstr clear stratif shap analys indic protect effect polyadpribos polymeras parp inhibitor mainten across endpoint ascit tcell subset includ pd1cd57cd4 ccr7cd45racd4 popul repeatedli associ higher risk age contribut strongli pfi conclus integr ascit immunophenotyp clinic factor improv risk predict hgsoc rsf offer robust perform rigor leakagesaf valid ascitesresid tcell state provid complementari reproduc prognost signal surviv platinum respons support potenti util patient stratif hypothesi gener immunomodulatori strategi
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain metastasis (BM) and negative driver genes. METHODS: This observational prospective study was conducted using the clinical data of 34 patients with NSCLC and BM, including 24 patients who received immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic therapy and 10 control patients using oral anlotinib upon the first- to fourth-line treatment failure or refusing to continue chemotherapy between June 2017 and August 2022. Efficacy was evaluated using progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and adverse reactions. RESULTS: Among 24 patients treated with immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic therapy, 17 had a partial response, six had stable disease, and one had progressive disease. The ORR and DCR of patients receiving immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic therapy were 70.8% and 95.8%, respectively. The median PFS of immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic treatment was significantly longer than that of oral anlotinib (18.0 vs. 4 months, log-rank test, p < 0.0001), indicating that immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic therapy can substantially improve the treatment efficacy for NSCLC with BM and negative driver genes. Adverse reactions mainly included rash in one case and hypothyroidism in one case, but did not involve myocardial damage or liver and kidney function damage. CONCLUSION: Immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic therapy in patients with recurrent or refractory NSCLC and BM driven by negative genes has yielded promising but preliminary findings.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) ranks among the most prevalent malignant tumors in women globally, with mitochondrial dysfunction constituting one of its pathogenic mechanisms. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between mitochondrial function-related genes and BC progression. METHODS: We identified BC differentially expressed genes via the GEO database, constructed a weighted co-expression network to determine BC pathogenesis-related key modules. Using 113 machine learning algorithms and MitoCarta mitochondrial genetics data, we developed a mitochondrial gene-based diagnostic model. GO/KEGG enrichment analyses delineated BC-related biological processes of mitochondrial genes, offering clues for understanding BC mechanism. High-throughput tissue chip and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) validated key genes' local expression in tissues. CiberSort immune infiltration analysis highlighted NK and T cells' role in BC; single-cell analysis identified gene expression patterns across tumor microenvironment cell types. Computational drug prediction and molecular docking explored targeted therapeutic candidates. Additionally, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations. RESULTS: The glmBoost+LDA model had the highest C-index (0.947) in the validated cohort, including 18 potential BC biomarkers (e.g., ACADS, AUC = 0.810; AIFM2, AUC = 0.806). The results of experimental validation showed that the expression score of ACADS in cancerous tissues was significantly lower than that in adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Immune infiltration and single-cell analyses emphasized the crucial roles of NK cells and T cells in BC. Disulfiram and eugenol were predicted as potential therapeutics and validated by docking.

cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease, and the tumor microenvironment (TME) characteristics are closely related to disease progression and treatment outcomes. We elucidated the cell type-specific transcriptome landscape of cancer cells and the effect of the TME on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing of the LUAD tissues and matched adjacent normal tissues of three patients in the early-stage via histopathological and immunohistochemical confirmation. RESULTS: The results revealed the landscape of 68,579 cells in LUAD microenvironment, and highly heterogeneous AT2 cells are crucial source of lung epithelial cell carcinogenesis. Genes KRT81, SPP1, PCDH7, SLC2A1, and TET1 were significantly upregulated in tumor tissues and associated with poor prognosis and survival, providing insights for exploring lung cancer biomarkers in future studies. Trajectory analysis identified ERBB4, SEMA4A, GCNT2 and SOX4 as key factors in AT2 cells that may promote cell proliferation, migration, or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during the progression of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We elucidated the transcription factor-target gene regulatory network involving NKX2-1 and TEAD1 in malignant tumor cells derived from AT2 cells. The findings indicated that malignant AT2 cells regulate communication between epithelial and immune cells in the TME by predicted FN1-CD44 and CADM1-CADM1 ligand-receptor interactions, which ultimately suppresses the host immune response. DISCUSSION: This comprehensive single-cell analysis increases our understanding of AT2 cells molecular and dynamics of metastatic lung cancer. In summary, single-cell RNA profiling of LUAD offers valuable prognostic insights based on AT2 cell types and identifies potential biomarkers for therapeutic responses, aiding the future development of LUAD treatment strategies.",introduct lung cancer highli heterogen diseas tumor microenviron tme characterist close relat diseas progress treatment outcom elucid cell typespecif transcriptom landscap cancer cell effect tme lung adenocarcinoma luad method singlecel rna sequenc luad tissu match adjac normal tissu three patient earlystag via histopatholog immunohistochem confirm result result reveal landscap 68579 cell luad microenviron highli heterogen at2 cell crucial sourc lung epitheli cell carcinogenesi gene krt81 spp1 pcdh7 slc2a1 tet1 significantli upregul tumor tissu associ poor prognosi surviv provid insight explor lung cancer biomark futur studi trajectori analysi identifi erbb4 sema4a gcnt2 sox4 key factor at2 cell may promot cell prolifer migrat epithelialmesenchym transit emt progress lung adenocarcinoma luad elucid transcript factortarget gene regulatori network involv nkx21 tead1 malign tumor cell deriv at2 cell find indic malign at2 cell regul commun epitheli immun cell tme predict fn1cd44 cadm1cadm1 ligandreceptor interact ultim suppress host immun respons discuss comprehens singlecel analysi increas understand at2 cell molecular dynam metastat lung cancer summari singlecel rna profil luad offer valuabl prognost insight base at2 cell type identifi potenti biomark therapeut respons aid futur develop luad treatment strategi
cancer,"Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly malignant neuroendocrine tumor characterized by rapid proliferation and dismal prognosis. Platinum-based chemotherapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is now the first-line treatment for extensive-stage disease (ES-SCLC), extending the overall survival (OS) period of these patients by 2-5 months, yet durable remissions remain the privilege of fewer than 20% of patients. Despite intensive investigation, this incremental benefit appears to have plateaued, prompting exploration of alternative combination strategies to unleash deeper and more durable antitumor synergy. Recent phase II/III trials integrating anti-angiogenic agents into the chemo-immunotherapy have reported unprecedented OS gains of up to 7 months, redefining therapeutic expectations. Concurrently, chemoradiation with ICIs triplet regimens have demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity in ES-SCLC, while rational combinations of small-molecule targeted drugs (DLL3 inhibitors, PARP inhibitors) combined with ICIs or epigenetic modifiers with ICIs are yielding early signals of efficacy. Nevertheless, primary resistance, absence of robust predictive biomarkers, and cumulative toxicity continue to curtail clinical impact. This Review provides a comprehensive, evidence-based map of the evolving ES-SCLC immunotherapy combination landscape. We critically dissect competing therapeutic paradigms, juxtapose corroborative and contradictory data, and distill actionable insights for future trial design, biomarker development, and regulatory strategy.",smallcel lung cancer sclc highli malign neuroendocrin tumor character rapid prolifer dismal prognosi platinumbas chemotherapi combin immun checkpoint inhibitor ici firstlin treatment extensivestag diseas essclc extend overal surviv os period patient 25 month yet durabl remiss remain privileg fewer 20 patient despit intens investig increment benefit appear plateau prompt explor altern combin strategi unleash deeper durabl antitumor synergi recent phase iiiii trial integr antiangiogen agent chemoimmunotherapi report unpreced os gain 7 month redefin therapeut expect concurr chemoradi ici triplet regimen demonstr encourag antitumor activ essclc ration combin smallmolecul target drug dll3 inhibitor parp inhibitor combin ici epigenet modifi ici yield earli signal efficaci nevertheless primari resist absenc robust predict biomark cumul toxic continu curtail clinic impact review provid comprehens evidencebas map evolv essclc immunotherapi combin landscap critic dissect compet therapeut paradigm juxtapos corrobor contradictori data distil action insight futur trial design biomark develop regulatori strategi
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer poses a severe threat owing to its high morbidity and mortality rates, which are largely attributed to drug resistance. Therefore, novel therapeutic targets need to be identified. Pyroptosis is an inflammatory cell death process mediated by gasdermin (GSDM) and dependent on caspases. Moreover, pyroptosis plays a role in regulating tumor progression and response to therapy. Furthermore, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) is a glucose analogue that confers anticancer effects via metabolic interference. However, its mechanism of action in breast cancer remains unclear. METHODS: To explore the effect of 2-DG on pyroptosis in EMT6/4T1 breast cancer cells, cell viability assays, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation, and morphological analyses were performed. For in vivo studies, antitumor effects of 2-DG were assessed using xenograft models, and its safety was evaluated by monitoring body weight and conducting histological analysis. RESULTS: 2-DG induced cytotoxicity and pyroptosis in EMT6/4T1 breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, 2-DG activated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) signalling, suppressed hexokinase 2 (HK2), and triggered caspase-3/GSDME-dependent pyroptosis. In vivo experiments demonstrated that 2-DG inhibited breast tumor growth without causing severe toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings identified a novel metabolic-inflammatory axis (cAMP/PKA-HK2-caspase-3/GSDME) in breast cancer. Furthermore, study highlights the in vivo efficacy and safety of 2-DG and its ability to induce pyroptosis, thereby providing a basis for targeting drug resistance in breast cancer.",background breast cancer pose sever threat owe high morbid mortal rate larg attribut drug resist therefor novel therapeut target need identifi pyroptosi inflammatori cell death process mediat gasdermin gsdm depend caspas moreov pyroptosi play role regul tumor progress respons therapi furthermor 2deoxydglucos 2dg glucos analogu confer anticanc effect via metabol interfer howev mechan action breast cancer remain unclear method explor effect 2dg pyroptosi emt64t1 breast cancer cell cell viabil assay immunoblot immunofluoresc coimmunoprecipit morpholog analys perform vivo studi antitumor effect 2dg assess use xenograft model safeti evalu monitor bodi weight conduct histolog analysi result 2dg induc cytotox pyroptosi emt64t1 breast cancer cell mechanist 2dg activ cyclic adenosin monophosph campprotein kinas pka signal suppress hexokinas 2 hk2 trigger caspase3gsdmedepend pyroptosi vivo experi demonstr 2dg inhibit breast tumor growth without caus sever toxic conclus find identifi novel metabolicinflammatori axi camppkahk2caspase3gsdm breast cancer furthermor studi highlight vivo efficaci safeti 2dg abil induc pyroptosi therebi provid basi target drug resist breast cancer
cancer,"The circadian clock exerts profound regulatory control over adaptive immunity, particularly affecting T and B lymphocyte development, trafficking, activation, and effector function. These immune cells possess autonomous molecular clocks governed by core genes such as Bmal1, Clock, Per1/2, and Cry1/2, which influence transcriptional programs related to receptor expression, cytokine signaling, and metabolism. Circadian regulation shapes the daily oscillation of lymphocyte recirculation through lymphoid organs, modulates antigen responsiveness, and fine-tunes subset differentiation-most notably skewing CD4(+) T cell fate toward Th1, Th2, Th17, or Treg lineages depending on time-of-day-linked signaling cascades such as mTOR/Akt and RORgammat/Nfil3 pathways. Similarly, rhythmic glucocorticoid and catecholamine signaling synchronize peripheral lymphocyte clocks with systemic cues, integrating hormonal and environmental information. Clinically, circadian disruption - whether through genetic mutations, shift work, or chronic stress - has been linked to aberrant lymphocyte function, increased autoimmunity, impaired vaccine responses, and reduced immunosurveillance in cancer. Recent findings demonstrate that time-of-day-dependent administration of vaccines and immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitors, can significantly influence clinical efficacy and immune outcomes. Understanding the temporal orchestration of adaptive immunity thus holds translational potential for optimizing therapeutic strategies, including chronotherapy and vaccination scheduling.",circadian clock exert profound regulatori control adapt immun particularli affect b lymphocyt develop traffick activ effector function immun cell possess autonom molecular clock govern core gene bmal1 clock per12 cry12 influenc transcript program relat receptor express cytokin signal metabol circadian regul shape daili oscil lymphocyt recircul lymphoid organ modul antigen respons finetun subset differentiationmost notabl skew cd4 cell fate toward th1 th2 th17 treg lineag depend timeofdaylink signal cascad mtorakt rorgammatnfil3 pathway similarli rhythmic glucocorticoid catecholamin signal synchron peripher lymphocyt clock system cue integr hormon environment inform clinic circadian disrupt whether genet mutat shift work chronic stress link aberr lymphocyt function increas autoimmun impair vaccin respons reduc immunosurveil cancer recent find demonstr timeofdaydepend administr vaccin immunotherapi includ checkpoint inhibitor significantli influenc clinic efficaci immun outcom understand tempor orchestr adapt immun thu hold translat potenti optim therapeut strategi includ chronotherapi vaccin schedul
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) have recently emerged as critical regulators in cancer biology; yet their expression profiles and clinical relevance in multiple myeloma (MM) remain poorly defined. METHODS: High-throughput sequencing was performed to comprehensively characterize tsRNA expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 22 newly diagnosed MM patients and 19 healthy controls. Shared target genes were predicted by integrating miRanda and TargetScan, and a tsRNA-mRNA interaction network was constructed; GO and KEGG functional enrichment analyses were also performed. The discriminative performance of candidate biomarkers was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and the associations between candidate tsRNAs and clinical parameters were further examined by correlation analyses. RESULTS: A total of 148 significantly upregulated and 63 downregulated tsRNAs were identified. Among them, Other-1_19-tRNA-SeC-TCA-1 and Other-36_54-tRNA-Met-CAT-2-M4 exhibited excellent diagnostic performance, with areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of 0.9557 and 0.9773, respectively. Functional analyses revealed that differentially expressed tsRNAs were primarily involved in regulating signaling pathways such as TGF-beta, PI3K-Akt, and AMPK, and were closely associated with thyroid hormone metabolism. Elevated expression of Other-22_52-tRNA-Gly-GCC-1-M3 was significantly correlated with renal insufficiency (p < 0.05), suggesting its potential as a novel biomarker for assessing renal injury risk. The tsRNA-mRNA regulatory network comprised 11,141 interaction edges and exhibited a power-law topology, with the hub gene SRSF10 mediating coordinated regulation across multiple pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal a distinct imbalance in tsRNA expression in MM, indicating that specific tsRNA fragments contribute to disease progression and renal injury through multifaceted signaling networks, thereby providing novel molecular insights for early diagnosis and risk stratification.",background transfer rnaderiv small rna tsrna recent emerg critic regul cancer biolog yet express profil clinic relev multipl myeloma mm remain poorli defin method highthroughput sequenc perform comprehens character tsrna express profil peripher blood mononuclear cell pbmc 22 newli diagnos mm patient 19 healthi control share target gene predict integr miranda targetscan tsrnamrna interact network construct go kegg function enrich analys also perform discrimin perform candid biomark evalu use receiv oper characterist roc curv associ candid tsrna clinic paramet examin correl analys result total 148 significantli upregul 63 downregul tsrna identifi among other119trnasectca1 other3654trnametcat2m4 exhibit excel diagnost perform area roc curv auc 09557 09773 respect function analys reveal differenti express tsrna primarili involv regul signal pathway tgfbeta pi3kakt ampk close associ thyroid hormon metabol elev express other2252trnaglygcc1m3 significantli correl renal insuffici p 005 suggest potenti novel biomark assess renal injuri risk tsrnamrna regulatori network compris 11141 interact edg exhibit powerlaw topolog hub gene srsf10 mediat coordin regul across multipl pathway conclus find reveal distinct imbal tsrna express mm indic specif tsrna fragment contribut diseas progress renal injuri multifacet signal network therebi provid novel molecular insight earli diagnosi risk stratif
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Solid cancer patients are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 and may benefit from repeated booster doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. Beyond neutralizing antibody titers, recent evidence highlights the induction of spike-specific IgG4 after multiple vaccine doses, a phenomenon potentially linked to immune tolerance. METHODS: We investigated the humoral response following the administration of the fourth and fifth dose of the Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 mRNA vaccine in 48 patients with solid tumors undergoing active or recent anticancer treatment, compared with age-matched controls (n=24). Serum samples were collected before (T1) and three weeks after vaccination (T2). IgG against the spike receptor-binding-domain (IgG-RBD-S), spike-specific IgM (IgM-S), and IgG4 (IgG4-S) were quantified using standardized assays. RESULTS: Booster vaccination induced a robust increase in neutralizing IgG-RBD-S, with a median 4.6-fold rise at T2 (9568.9 vs. 2086.4 BAU/mL). Notably, high baseline titers at T1 confirmed antibody persistence at about one year after the third dose. IgG-RBD-S levels were higher in patients receiving the fifth compared to the fourth dose, supporting a cumulative dose-dependent effect. IgM-S positivity correlated with significantly stronger neutralizing responses. IgG4-S significantly increased post-vaccination (8.7 to 28.3 ng/mL), but no differences were observed between cancer patients and controls, nor between the fourth and fifth dose, suggesting a lack of further IgG4 accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated booster doses elicit strong and durable neutralizing antibody responses in solid cancer patients. It seems that variant-adapted formulations may mitigate IgG4 accumulation, thus ideally moderating tolerance associated with IgG4 by introducing antigenic novelty. These findings support continued booster administration and monitoring of humoral responses in oncologic populations.",background solid cancer patient increas risk sever covid19 may benefit repeat booster dose sarscov2 mrna vaccin beyond neutral antibodi titer recent evid highlight induct spikespecif igg4 multipl vaccin dose phenomenon potenti link immun toler method investig humor respons follow administr fourth fifth dose comirnati omicron xbb15 mrna vaccin 48 patient solid tumor undergo activ recent anticanc treatment compar agematch control n24 serum sampl collect t1 three week vaccin t2 igg spike receptorbindingdomain iggrbd spikespecif igm igm igg4 igg4 quantifi use standard assay result booster vaccin induc robust increas neutral iggrbd median 46fold rise t2 95689 vs 20864 bauml notabl high baselin titer t1 confirm antibodi persist one year third dose iggrbd level higher patient receiv fifth compar fourth dose support cumul dosedepend effect igm posit correl significantli stronger neutral respons igg4 significantli increas postvaccin 87 283 ngml differ observ cancer patient control fourth fifth dose suggest lack igg4 accumul conclus repeat booster dose elicit strong durabl neutral antibodi respons solid cancer patient seem variantadapt formul may mitig igg4 accumul thu ideal moder toler associ igg4 introduc antigen novelti find support continu booster administr monitor humor respons oncolog popul
cancer,"OBJECTIVES: With the increasing application of high-throughput transcriptomic data in cancer research, identifying reliable cancer biomarkers in high-dimensional settings remains a major challenge. This study aims to systematically evaluate various regularized conditional logistic regression (CLR) methods under a matched case-control (MCC) design, focusing on their performance in variable selection, parameter estimation, and predictive accuracy. Special emphasis is placed on the importance of the matching design in reducing confounding effects and improving model interpretability. METHODS: We utilize RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), specifically datasets for liver, thyroid, and lung cancers, which include paired tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples. In our analysis, we apply 4 regularized CLR methods implemented in R packages-namely ""clogitL1,"" ""pclogit,"" ""clogitLasso,"" and ""penalizedclr""-to analyze over 20 000 gene expression features. We evaluate the comparative performance of these methods based on metrics such as gene selection stability, predictive accuracy, and interpretability. Additionally, we employ a bootstrap resampling framework to estimate gene selection probabilities, which serve as a measure of gene importance. RESULTS: Our results show that incorporating the MCC design significantly enhances feature selection performance by mitigating confounding noise. The regularized CLR models successfully identify several well-established cancer-related genes with high selection consistency and statistical significance. In contrast, models that ignore the matched design tend to miss critical biomarkers or produce excessive false positives, leading to potentially misleading interpretations. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the value of integrating a matched case-control design with regularized CLR methods for the analysis of high-dimensional transcriptomic data. The proposed analytical framework offers improved accuracy, robustness, and biological relevance, providing a practical and scalable approach for cancer genomics research. It also supports the advancement of precision medicine and translational applications.",object increas applic highthroughput transcriptom data cancer research identifi reliabl cancer biomark highdimension set remain major challeng studi aim systemat evalu variou regular condit logist regress clr method match casecontrol mcc design focus perform variabl select paramet estim predict accuraci special emphasi place import match design reduc confound effect improv model interpret method util rnaseq data cancer genom atla tcga specif dataset liver thyroid lung cancer includ pair tumor adjac normal tissu sampl analysi appli 4 regular clr method implement r packagesnam clogitl1 pclogit clogitlasso penalizedclrto analyz 20 000 gene express featur evalu compar perform method base metric gene select stabil predict accuraci interpret addit employ bootstrap resampl framework estim gene select probabl serv measur gene import result result show incorpor mcc design significantli enhanc featur select perform mitig confound nois regular clr model success identifi sever wellestablish cancerrel gene high select consist statist signific contrast model ignor match design tend miss critic biomark produc excess fals posit lead potenti mislead interpret conclus studi highlight valu integr match casecontrol design regular clr method analysi highdimension transcriptom data propos analyt framework offer improv accuraci robust biolog relev provid practic scalabl approach cancer genom research also support advanc precis medicin translat applic
cancer,"BACKGROUND: While e-health innovations have advanced cancer-care delivery in high-income countries, middle-income countries (MICs) face distinct systemic, infrastructural, and sociocultural challenges in adopting and scaling digital-health interventions. There is a growing imperative to explore how holistic digital platforms can be implemented effectively in oncology within resource-constrained settings. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the barriers and facilitators influencing the scalability and adoption of a comprehensive e-health solution in cancer care, drawing on a realist paradigm to determine what works, for whom, and under which circumstances, in the context of Jordan. METHODS: A qualitative study, underpinned by a realist paradigm, was conducted using in-depth, semi-structured interviews with oncology healthcare professionals from diverse clinical settings in Jordan. Interviews were conducted in Arabic, translated into English, and analyzed using a hybrid inductive-deductive framework approach. The Implementation of Change Model guided interpretation of the findings, enabling the identification of multi-level contextual influences. RESULTS: The analysis yielded a central theme-Facilitators and Barriers to Implementing a Holistic e-health Solution-comprising six deductive subthemes derived from the Implementation of Change Model: (A) Innovation; (B) Patients; (C) Healthcare professionals; (D) Organizational context; (E) Social context; and (F) Economic and political context. Across these subthemes, interpretive codes were classified as barriers or facilitators. Participants emphasized the necessity of assessing e-health readiness prior to implementation, and the importance of integrated, cross-sectoral approaches to support scalable, sustainable solutions. CONCLUSION: This study provides novel, contextually grounded insights into the implementation dynamics of digital transformation in oncology within MICs. It offers actionable guidance for policymakers and system designers aiming to foster sustainable, equitable digital-health ecosystems.",background ehealth innov advanc cancercar deliveri highincom countri middleincom countri mic face distinct system infrastructur sociocultur challeng adopt scale digitalhealth intervent grow imper explor holist digit platform implement effect oncolog within resourceconstrain set object studi aim investig barrier facilit influenc scalabl adopt comprehens ehealth solut cancer care draw realist paradigm determin work circumst context jordan method qualit studi underpin realist paradigm conduct use indepth semistructur interview oncolog healthcar profession divers clinic set jordan interview conduct arab translat english analyz use hybrid inductivededuct framework approach implement chang model guid interpret find enabl identif multilevel contextu influenc result analysi yield central themefacilit barrier implement holist ehealth solutioncompris six deduct subthem deriv implement chang model innov b patient c healthcar profession organiz context e social context f econom polit context across subthem interpret code classifi barrier facilit particip emphas necess assess ehealth readi prior implement import integr crosssector approach support scalabl sustain solut conclus studi provid novel contextu ground insight implement dynam digit transform oncolog within mic offer action guidanc policymak system design aim foster sustain equit digitalhealth ecosystem
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Global cancer is rising, and many survivors struggle to stay active despite clear health benefits. Mobile health tools can help with tracking and guidance, but users' real needs and barriers are unclear. This qualitative metasynthesis summarizes what survivors want, what helps, and what gets in the way. METHODS: We systematically searched CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, CBM, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL from inception to April 2025. Qualitative studies (or qualitative components of mixed-methods studies) exploring survivors' experiences with mHealth-supported PA were eligible. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and appraised methodological quality using the JBI qualitative checklist (2016). Findings were integrated via meta-synthesis, and confidence in synthesized findings was graded with the ConQual approach. Reporting followed ENTREQ. RESULTS: Twelve qualitative studies (n = 243 participants; 8 countries) were included. Fifty findings were aggregated into 11 categories and synthesized into 3 higher-order findings: (1) survivors have multidimensional needs regarding content tailoring, professional input, social features, and usable design; (2) mHealth can strengthen motivation, self-efficacy, and convenience for engaging in PA; and (3) participation is shaped by patient-related, technology-related, and economic factors. CONCLUSION: Addressing survivors' motivations, lived experiences, and practical barriers-through personalization, professional guidance, privacy-preserving social support, and robust technical design-may enhance adoption and sustained use of mHealth for PA in cancer survivorship.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Benefits of ultrasound in breast cancer detection are often limited by the similar appearance of complicated cysts and solid hypoechoic masses with B-mode imaging, which can lead to false positive diagnoses. PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) on short-lag spatial coherence (SLSC) ultrasound images as an objective tool to improve complicated cyst vs solid mass classification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this secondary analysis of a prospective recruitment for the Advanced Ultrasound Signal Processing of Suspicious Breast Images (AUSPICIOUS) observational study (NCT07206888), women scheduled for ultrasound-guided procedures or follow-up of at least 1 breast mass were enrolled from March 2018 to October 2023. Raw ultrasound data were acquired with an Alpinion ECUBE12R research scanner, then post-processed with our custom software. The primary evaluation indicator was gCNR applied to SLSC images with regions of interest determined by 6 radiologists. Outcomes were compared to the same radiologists classifying mass contents as solid, fluid, mixed, or uncertain using B-mode images. The reference standard was determined by aspiration, pathology, or characterization of image features. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and inter-reader agreement (Fleiss' kappa) were assessed. RESULTS: Among 175 cases, 145 breast masses from 115 women (age: 52 +/- 17 years) were analyzed, including 16 complicated cysts and 96 solid masses. The mean AUC for complicated cyst vs solid mass characterization was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94, 0.97) with gCNR applied to SLSC images, relative to a mean lower-bound AUC of 0.67 (range: 0.54-0.76) with readings of B-mode images (P < .05). Inter-reader agreement improved from fair with B-mode (kappa  =  0.40) to moderate with gCNR applied to SLSC images with a 0.76 threshold (kappa  =  0.59, P < .00001). CONCLUSION: Applying an objective gCNR metric to SLSC images improved the differentiation of complicated cysts from solid masses when compared to subjective readings of B-mode images.",background benefit ultrasound breast cancer detect often limit similar appear complic cyst solid hypoecho mass bmode imag lead fals posit diagnos purpos evalu diagnost perform gener contrasttonois ratio gcnr shortlag spatial coher slsc ultrasound imag object tool improv complic cyst vs solid mass classif materi method secondari analysi prospect recruit advanc ultrasound signal process suspici breast imag auspici observ studi nct07206888 women schedul ultrasoundguid procedur followup least 1 breast mass enrol march 2018 octob 2023 raw ultrasound data acquir alpinion ecube12r research scanner postprocess custom softwar primari evalu indic gcnr appli slsc imag region interest determin 6 radiologist outcom compar radiologist classifi mass content solid fluid mix uncertain use bmode imag refer standard determin aspir patholog character imag featur area receiv oper characterist curv auc 95 confid interv ci interread agreement fleiss kappa assess result among 175 case 145 breast mass 115 women age 52 17 year analyz includ 16 complic cyst 96 solid mass mean auc complic cyst vs solid mass character 096 95 ci 094 097 gcnr appli slsc imag rel mean lowerbound auc 067 rang 054076 read bmode imag p 05 interread agreement improv fair bmode kappa 040 moder gcnr appli slsc imag 076 threshold kappa 059 p 00001 conclus appli object gcnr metric slsc imag improv differenti complic cyst solid mass compar subject read bmode imag
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Ischemic stroke has well-established risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. However, strokes can also occur in the context of less common etiologies such as malignancies, particularly as certain malignancies are associated with hypercoagulable states. Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a malignancy that can present with a hypercortisolemic state, which can further exacerbate cancer coagulopathy and the traditional metabolic risk factors of stroke. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old woman presented with expressive aphasia and was found to have multifocal acute infarcts on magnetic resonance imaging. She underwent a thorough cardiac, coagulopathy, and paraneoplastic workup and was found to have a right adrenal mass and was biochemically hypercortisolemic. The patient underwent surgical resection of the adrenal mass and pathology confirmed the diagnosis of ACC. CONCLUSION: The discovery of this rare malignancy underscores the complex interplay between malignancy, hormonal imbalances, hypercoagulability in stroke and the importance of a comprehensive clinical diagnostic evaluation.",introduct ischem stroke wellestablish risk factor hypertens diabet hyperlipidemia atrial fibril howev stroke also occur context less common etiolog malign particularli certain malign associ hypercoagul state adrenocort carcinoma acc malign present hypercortisolem state exacerb cancer coagulopathi tradit metabol risk factor stroke case present 60yearold woman present express aphasia found multifoc acut infarct magnet reson imag underw thorough cardiac coagulopathi paraneoplast workup found right adren mass biochem hypercortisolem patient underw surgic resect adren mass patholog confirm diagnosi acc conclus discoveri rare malign underscor complex interplay malign hormon imbal hypercoagul stroke import comprehens clinic diagnost evalu
cancer,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, growing attention has been paid to the carcinogenicity of endocrine disruptors (EDs). However, their relationship with prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear. This study investigates the association between EDs and PCa to identify key genes that may bridge this relationship. METHODS: The ADME properties and carcinogenicity of the selected endocrine-disrupting chemicals EDs were predicted using the ADMETlab 3.0 and ProTox 3.0 platforms, respectively. Potential target genes related to EDs and PCa were obtained by integrating multiple public databases. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the overlapping genes was constructed and visualized, followed by GO and KEGG enrichment analyses to explore their potential biological mechanisms. From 101 machine learning algorithm combinations, the most relevant key genes for PCa progression were screened. Molecular docking analysis was used to evaluate the binding properties between ED compounds and key targets. Pan-cancer analysis was employed to examine the general role of key genes across multiple cancer types. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) was used to identify natural active products potentially targeting the core genes. Finally, in vitro cell experiments were conducted to validate the effects of EDs on PCa cells and the intervention effects of related natural products. RESULTS: Initially, predictions from the ADMETlab 3.0 and ProTox 3.0 platforms indicated significant in vivo accumulation, endocrine-disrupting effects, and carcinogenicity for the 12 common EDs. Subsequently, the integration of multiple databases identified 233 overlapping targets associated with PCa. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that these targets are primarily involved in regulating cell proliferation, inflammatory responses, and cancer cell metabolism. Among the evaluated machine learning algorithms, the CoxBoost + SuperPC hybrid model demonstrated superior predictive performance and robustness. Subsequent analysis pinpointed three key regulatory genes: CD38, MMP11, and PLK1. Molecular docking simulations confirmed potential interactions between EDs compounds and the core target, PLK1. Furthermore, five natural active products were identified as potential agents to mitigate the adverse effects induced by EDs exposure. Finally, in vitro cell experiments demonstrated that Benzo[a]pyrene promotes PLK1 expression and PCa progression, whereas Cryptotanshinone effectively counteracts these effects. CONCLUSION: This multidisciplinary study unveils PLK1 as a pivotal molecular target through which EDs drive PCa progression. Furthermore, we identify five natural compounds, notably Cryptotanshinone, that counteract the carcinogenic effects of EDs by targeting PLK1.

cancer,"R-loops consist of double-stranded DNA-RNA hybrids and a complementary DNA strand that is displaced from the duplex. R-loops play important role in numerous normal physiological processes, including DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, RNA editing, replication, DNA repair, immunoglobulin class switching, and chromosome segregation during cell division. However, excessive or untimely formation of R-loops can lead to replicative collapse and subsequent DNA damage, resulting in genomic instability. One type of genomic rearrangements that is strongly associated with cancer malignancy is the extrachromosomal amplification of genes on circular DNA molecules (ecDNA). These molecules are relieved of hereditary constraints and conventional segregation laws and can endow cancer cells with the ability to rapidly change their genome, thereby accelerating tumor evolution and the development of therapy resistance. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that upregulated transcription of a gene can increase its susceptibility to amplification. Although the mechanisms underlying these processes are not yet fully understood, R-loops may play an important role in initiating gene amplification. In this review, we highlight the role of R-loops in replicative collapse, double-strand breaks, and DNA damage repair. We also provide examples of gene amplifications that is known to be induced by R-loops. Finally, we discuss amplification mechanisms in which involvement of R-loops has not yet been demonstrated, but appears highly likely.",rloop consist doublestrand dnarna hybrid complementari dna strand displac duplex rloop play import role numer normal physiolog process includ dna methyl chromatin remodel rna edit replic dna repair immunoglobulin class switch chromosom segreg cell divis howev excess untim format rloop lead replic collaps subsequ dna damag result genom instabl one type genom rearrang strongli associ cancer malign extrachromosom amplif gene circular dna molecul ecdna molecul reliev hereditari constraint convent segreg law endow cancer cell abil rapidli chang genom therebi acceler tumor evolut develop therapi resist multipl line evid indic upregul transcript gene increas suscept amplif although mechan underli process yet fulli understood rloop may play import role initi gene amplif review highlight role rloop replic collaps doublestrand break dna damag repair also provid exampl gene amplif known induc rloop final discuss amplif mechan involv rloop yet demonstr appear highli like
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is considered a potential therapeutic strategy for cancers, as it exacerbates calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), thereby inducing apoptosis. However, the mechanisms underlying TNF-alpha's effects at the single-molecule level remain unclear. METHODS: This study employed multiple modes of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to investigate the impact of TNF-alpha on breast cancer cells. The measurements were performed with nanometer spatial resolution, picoNewton force sensitivity, picoAmpere current precision, and 0.1 mV surface potential accuracy. RESULTS: The results revealed that TNF-alpha treatment significantly increased the density and aggregation of VGCCs on the cell membrane while enhancing their channel activity. Concurrently, the electrical conductivity and surface potential of the membrane were elevated, collectively promoting exacerbated calcium influx. DISCUSSION: These findings elucidate the mechanisms by which TNF-alpha modulates VGCC distribution and electrophysiological properties to amplify calcium signaling, ultimately triggering apoptosis. This study provides unprecedented insights into TNF-alpha-induced calcium dysregulation in cancer cells at the single-molecule level, offering a novel approach for investigating apoptosis and advancing targeted therapies for breast cancer and other malignancies.",introduct tumor necrosi factoralpha tnfalpha consid potenti therapeut strategi cancer exacerb calcium influx voltageg calcium channel vgcc therebi induc apoptosi howev mechan underli tnfalpha effect singlemolecul level remain unclear method studi employ multipl mode atom forc microscopi afm investig impact tnfalpha breast cancer cell measur perform nanomet spatial resolut piconewton forc sensit picoamper current precis 01 mv surfac potenti accuraci result result reveal tnfalpha treatment significantli increas densiti aggreg vgcc cell membran enhanc channel activ concurr electr conduct surfac potenti membran elev collect promot exacerb calcium influx discuss find elucid mechan tnfalpha modul vgcc distribut electrophysiolog properti amplifi calcium signal ultim trigger apoptosi studi provid unpreced insight tnfalphainduc calcium dysregul cancer cell singlemolecul level offer novel approach investig apoptosi advanc target therapi breast cancer malign

This study presents the design, synthesis, and evaluation of new quinoline- and coumarin-derived isoxazole analogs (7a-e, 8a-f, 9a-e) and their Re(i) and Ru(ii) complexes (7b(Re), 9b(Re), 7b(Ru), 9b(Ru)). Antiproliferative assays against eight human cancer cell lines and noncancerous PBMCs identified quinoline amidoxime 8f as particularly potent, with IC(50) values of 2.1-4.7 microM against hematologic cancers (DND-41, HL-60, Z-138) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Capan-1), with selectivity indices of up to 48. Permeability and metabolic stability studies showed high membrane permeability and moderate clearance for 8f. Molecular docking, validated by redocking of J1Q (PDB ID: 6QGK), confirmed that 8f forms stable, energetically favorable complexes with Bcl-2 (DeltaG_bind = -84.98 kcal mol(-1)).

cancer,"Cervical cancer has been acknowledged as one of the major global public health problems, especially in developing nations where access to screening and treatment modalities, is limited. The objectives of the current article are to identify the potential barriers that can limit cervical cancer screening in rural areas and propose targeted interventions to overcome them to improve the overall uptake of these screening services. In rural settings, with limited number of healthcare establishments, it becomes difficult for women to access screening services, and the limited number of specialists and trained healthcare personnel further augments the concern. Acknowledging the magnitude of the problem and the preventable nature of the disease, it is the need of the hour to strengthen cervical cancer screening programs and integrate these activities into rural healthcare delivery systems. In conclusion, the implementation of screening for cervical cancer in rural settings can play a huge role in the early detection and improvement of the overall prognosis. This calls for the need to identify potential barriers and implement specific interventions to improve early detection of cervical cancer and reduce disparities in access to screening in rural settings.",cervic cancer acknowledg one major global public health problem especi develop nation access screen treatment modal limit object current articl identifi potenti barrier limit cervic cancer screen rural area propos target intervent overcom improv overal uptak screen servic rural set limit number healthcar establish becom difficult women access screen servic limit number specialist train healthcar personnel augment concern acknowledg magnitud problem prevent natur diseas need hour strengthen cervic cancer screen program integr activ rural healthcar deliveri system conclus implement screen cervic cancer rural set play huge role earli detect improv overal prognosi call need identifi potenti barrier implement specif intervent improv earli detect cervic cancer reduc dispar access screen rural set

We present the case of a 66-year-old multiparous postmenopausal woman with a previous history of invasive breast carcinoma, managed with mastectomy, chemotherapy, and hormone treatment. The patient presented with vaginal bleeding and leukorrhea. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed endometrial thickening with myometrial and parametrial invasion, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed no evidence of nodal or distant metastases. The pipelle biopsy revealed poorly differentiated cancer. She underwent a robotic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, omental biopsy, and peritoneal cytology procedures. The histopathological analysis verified a pure LCNEC and was staged as pT2N0M0. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for synaptophysin, CD56, chromogranin, and p53 (mutant), weak positivity for EMA, and a Ki-67 index of 80%. The tumor exhibited microsatellite stability, and next-generation sequencing revealed no relevant mutations. She received adjuvant therapy with pelvic radiation with concurrent cisplatin, followed by vaginal brachytherapy, and four cycles of chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide.

cancer,"Physical activity (PA) is vital for managing menopausal symptoms and reducing noncommunicable diseases in middle-aged women. Despite the known benefits, many women do not meet the recommended activity levels and view household tasks as sufficient owing to factors such as time constraints, lack of motivation, or physical limitations. This article explores the significance, forms, and health impacts of PA in menopausal women. Regular PA, including aerobic exercise, resistance training, and yoga, offers several health benefits. Exercise enhances adult neurogenesis, brain structure, learning, memory, and cognitive abilities, potentially preventing age-related declines. PA during mid-life, defined as regular engagement in exercise such as walking, cycling, or resistance training, is linked to successful aging. Successful aging refers to the absence of chronic illnesses, disabilities, or mental health issues. Exercise improves sleep quality and reduces stress through endorphin production. Regular PA reduces the risk of chronic diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Recommendations include cardiorespiratory activities, strength training, and balance exercises. Understanding these benefits can promote better health outcomes in this critical life stage.",physic activ pa vital manag menopaus symptom reduc noncommunic diseas middleag women despit known benefit mani women meet recommend activ level view household task suffici owe factor time constraint lack motiv physic limit articl explor signific form health impact pa menopaus women regular pa includ aerob exercis resist train yoga offer sever health benefit exercis enhanc adult neurogenesi brain structur learn memori cognit abil potenti prevent agerel declin pa midlif defin regular engag exercis walk cycl resist train link success age success age refer absenc chronic ill disabl mental health issu exercis improv sleep qualiti reduc stress endorphin product regular pa reduc risk chronic diseas includ cancer cardiovascular diseas diabet recommend includ cardiorespiratori activ strength train balanc exercis understand benefit promot better health outcom critic life stage
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: HPV infection is causative agent for cervical cancer, majority of HPV infections are low-grade, self-limited, and revert spontaneously in some HPV infection fails to clear this hints towards presence of certain genetic factors which predispose them to increase risk of pre-cancer and cancer. We aimed to investigate the factors which have bearing on rising cancer cases in India and to elucidate the genetic susceptibility distribution of NAD (P) H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 C609T gene polymorphism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study recruited 142 women with biopsy-proven cervical cancer (the case group) and 142 women with normal cytology (the control group). DNA extracted from blood via QIAamp DNA mini kit. The DNA of each participant was amplified and the genotype and allelic frequency were compared. RESULTS: In our study, maximum women in the case group had stage II (69.7%) squamous cell carcinoma (97.2%). 75.4% of the cases had moderately differentiated carcinoma and had no treatment before (43.7%). Among cases, the prevalence of genotype CC, CT and TT was 42.3%, 19.7% and 38.0%, respectively compared to 54.9%, 13.4% and 31.7%, in controls. The odds of having CC (odds ratio [OR] =0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] =0.38-1.08), CC or CT in contrast to TT (OR = 0.756; 95% CI = 0.46-1.23), CC in contrast to TT/CT (OR = 0.694; 95% CI = 0.44-1.10) was lesser in cases compared to the controls, while Odds of allele T as compared to C were significantly elevated in cases as compared to that in the controls (OR = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.06-2.06). The proportion of TT genotype was elevated in advanced stages as compared to early stages.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is a prevalent gynecological complaint with diverse underlying etiologies, ranging from benign endometrial changes to malignancy. Early identification of malignant pathology is critical for effective management. This study aims to evaluate the histopathological spectrum of endometrial abnormalities in women with AUB and assess the diagnostic utility of endometrial thickness (ET) and endometrial volume (EV) in predicting endometrial carcinoma. METHODS: This retrospective study included women presenting with AUB who underwent transvaginal ultrasound and endometrial sampling. Histopathological findings were categorized into benign, polypoidal, hyperplastic, and malignant groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine optimal ET and EV cutoff values for predicting endometrial malignancy. RESULTS: Disordered proliferative endometrium was the most common histological finding (38.0%), followed by endometrial hyperplasia (14.0%) and endometrial carcinoma (8.7%). Malignancy was significantly associated with age >50 years (46.2%, P = 0.002), higher body mass index (mean 35.6, P = 0.024), and hypertension (HTN) (84.6%, P < 0.001). ROC analysis showed that an EV cutoff of 15 ml had superior diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] =0.96, sensitivity = 90.2%, specificity = 95.4%) compared to an ET cutoff of 12 mm (AUC = 0.90, sensitivity = 78.0%, specificity = 96.3%). CONCLUSION: Age, obesity, and HTN are significant risk factors for endometrial carcinoma in patients with AUB. EV demonstrates superior diagnostic performance compared to ET and holds promise as a valuable, noninvasive marker in the evaluation of endometrial malignancy. Incorporating EV into routine diagnostic algorithms improves early cancer detection and reduces the need for invasive procedures.",background abnorm uterin bleed aub preval gynecolog complaint divers underli etiolog rang benign endometri chang malign earli identif malign patholog critic effect manag studi aim evalu histopatholog spectrum endometri abnorm women aub assess diagnost util endometri thick et endometri volum ev predict endometri carcinoma method retrospect studi includ women present aub underw transvagin ultrasound endometri sampl histopatholog find categor benign polypoid hyperplast malign group receiv oper characterist roc curv analysi use determin optim et ev cutoff valu predict endometri malign result disord prolif endometrium common histolog find 380 follow endometri hyperplasia 140 endometri carcinoma 87 malign significantli associ age 50 year 462 p 0002 higher bodi mass index mean 356 p 0024 hypertens htn 846 p 0001 roc analysi show ev cutoff 15 ml superior diagnost accuraci area curv auc 096 sensit 902 specif 954 compar et cutoff 12 mm auc 090 sensit 780 specif 963 conclus age obes htn signific risk factor endometri carcinoma patient aub ev demonstr superior diagnost perform compar et hold promis valuabl noninvas marker evalu endometri malign incorpor ev routin diagnost algorithm improv earli cancer detect reduc need invas procedur
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between thyroid hormone levels and pathological characteristics in patients with breast cancer. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 120 breast cancer patients who received treatment at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University between January 2020 and December 2023. A total of 100 healthy individuals undergoing routine physical examinations were enrolled as the control group. Serum levels of free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroglobulin antibody (TG-Ab), and Thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) were measured and compared between the two groups. The diagnostic performance of thyroid hormones for breast cancer was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and correlations between thyroid hormone levels and pathological features of breast cancer were further analyzed. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in serum FT3, TSH, T3, or T4 levels between the two groups (P = 0.446, 0.594, 0.405 and 0.781, respectively). Compared with healthy controls, patients with breast cancer were observed to have significantly higher FT4 levels and substantially higher TPO-Ab levels, despite both parameters remaining within their normal reference ranges (all P < 0.001). ROC analysis demonstrated that the areas under the curve (AUCs) of FT4 and TPO-Ab for predicting breast cancer were 0.701 and 0.805, respectively. Furthermore, FT4 levels were significantly associated with tumor size, clinical stage, and lymph node metastasis (all P < 0.001). TPO-Ab levels were significantly correlated with tumor size, clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) (P = 0.006, 0.015, 0.046, 0.048 and 0.017, respectively). Follow-up analysis further revealed that clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy, ER and PR expression, as well as FT4 and TPO-Ab levels, were independent factors influencing breast cancer recurrence. CONCLUSION: Serum FT4 and TPO-Ab levels are closely associated with the occurrence, progression, and specific pathological features of breast cancer, demonstrating favorable diagnostic and predictive value. Moreover, they may serve as important potential biomarkers for evaluating the risk of recurrence in patients with breast cancer.",object investig associ thyroid hormon level patholog characterist patient breast cancer method retrospect analysi conduct 120 breast cancer patient receiv treatment first affili hospit xian jiaotong univers januari 2020 decemb 2023 total 100 healthi individu undergo routin physic examin enrol control group serum level free triiodothyronin ft3 free thyroxin ft4 thyroidstimul hormon tsh thyroglobulin antibodi tgab thyroid peroxidas antibodi tpoab measur compar two group diagnost perform thyroid hormon breast cancer evalu use receiv oper characterist roc curv analysi correl thyroid hormon level patholog featur breast cancer analyz result signific differ observ serum ft3 tsh t3 t4 level two group p 0446 0594 0405 0781 respect compar healthi control patient breast cancer observ significantli higher ft4 level substanti higher tpoab level despit paramet remain within normal refer rang p 0001 roc analysi demonstr area curv auc ft4 tpoab predict breast cancer 0701 0805 respect furthermor ft4 level significantli associ tumor size clinic stage lymph node metastasi p 0001 tpoab level significantli correl tumor size clinic stage lymph node metastasi express estrogen receptor er progesteron receptor pr p 0006 0015 0046 0048 0017 respect followup analysi reveal clinic stage lymph node metastasi postop radiotherapi chemotherapi er pr express well ft4 tpoab level independ factor influenc breast cancer recurr conclus serum ft4 tpoab level close associ occurr progress specif patholog featur breast cancer demonstr favor diagnost predict valu moreov may serv import potenti biomark evalu risk recurr patient breast cancer
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) methylation for early detection and prognostic monitoring of lung cancer. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the DNA methylation test results of 150 lung cancer patients and 100 patients with benign lung lesions enrolled from January 2021 to December 2023. Quantitative methylation fluorescence analysis and bisulfite sequencing were used to measure ctDNA gene methylation, with ROC curves assessing early-stage diagnostic value. Lung cancer patients were followed for 1 year, then grouped by survival status. Cox regression identified poor prognosis factors, and ROC curves evaluated ctDNA methylation's prognostic value. An external cohort of 80 lung cancer patients from May 2022 to December 2023 validated the model using ROC and calibration curves. RESULTS: The positivity rates of SHOX2, CDO1, and SOX17 were significantly higher in lung cancer patients than those in controls (all P<0.05). The combined diagnostic model of these genes had a higher AUC than single-marker tests (Z = 2.363, 2.157, 2.061, all P<0.05). Compared with the favorable prognosis group, the unfavorable prognosis group had a higher proportion of stage III-IV tumors and higher positivity rates of SHOX2, CDO1, SOX17, and HOXA7 (all P<0.05). SHOX2, CDO1 and SOX17 were identified as independent poor-prognosis risk factors (all P<0.05), and their combined prognostic assessment outperformed single-marker tests (Z = 3.316, 2.394, 2.696, all P<0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with negative methylation of SHOX2, CDO1, and SOX17 had longer survival (Log-rank chi (2) = 6.273, 4.524, 4.364, P<0.001). The model showed good predictive performance (AUC = 0.773), and external validation confirmed its accuracy (AUC = 0.682). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal methylation of SHOX2, CDO1, and SOX17 is prevalent in lung cancer, potentially serving as biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognostic monitoring.",object investig valu circul tumor dna ctdna methyl earli detect prognost monitor lung cancer method retrospect analysi conduct dna methyl test result 150 lung cancer patient 100 patient benign lung lesion enrol januari 2021 decemb 2023 quantit methyl fluoresc analysi bisulfit sequenc use measur ctdna gene methyl roc curv assess earlystag diagnost valu lung cancer patient follow 1 year group surviv statu cox regress identifi poor prognosi factor roc curv evalu ctdna methyl prognost valu extern cohort 80 lung cancer patient may 2022 decemb 2023 valid model use roc calibr curv result posit rate shox2 cdo1 sox17 significantli higher lung cancer patient control p005 combin diagnost model gene higher auc singlemark test z 2363 2157 2061 p005 compar favor prognosi group unfavor prognosi group higher proport stage iiiiv tumor higher posit rate shox2 cdo1 sox17 hoxa7 p005 shox2 cdo1 sox17 identifi independ poorprognosi risk factor p005 combin prognost assess outperform singlemark test z 3316 2394 2696 p005 kaplanmei analysi show patient neg methyl shox2 cdo1 sox17 longer surviv logrank chi 2 6273 4524 4364 p0001 model show good predict perform auc 0773 extern valid confirm accuraci auc 0682 conclus abnorm methyl shox2 cdo1 sox17 preval lung cancer potenti serv biomark earli diagnosi prognost monitor

cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Endometriosis increases ovarian cancer (OC) risk through genetic mutations, chronic inflammation, and hormonal dysregulation, yet the underlying molecular pathways remain underexplored. This study aims to identify endometriosis-associated prognostic biomarkers in OC. METHODS: Transcriptomic and clinical data from TCGA-OC and GSE53963 were integrated for comprehensive analysis. Prognostic models were constructed using LASSO and Cox regression. Tumor microenvironment (TME) characteristics, immune checkpoints, and drug sensitivity were evaluated with ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT, TIDE, and drug sensitivity profiling. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq, GSE184880) was employed to explore immune and gene expression patterns. MEGF8 function was validated through in vitro assays. RESULTS: Consensus clustering identified three OC molecular subtypes (A, B, and C), with subtype B showing significantly better overall survival (P = 0.001). Subtype A exhibited a ""dual malignant phenotype"", characterized by enhanced cell adhesion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), TGF-beta activation, and an immunosuppressive TME. An 8-gene prognostic model, including MEGF8, effectively stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups, with high-risk patients showing poorer survival, immune evasion, and elevated stromal scores. Drug sensitivity analysis indicated that the low-risk group was more responsive to PI3K/AKT/mTOR and VEGFR inhibitors. MEGF8 was identified as a key regulator in cancer stem cells, promoting tumor progression through metabolic reprogramming and extracellular matrix remodeling. Functionally, MEGF8 knockdown suppressed OC cell proliferation and migration. CONCLUSION: This study delineated the molecular-immune landscape of OC, established an 8-gene prognostic model, and identified MEGF8 as a potential therapeutic target. The model predicts responses to immunotherapy and targeted therapies, supporting personalized OC management.",object endometriosi increas ovarian cancer oc risk genet mutat chronic inflamm hormon dysregul yet underli molecular pathway remain underexplor studi aim identifi endometriosisassoci prognost biomark oc method transcriptom clinic data tcgaoc gse53963 integr comprehens analysi prognost model construct use lasso cox regress tumor microenviron tme characterist immun checkpoint drug sensit evalu estim cibersort tide drug sensit profil singlecel rna sequenc scrnaseq gse184880 employ explor immun gene express pattern megf8 function valid vitro assay result consensu cluster identifi three oc molecular subtyp b c subtyp b show significantli better overal surviv p 0001 subtyp exhibit dual malign phenotyp character enhanc cell adhes epithelialmesenchym transit emt tgfbeta activ immunosuppress tme 8gene prognost model includ megf8 effect stratifi patient high lowrisk group highrisk patient show poorer surviv immun evas elev stromal score drug sensit analysi indic lowrisk group respons pi3kaktmtor vegfr inhibitor megf8 identifi key regul cancer stem cell promot tumor progress metabol reprogram extracellular matrix remodel function megf8 knockdown suppress oc cell prolifer migrat conclus studi delin molecularimmun landscap oc establish 8gene prognost model identifi megf8 potenti therapeut target model predict respons immunotherapi target therapi support person oc manag
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the factors influencing low intake dehydration in patients with malignant tumors and to construct a nomogram model for predicting its risk. METHODS: A total of 383 patients with malignant tumors were enrolled in this study. Based on the presence of low intake dehydration at admission, patients were classified into a dehydration group (119 patients) and a non-dehydration group (264 patients). Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with low intake dehydration. A nomogram model was subsequently constructed, and its predictive performance was validated. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between the dehydration and non-dehydration groups in age (chi(2) = 6.988, P = 0.008), serum albumin (t = 3.158, P = 0.002), tumor duration (t = 4.257, P < 0.001), swallowing disorders (chi(2) = 8.753, P = 0.003), Cancer Patient Appetite Questionnaire (CASQ) score (t = 3.373, P = 0.001), and Barthel Index (BI) score (t = 2.768, P = 0.006). Logistic regression analysis revealed that age >/= 60 years, serum albumin level, tumor duration, dysphagia, CASQ score, and BI score were significant factors associated with low intake dehydration in cancer patients. The constructed nomogram model showed no overfitting (P > 0.05 in the goodness-of-fit test), with an area under the ROC curve of 0.861. Decision curve analysis confirmed the model's practical value. Ten-fold cross-validation demonstrated the robustness of the model.

cancer,"OBJECTIVES: Colorectal cancer (CRC) has one of the highest incidence and mortality rates among cancers, particularly concerning the rates of diagnosis. Serum exosomes (Exos) are crucial mediators for the intercellular transmission of genetic information. These vesicles contain various tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) that play a role in the noncoding regulation of tumor genes. Consequently, they are anticipated to become valuable non-invasive diagnostic and predictive biomarkers for CRC. METHODS: At the Affiliated Taian City Central Hospital of Qingdao University, we isolated and extracted serum Exos from 201 healthy donors and 205 patients with CRC. To measure Exo physical morphology, we utilized qNano, transmission electron microscopy, and a particle size analyzer. Western blotting was conducted to confirm the expression of surface and nuclear proteins in the Exos. Gene chips were employed to screen for differentially expressed tRF RNAs. The quantitative PCR technology was deployed to ascertain 5'Leader-ArgTCG and 3'tRF-SerGCT differential expression. CRC diagnostic efficiency was assessed utilizing the area under the curve. RESULTS: We compared 5'Leader-ArgTCG and 3'tRF-SerGCT expression in 205 patients with CRC and 201 healthy donors. Among them, 5'Leader-ArgTCG was significantly downregulated, while 3'tRF-SerGCT was significantly upregulated. The diagnostic efficiency of predicting 5'Leader-ArgTCG and 3'tRF-SerGCT in serum Exos using survival curves was 0.659 and 0.659, respectively. Meanwhile, the diagnostic efficiency of combining the two tumor markers was 0.954. CONCLUSION: Serum Exos 5'Leader-ArgTCG and 3'tRF-SerGCT were differentially expressed in patients with CRC. Combining these two tumor markers may serve as a predictive indicator for the non-invasive diagnosis of CRC, demonstrating notable statistical significance.",object colorect cancer crc one highest incid mortal rate among cancer particularli concern rate diagnosi serum exosom exo crucial mediat intercellular transmiss genet inform vesicl contain variou trnaderiv fragment trf play role noncod regul tumor gene consequ anticip becom valuabl noninvas diagnost predict biomark crc method affili taian citi central hospit qingdao univers isol extract serum exo 201 healthi donor 205 patient crc measur exo physic morpholog util qnano transmiss electron microscopi particl size analyz western blot conduct confirm express surfac nuclear protein exo gene chip employ screen differenti express trf rna quantit pcr technolog deploy ascertain 5leaderargtcg 3trfsergct differenti express crc diagnost effici assess util area curv result compar 5leaderargtcg 3trfsergct express 205 patient crc 201 healthi donor among 5leaderargtcg significantli downregul 3trfsergct significantli upregul diagnost effici predict 5leaderargtcg 3trfsergct serum exo use surviv curv 0659 0659 respect meanwhil diagnost effici combin two tumor marker 0954 conclus serum exo 5leaderargtcg 3trfsergct differenti express patient crc combin two tumor marker may serv predict indic noninvas diagnosi crc demonstr notabl statist signific
cancer,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of ciprofol or propofol anesthesia on cognitive function in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer. METHODS: Data of 100 elderly patients were retrospectively collected and cases were assigned to the observation group (ciprofol, n=50) and the control group (propofol, n=50) according to the anesthesia method. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and bispectral index (BIS) were recorded at anesthesia induction and intraoperative time points. Post-anesthesia recovery findings, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, incidence of agitation, and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) were compared. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively. Serum levels of aldosterone (ALD), cortisol (COR), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), S100beta protein, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and oxidative stress markers [reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD)] were measured before and after surgery. RESULTS: HR, MAP, and BIS values were significantly lower in the observation group than in the control group at corresponding time points. The observation group also had better recovery profiles, lower VAS scores, and reduced incidence of POCD and adverse reactions (P < 0.05). Postoperative MMSE scores were significantly higher in the observation group (P < 0.05). Although postoperative serum ALD, COR, ACTH, ROS, MDA, SOD, S100beta, and NSE levels increased in both groups, the elevation was less pronounced in the observation group (P < 0.05).

cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic use of erianin, a bioactive compound derived from traditional Chinese medicine, in the treatment of EC and its regulatory effects on glutamine metabolism. METHODS: Human Endometrial cancer (EC) cell lines, HEC-1A and Ishikawa, were exposed to erianin, and cellular proliferation and migratory capacity were assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and the Transwell migration assay, respectively. Glutamine metabolism was evaluated by quantifying intracellular glutamine, alpha-ketoglutaric acid (alpha-KG), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). A xenograft tumor model was used to validate the antitumor efficacy of erianin in vivo. The changes in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling were analyzed by western blotting. RESULTS: Erianin treatment significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of EC cells in vitro and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Additionally, erianin downregulated glutamine metabolism, as evidenced by reduced levels of glutamic acid, alpha-KG, and ATP. Interestingly, activation of the ERK signaling pathway mitigated the antitumor and metabolic inhibitory effects of erianin on EC cells. CONCLUSION: Erianin inhibits glutamine metabolism and suppresses the growth of EC through the ERK signaling pathway.",object investig therapeut use erianin bioactiv compound deriv tradit chines medicin treatment ec regulatori effect glutamin metabol method human endometri cancer ec cell line hec1a ishikawa expos erianin cellular prolifer migratori capac assess use cell count kit8 cck8 assay transwel migrat assay respect glutamin metabol evalu quantifi intracellular glutamin alphaketoglutar acid alphakg adenosin triphosph atp xenograft tumor model use valid antitumor efficaci erianin vivo chang extracellular signalregul kinas erk signal analyz western blot result erianin treatment significantli inhibit prolifer migrat ec cell vitro suppress tumor growth vivo addit erianin downregul glutamin metabol evidenc reduc level glutam acid alphakg atp interestingli activ erk signal pathway mitig antitumor metabol inhibitori effect erianin ec cell conclus erianin inhibit glutamin metabol suppress growth ec erk signal pathway
cancer,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies, with surgery being one of its primary treatment modalities. The common sites of distant metastasis primarily include the lungs and bones. A 69-year-old male patient reported bowel movement onset accompanied by dizziness and occasional chest tightness two months prior to consultation. Upon completion of the Computed Tomography (CT) examination, the patient's scan revealed a heterogeneous mass shadow in the descending segment of the duodenum, measuring approximately 9.3 * 7.8 * 9.0 cm in size. Enhanced scanning demonstrated uneven enhancement, leading to the consideration of a malignant neoplastic lesion. The surrounding fatty spaces were indistinct, with multiple enlarged lymph nodes visible, suggestive of perineural lymph node metastasis. Due to the massive size of the tumor, its nature could not be definitively ascertained preoperatively, prompting the patient to undergo surgical resection. Postoperative pathological analysis indicated duodenal metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma. The metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma to the duodenum is exceedingly rare, especially in a patient seven years post-surgery from liver cancer. The treatment of duodenal metastasis from hepatic carcinoma is complex and necessitates individualized management strategies tailored to diverse clinical scenarios.",hepatocellular carcinoma hcc one preval malign surgeri one primari treatment modal common site distant metastasi primarili includ lung bone 69yearold male patient report bowel movement onset accompani dizzi occasion chest tight two month prior consult upon complet comput tomographi ct examin patient scan reveal heterogen mass shadow descend segment duodenum measur approxim 93 78 90 cm size enhanc scan demonstr uneven enhanc lead consider malign neoplast lesion surround fatti space indistinct multipl enlarg lymph node visibl suggest perineur lymph node metastasi due massiv size tumor natur could definit ascertain preoper prompt patient undergo surgic resect postop patholog analysi indic duoden metastasi hepatocellular carcinoma metastasi hepatocellular carcinoma duodenum exceedingli rare especi patient seven year postsurgeri liver cancer treatment duoden metastasi hepat carcinoma complex necessit individu manag strategi tailor divers clinic scenario
cancer,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of molecular classification-based postoperative adjuvant therapy on survival outcomes and treatment safety in patients with endometrial cancer. METHODS: This retrospective study included 208 endometrial cancer patients treated between January 2022 and January 2025. Patients were divided into a control group (n = 102), receiving conventional adjuvant therapy, and an observation group (n = 106), receiving molecular classification-based personalized regimens. The primary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary measures included objective response, treatment-related toxicity, treatment delivery factors, patient-reported outcomes, and next-generation sequencing of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Multivariate Cox regression was used to explore molecular subtypes and clinicopathologic predictors of 5-year DFS. RESULTS: In the observation group, immune therapy was exclusively administered, and treatment regimens significantly differed from the control group, which received chemoradiotherapy. The observation group showed significantly better DFS (HR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.30-0.89, P = 0.01) and OS (HR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.21-0.95, P = 0.03). Molecular subtype analysis indicated better prognosis for POLE-ultramutated tumors and poorer prognosis for p53-abnormal tumors. The observation group had fewer adverse events (grade >/= 2: 38.7% vs. 63.7%, P = 0.001) and higher objective response rates (65.1% vs. 43.1%, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Molecular classification-based adjuvant therapy improved survival, response rates, and ctDNA clearance with fewer toxicities. These findings support incorporating molecular classification into postoperative treatment to enhance outcomes in endometrial cancer.",object evalu effect molecular classificationbas postop adjuv therapi surviv outcom treatment safeti patient endometri cancer method retrospect studi includ 208 endometri cancer patient treat januari 2022 januari 2025 patient divid control group n 102 receiv convent adjuv therapi observ group n 106 receiv molecular classificationbas person regimen primari endpoint diseasefre surviv df overal surviv os secondari measur includ object respons treatmentrel toxic treatment deliveri factor patientreport outcom nextgener sequenc circul tumor dna ctdna multivari cox regress use explor molecular subtyp clinicopatholog predictor 5year df result observ group immun therapi exclus administ treatment regimen significantli differ control group receiv chemoradiotherapi observ group show significantli better df hr 052 95 ci 030089 p 001 os hr 045 95 ci 021095 p 003 molecular subtyp analysi indic better prognosi poleultramut tumor poorer prognosi p53abnorm tumor observ group fewer advers event grade 2 387 vs 637 p 0001 higher object respons rate 651 vs 431 p 0001 conclus molecular classificationbas adjuv therapi improv surviv respons rate ctdna clearanc fewer toxic find support incorpor molecular classif postop treatment enhanc outcom endometri cancer
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Esophageal carcinoma (ESCA) is a common malignancy, and modulating radiosensitivity is crucial for individualized treatment. Tenascin XB (TNXB) overexpression in tumors is speculated to influence radiosensitivity. This study aims to investigate whether TNXB overexpression prior to irradiation sensitizes human ESCA cells in vitro. METHODS: The expression of TNXB in tumor specimens was examined using Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry. The relationships between TNXB expression and clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed. Two human ESCA cell lines (TE-1 and OE33) were subjected to explore the effect of TNXB expression on radiosensitivity. DNA damage, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and protein expression were assessed by colony formation assay, western blotting and flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: TNXB displayed a low expression in tumor tissues. Reduced TNXB expression was significantly correlated with larger tumor size and higher TNM stage. TNXB overexpression coupled with X-ray irradiation markedly suppressed colony formation in TE-1 and OE33 cells, and increased gammaH2AX expression, apoptosis rate, and promoted cell cycle arrest. Additionally, the combined treatment of TNXB overexpression and X-ray irradiation resulted in upregulation and phosphorylation of Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) and P53, leading to elevated cleaved-caspase3 and decreased pro-caspase3 levels. si-ATM treatment reversed these effects. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that TNXB enhances radiosensitivity in TE-1 and TE-10 cells by the ATM/P53 pathway.",object esophag carcinoma esca common malign modul radiosensit crucial individu treatment tenascin xb tnxb overexpress tumor specul influenc radiosensit studi aim investig whether tnxb overexpress prior irradi sensit human esca cell vitro method express tnxb tumor specimen examin use realtim quantit polymeras chain reaction rtqpcr immunohistochemistri relationship tnxb express clinicopatholog characterist analyz two human esca cell line te1 oe33 subject explor effect tnxb express radiosensit dna damag apoptosi cell cycl arrest protein express assess coloni format assay western blot flow cytometri respect result tnxb display low express tumor tissu reduc tnxb express significantli correl larger tumor size higher tnm stage tnxb overexpress coupl xray irradi markedli suppress coloni format te1 oe33 cell increas gammah2ax express apoptosi rate promot cell cycl arrest addit combin treatment tnxb overexpress xray irradi result upregul phosphoryl ataxia telangiectasia mutat atm p53 lead elev cleavedcaspase3 decreas procaspase3 level siatm treatment revers effect conclus find demonstr tnxb enhanc radiosensit te1 te10 cell atmp53 pathway

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Despite the alternatives available in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), evaluating new therapies continues to be a challenge for clinicians and decision-makers. We aimed to generate a conceptual framework and establish the value criteria for evaluating treatments in mCRC and to apply this framework to assess the value of trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI) + bevacizumab (BEVA) in advanced lines of therapy for mCRC versus alternatives. METHODS: A multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) was conducted according to the modified EVIDEM assessment framework and the following process: defining the decision problem, selecting and structuring the related criteria identified in a literature review, weighting criteria, measurement of performance, and scoring alternatives, to evaluate of mCRC therapies in Catalonia (Spain). An expert panel of five members with experience in cancer treatment in Catalonia was involved. A hierarchical and non-hierarchical weighting of the criteria and sub-criteria was performed. An evidence matrix of available treatments was developed, and experts assigned scores comparing FTD/TPI + BEVA versus alternatives. RESULTS: Five value criteria and 18 sub-criteria were selected to evaluate mCRC therapies. According to hierarchical method, efficacy had the highest weight, followed by safety, and lower weights for the rest: cost, guidelines/expert consensus, and epidemiology. In the efficacy dimension, overall survival (OS) had the highest weight, while severe adverse events received the highest score in terms of safety. Non-hierarchical weighting corroborated these results. Treatment with FTD/TPI + BEVA obtained a positive overall value contribution of 0.91, 0.43 points considering only comparative criteria. Comparative criteria were highly important, obtaining values contribution for efficacy, safety and cost of 0.19, 0.15 and 0.12 points, respectively. OS (0.20), progression-free survival (0.19), disease control rate (0.16) and health-related quality of life (0.16) were the most relevant sub-criteria. CONCLUSION: Based on this MCDA, the high value contribution of FTD/TPI + BEVA suggests its substantial benefits over the most used alternatives.",background despit altern avail metastat colorect cancer mcrc evalu new therapi continu challeng clinician decisionmak aim gener conceptu framework establish valu criteria evalu treatment mcrc appli framework assess valu trifluridinetipiracil ftdtpi bevacizumab beva advanc line therapi mcrc versu altern method multicriteria decis analysi mcda conduct accord modifi evidem assess framework follow process defin decis problem select structur relat criteria identifi literatur review weight criteria measur perform score altern evalu mcrc therapi catalonia spain expert panel five member experi cancer treatment catalonia involv hierarch nonhierarch weight criteria subcriteria perform evid matrix avail treatment develop expert assign score compar ftdtpi beva versu altern result five valu criteria 18 subcriteria select evalu mcrc therapi accord hierarch method efficaci highest weight follow safeti lower weight rest cost guidelinesexpert consensu epidemiolog efficaci dimens overal surviv os highest weight sever advers event receiv highest score term safeti nonhierarch weight corrobor result treatment ftdtpi beva obtain posit overal valu contribut 091 043 point consid compar criteria compar criteria highli import obtain valu contribut efficaci safeti cost 019 015 012 point respect os 020 progressionfre surviv 019 diseas control rate 016 healthrel qualiti life 016 relev subcriteria conclus base mcda high valu contribut ftdtpi beva suggest substanti benefit use altern
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Posttransplant immunosuppression in kidney transplant recipients is associated with an increased risk of developing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. Various dermatological and immunosuppression modulation strategies have been identified that may reduce the risk of CSCC, both in primary and secondary prevention settings. Recent recommendations have provided consensus regarding dermatological approaches to prevent CSCC. Comparable transplant nephrology recommendations to guide immunosuppression modulation for CSCC prevention are currently lacking, leading to marked variation in practice. METHODS: To address this knowledge gap, 46 international transplant nephrology experts participated in a 3-round Delphi survey to develop consensus recommendations for CSCC secondary prevention based on the actinic damage and skin cancer index stages of CSCC. RESULTS: The panel of experts reached consensus to consider a change in immunosuppression after multiple low-risk invasive CSCC (stage 5a, 1/y >3 y) and encouraged collaboration with dermatology to optimize dermatologic preventative care after the first CSCC. There was also consensus to prioritize azathioprine modification where this is present in an immunosuppressive regimen. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first international consensus recommendations for management of immunosuppression in kidney transplant recipients at discrete stages of CSCC. Additional prospective studies are necessary to determine the optimal management of immunosuppression in this patient population. These recommendations have been endorsed by the Board of the American Society of Transplantation.",background posttranspl immunosuppress kidney transplant recipi associ increas risk develop cutan squamou cell carcinoma cscc contribut signific morbid mortal variou dermatolog immunosuppress modul strategi identifi may reduc risk cscc primari secondari prevent set recent recommend provid consensu regard dermatolog approach prevent cscc compar transplant nephrolog recommend guid immunosuppress modul cscc prevent current lack lead mark variat practic method address knowledg gap 46 intern transplant nephrolog expert particip 3round delphi survey develop consensu recommend cscc secondari prevent base actin damag skin cancer index stage cscc result panel expert reach consensu consid chang immunosuppress multipl lowrisk invas cscc stage 5a 1y 3 encourag collabor dermatolog optim dermatolog prevent care first cscc also consensu priorit azathioprin modif present immunosuppress regimen conclus studi provid first intern consensu recommend manag immunosuppress kidney transplant recipi discret stage cscc addit prospect studi necessari determin optim manag immunosuppress patient popul recommend endors board american societi transplant
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular interaction patterns between CD46/TREM1 and LC3B/ATG5 in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), providing novel targets for elucidating the mechanism of inflammatory-to-cancer progression and for the early diagnosis and treatment of OSCC. METHODS: An oral inflammation-to-cancer progression animal model was established using 4-Nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO) drinking water and/or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Clinical oral leukoplakia (OLK), OSCC, and adjacent non-cancerous tissues were collected. Immunohistochemistry assessed CD46, TREM1, LC3B, ATG5 protein expression and PI3K-AKT/TNF pathway alterations in animal and clinical tissues. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) measured inflammatory cytokine levels in serum and saliva. High-throughput sequencing analyzed key pathways. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry revealed elevated CD46/TREM1 expression and reduced LC3B/ATG5 expression in OSCC tissues (P < 0.05). Serum levels of IL-6, IL-8, and GROalpha/CXCL1 progressively increased with advancing inflammation-to-cancer progression in rats, whereas salivary expression peaks occurred during the inflammatory phase. In human saliva and serum, TNF-alpha, IL-8, and IL-6 exhibited an increasing trend among healthy individuals, oral leukoplakia patients, and OSCC patients (P < 0.05). Transcriptome analysis revealed a significant increase in differentially expressed genes during the transformation from OLK to OSCC, predominantly downregulated genes. Among these, Col4a6 and Csf2 genes participated in inflammation-to-cancer progression by regulating the PI3K-Akt and TNF pathways. CONCLUSION: CD46 and TREM1 are highly expressed in OSCC and serve as key initiating factors in the progression from OLK to OSCC. Bioinformatics analysis identified critical candidate genes (Col4a6, Csf2) and pathways (PI3K-Akt, TNF) in inflammation-to-cancer conversion. Activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is associated with inhibited autophagy and malignant progression of OSCC. Additionally, inflammation-to-cancer transition is a core mechanism in the development of OSCC, with the tumor inflammatory microenvironment acting as a ""promoter"" in the progression from OLK to OSCC. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms and targeted therapies for OSCC, holding significant theoretical and clinical application value.",object investig molecular interact pattern cd46trem1 lc3batg5 develop oral squamou cell carcinoma oscc provid novel target elucid mechan inflammatorytocanc progress earli diagnosi treatment oscc method oral inflammationtocanc progress anim model establish use 4nitroquinolinenoxid 4nqo drink water andor lipopolysaccharid lp clinic oral leukoplakia olk oscc adjac noncancer tissu collect immunohistochemistri assess cd46 trem1 lc3b atg5 protein express pi3kakttnf pathway alter anim clinic tissu enzymelink immunosorb assay elisa measur inflammatori cytokin level serum saliva highthroughput sequenc analyz key pathway result immunohistochemistri reveal elev cd46trem1 express reduc lc3batg5 express oscc tissu p 005 serum level il6 il8 groalphacxcl1 progress increas advanc inflammationtocanc progress rat wherea salivari express peak occur inflammatori phase human saliva serum tnfalpha il8 il6 exhibit increas trend among healthi individu oral leukoplakia patient oscc patient p 005 transcriptom analysi reveal signific increas differenti express gene transform olk oscc predominantli downregul gene among col4a6 csf2 gene particip inflammationtocanc progress regul pi3kakt tnf pathway conclus cd46 trem1 highli express oscc serv key initi factor progress olk oscc bioinformat analysi identifi critic candid gene col4a6 csf2 pathway pi3kakt tnf inflammationtocanc convers activ pi3kaktmtor pathway associ inhibit autophagi malign progress oscc addit inflammationtocanc transit core mechan develop oscc tumor inflammatori microenviron act promot progress olk oscc studi provid novel insight molecular mechan target therapi oscc hold signific theoret clinic applic valu
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Current sun safety advice focuses on minimizing exposure to sunlight, due to the relationship between ultraviolet radiation and skin cancer. However, sunlight also has beneficial effects, and there are calls for guidance to reflect these alongside the harmful effects. To examine the net effect of harmful and beneficial aspects, we aimed to determine the association between sunlight exposure and all-cause mortality. Additionally, we examined cause-specific mortality and whether the associations varied according to skin type/colour or ethnicity. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review, searching MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Nov 2023) for reports of epidemiological studies in the general population investigating the effect of long-term sun exposure on all-cause, cardiovascular-related, or cancer-related mortality. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the findings and assessed risk of bias using the ROBINS-E tool. PROSPERO: CRD42023474157. RESULTS: The search identified 73 eligible articles, with 55 included in the narrative synthesis. Methods of measuring sunlight exposure comprised radiation, proxy measures of radiation (e.g., latitude) and behaviour associated with sunlight exposure. The evidence was mixed. While most studies of skin cancer mortality found a higher risk associated with more exposure to sunlight, many studies of other cancers reported lower associated risk. Evidence for all-cause mortality was mixed, as were findings for cardiovascular mortality. Results were subject to high risk of bias, largely due to the likelihood of uncontrolled confounding and the use of indirect measures of sunlight exposure. There were insufficient data regarding any differential effects of sunlight on mortality for those of different skin types/colours or ethnicity. CONCLUSION: Findings from observational epidemiological studies of the association between sunlight exposure and mortality vary across different disease outcome and location being investigated. As such, the findings do not provide a strong rationale for changes to sun protection guidance.",introduct current sun safeti advic focus minim exposur sunlight due relationship ultraviolet radiat skin cancer howev sunlight also benefici effect call guidanc reflect alongsid harm effect examin net effect harm benefici aspect aim determin associ sunlight exposur allcaus mortal addit examin causespecif mortal whether associ vari accord skin typecolour ethnic method conduct systemat review search medlin embas web scienc cochran central regist control trial nov 2023 report epidemiolog studi gener popul investig effect longterm sun exposur allcaus cardiovascularrel cancerrel mortal conduct narr synthesi find assess risk bia use robins tool prospero crd42023474157 result search identifi 73 elig articl 55 includ narr synthesi method measur sunlight exposur compris radiat proxi measur radiat eg latitud behaviour associ sunlight exposur evid mix studi skin cancer mortal found higher risk associ exposur sunlight mani studi cancer report lower associ risk evid allcaus mortal mix find cardiovascular mortal result subject high risk bia larg due likelihood uncontrol confound use indirect measur sunlight exposur insuffici data regard differenti effect sunlight mortal differ skin typescolour ethnic conclus find observ epidemiolog studi associ sunlight exposur mortal vari across differ diseas outcom locat investig find provid strong rational chang sun protect guidanc
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Since 2017, guidelines recommend a four-drug prophylactic antiemetic regimen-5HT3 receptor antagonist (5HT3RA), NK1 receptor antagonist (NK1RA), dexamethasone, and olanzapine-for patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). This study examines prophylactic olanzapine prescribing in patients initiating HEC and associated sociodemographic, clinical, and contextual factors. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using electronic health record data from an academic cancer center and affiliated community practices across the state of North Carolina, joined with geocoded community factors. Adults >/=21 years initiating cisplatin, carmustine, dacarbazine, mechlorethamine, streptozocin, or cyclophosphamide plus anthracycline (AC) in 2022 were included. Antiemetic orders placed before HEC administration were classified as three-drug (5HT3RA, NK1RA, dexamethasone) or four-drug (plus olanzapine). Late olanzapine use (within 30 days post-HEC) was also assessed. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated factors associated with regimen type. RESULTS: Among 878 patients, all received orders for the three-drug regimen, but only 300 (34.2%) had olanzapine ordered within 30 days before first HEC. After adjusting for covariates, olanzapine prescribing was less likely in patients with breast (OR = 0.13, 95%CI = 0.07-0.23), gastrointestinal (OR = 0.20, 95%CI = 0.04-0.94), gynecological (OR = 0.14, 95%CI = 0.03-0.69), and head and neck (OR = 0.17, 95%CI = 0.05-0.66) compared to hematological cancers, in those receiving cisplatin (OR = 0.20, 95%CI = 0.06-0.70) and carmustine (OR = 0.02, 95%CI = 0.00-0.48) compared to AC, and in community (OR = 0.40, 95%CI = 0.27-0.61) versus academic settings. Prescribing was also lower among patients residing in low- (OR = 0.49, 95%CI = 0.25-0.93) or lower-middle income (OR = 0.50, 95%CI = 0.32-0.78) areas, but higher among those living >6 miles from treatment facilities (OR = 1.95, 95%CI = 1.08-3.58).

cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Aotearoa New Zealand's National Cervical Screening Programme uses human papillomavirus (HPV) self-testing. It is important for 25-year-olds to join the cervical screening programme so that cervical cancer can be prevented, detected, and ultimately eliminated, but screening uptake by younger women is low. AIM: The study aimed to hear young women's thoughts, experiences, and knowledge of cervical screening, including their ideas for encouraging participation in the cervical screening programme. METHODS: The study was part of a wider mixed-methods implementation trial based in Te Tai Tokerau. This qualitative component was grounded in a Kaupapa Maori methodology, by, for, and with Maori, involving a structural analysis of inequities and hearing from participants via semi-structured interviews. Interviews with 24 women aged between 18 and 30 and one whanau (family) were undertaken. RESULTS: Data were organised into four pou (pillars): Rangatiratanga (self-determination, autonomy, sovereignty), Manaaki (support, encouragement, whanaungatanga), Kura (education, public health campaigns), and Mana Taurite (equity, access issues, system issues). DISCUSSION: The empowering and easy elements of the HPV self-test, and playing an active part in cervical cancer elimination, encourage young women to participate in cervical screening, but cost is the greatest barrier to screening access. General practice also plays a critical role in championing cervical screening. This has implications for better primary care resourcing to connect and support young women to screening. HPV self-testing in the National Cervical Screening Programme has the opportunity to flip the narrative of cervical screening from burden to action.",introduct aotearoa new zealand nation cervic screen programm use human papillomaviru hpv selftest import 25yearold join cervic screen programm cervic cancer prevent detect ultim elimin screen uptak younger women low aim studi aim hear young women thought experi knowledg cervic screen includ idea encourag particip cervic screen programm method studi part wider mixedmethod implement trial base te tai tokerau qualit compon ground kaupapa maori methodolog maori involv structur analysi inequ hear particip via semistructur interview interview 24 women age 18 30 one whanau famili undertaken result data organis four pou pillar rangatiratanga selfdetermin autonomi sovereignti manaaki support encourag whanaungatanga kura educ public health campaign mana taurit equiti access issu system issu discuss empow easi element hpv selftest play activ part cervic cancer elimin encourag young women particip cervic screen cost greatest barrier screen access gener practic also play critic role champion cervic screen implic better primari care resourc connect support young women screen hpv selftest nation cervic screen programm opportun flip narr cervic screen burden action
cancer,"Methylglyoxal (MGO) and glyoxal (GO) are reactive carbonyl species (RCS) generated as side products in glycolysis and carbohydrate, protein, and fat catabolism, which are enriched in most cancer cells. MGO/GO-induced nonenzymatic glycation on histones plays pathophysiologically important roles in regulating the three-dimensional architecture of cellular chromatin and cancer development. In our previous studies, we have uncovered that enzymes DJ-1 and PAD4 exhibit ""glyoxalase"" and ""deglycase"" activities to antagonize the MGO/GO-modifications of histones. We also found that the general inhibition of histone deacetylases using suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) antagonized histone MGO-glycation due to the direct competition of reactive sites (i.e., lysine residues). Here, we report that a histone deacetylase, sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), functions as a ""semi-deglycase"" that removes lactic and glycolic acids from epsilon-N-l-lactyllysine and hydroxyacetyllysine residues, which are derived from MGO/GO-lysine adducts through the isomerization catalyzed by DJ-1. Overall, SIRT2 is a newly identified regulator for histone glycation, which can prevent the cytotoxicity of MGO and GO by eventually converting them into lactate and glycolate with the assistance of an enzymatically inactive DJ-1 mutant (i.e., DJ-1-C106A).",methylglyox mgo glyoxal go reactiv carbonyl speci rc gener side product glycolysi carbohydr protein fat catabol enrich cancer cell mgogoinduc nonenzymat glycat histon play pathophysiolog import role regul threedimension architectur cellular chromatin cancer develop previou studi uncov enzym dj1 pad4 exhibit glyoxalas deglycas activ antagon mgogomodif histon also found gener inhibit histon deacetylas use suberoylanilid hydroxam acid saha antagon histon mgoglyc due direct competit reactiv site ie lysin residu report histon deacetylas sirtuin 2 sirt2 function semideglycas remov lactic glycol acid epsilonnllactyllysin hydroxyacetyllysin residu deriv mgogolysin adduct isomer catalyz dj1 overal sirt2 newli identifi regul histon glycat prevent cytotox mgo go eventu convert lactat glycol assist enzymat inact dj1 mutant ie dj1c106a

cancer,"Historical redlining, a 1930s residential segregation policy, has been associated with contemporary breast cancer survival, but the role of contemporary neighborhood socioeconomic condition is unclear. We investigated mediating and modifying effects of neighborhood socioeconomic condition. This New York State Cancer Registry-based cohort included 60,773 invasive breast cancer cases. Cases were assigned a historical redlining grade (A-D) through linkage to residential census tract at diagnosis. We used labor class index of concentration at the extremes to proxy neighborhood socioeconomic condition. Four-way decomposition evaluated mediation and modification of neighborhood socioeconomic condition on redlining and breast cancer survival. The total effect (risk ratio, RR) on 5-year mortality from D-grade vs. A-grade =1.20 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.31), which decomposed to a controlled direct effect excess RR (ERR)=0.10 (95% CI: -0.01, 0.21) and a pure indirect effect ERR=0.09 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.13); significant interaction was not detected. Results were consistent among hormone receptor+, local-, and regional-stage tumors, but not HR- or distant-stage tumors. Decomposition differs by race/ethnicity. Contemporary neighborhood socioeconomic condition mediates approximately half the association between historical redlining and all-cause breast cancer survival, while the other half is attributed to historical redlining.

cancer,"Clinical trials have shown that low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening reduces lung cancer mortality among selected groups of ever-smokers. Nordic countries have yet to implement lung cancer screening programs in part due to limited evidence on the associated health and economic consequences. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of LDCT screening compared with no screening for Norwegian individuals aged 50-74 years who ever smoked, using the Dutch-Belgian NELSON screening-eligibility criteria and trial outcomes. In addition, we evaluated the potential need and value of additional research to improve decision-making about LDCT screening implementation. We developed a probabilistic simulation model reflecting the Dutch-Belgian NELSON trial outcomes and Norwegian epidemiological, cost, and health-related quality-of-life data to evaluate long-term (discounted) health and economic consequences from an extended healthcare perspective. Model outputs included sex-stratified clinical and economic outcomes. Cost-effectiveness was summarized using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Compared with no screening, NELSON-like LDCT screening provided an additional 0.043 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per screened man for an additional $1286, yielding an ICER of $30,672 per QALY gained. For women, screening yielded greater health benefits and therefore a lower ICER (i.e., $22,249 per QALY gained), though there was greater uncertainty around health benefits. Additional analyses indicated potential value in collecting further evidence on screening-related outcomes to reduce decision uncertainty, particularly for women. Given Norwegian benchmarks for good value and achieving similar mortality benefits to the NELSON trial, LDCT lung cancer screening for individuals who ever smoked under ""NELSON-like"" criteria may be considered cost-effective for both men and women in Norway.",clinic trial shown lowdos comput tomographi ldct screen reduc lung cancer mortal among select group eversmok nordic countri yet implement lung cancer screen program part due limit evid associ health econom consequ studi evalu costeffect ldct screen compar screen norwegian individu age 5074 year ever smoke use dutchbelgian nelson screeningelig criteria trial outcom addit evalu potenti need valu addit research improv decisionmak ldct screen implement develop probabilist simul model reflect dutchbelgian nelson trial outcom norwegian epidemiolog cost healthrel qualityoflif data evalu longterm discount health econom consequ extend healthcar perspect model output includ sexstratifi clinic econom outcom costeffect summar use increment costeffect ratio icer compar screen nelsonlik ldct screen provid addit 0043 qualityadjust lifeyear qali per screen man addit 1286 yield icer 30672 per qali gain women screen yield greater health benefit therefor lower icer ie 22249 per qali gain though greater uncertainti around health benefit addit analys indic potenti valu collect evid screeningrel outcom reduc decis uncertainti particularli women given norwegian benchmark good valu achiev similar mortal benefit nelson trial ldct lung cancer screen individu ever smoke nelsonlik criteria may consid costeffect men women norway
cancer,"This multicentre real-world study evaluated the efficacy of targeted therapies in Turkish patients with metastatic squamous cell lung carcinoma harbouring driver mutations. Sixty-four patients with alterations such as EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 who received targeted agents were retrospectively analysed. EGFR mutations were most common (67.2%). Among EGFR-TKI-treated patients, median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 12.4 and 14.3 months, respectively. Alectinib yielded a median PFS of 18.6 months and OS of 29.8 months in ALK-positive patients, while crizotinib produced a median PFS and OS of 7 months in ROS1-positive patients. The overall response rate was 50% and the disease control rate 84.4%. Although targeted therapies prolonged PFS compared with chemotherapy, this improvement did not translate into a significant OS advantage, likely influenced by retrospective design and treatment crossover.

cancer,"Peritoneal metastasis (PM), as a terminal stage of malignant tumors with extremely poor prognosis, remains a clinical challenge. Intraperitoneal (IP) administration enhances local drug concentrations, improving survival outcomes for PM patients. However, rapid drug clearance and uneven distribution limit its therapeutic potential. In recent years, hydrogel-based drug delivery systems have garnered attention due to their excellent biocompatibility, drug loading capacity, and controlled release properties. The use of hydrogel-loaded drugs via IP injection can significantly improve anti-cancer efficacy by increasing the local drug concentration, prolonging the retention time of the drug in the peritoneal cavity, and decreasing systemic toxicity. This review summarizes the pathogenesis and current treatment strategies of PM, emphasizing various drugs (including chemotherapy agents, immunotherapeutics, targeted drugs, radioactive isotopes, and herbal medicines) delivered via hydrogel-based IP administration. Furthermore, it highlights the potential of nanoparticles and microparticle-hydrogel composites to further improve drug delivery, offering new strategies for PM treatment and theoretical basis for clinical rational drug use.",periton metastasi pm termin stage malign tumor extrem poor prognosi remain clinic challeng intraperiton ip administr enhanc local drug concentr improv surviv outcom pm patient howev rapid drug clearanc uneven distribut limit therapeut potenti recent year hydrogelbas drug deliveri system garner attent due excel biocompat drug load capac control releas properti use hydrogelload drug via ip inject significantli improv anticanc efficaci increas local drug concentr prolong retent time drug periton caviti decreas system toxic review summar pathogenesi current treatment strategi pm emphas variou drug includ chemotherapi agent immunotherapeut target drug radioact isotop herbal medicin deliv via hydrogelbas ip administr furthermor highlight potenti nanoparticl microparticlehydrogel composit improv drug deliveri offer new strategi pm treatment theoret basi clinic ration drug use
cancer,"We formulated a nanonetwork of an amphiphilic polyurethane integrated with a tertiary amine group on the backbone and a pyridyl disulfide group as a pendant. The disulfide linkages within the nanonetwork undergo reductive cleavage in the intracellular redox environment of cancer cells, enabling sustained and site-specific drug release. The positive surface-charge generation under tumor extracellular matrix-like mildly acidic conditions promotes selective uptake of the nanonetwork by cancer cells while minimizing interaction with normal cells, as shown by flow cytometry analysis. Biological evaluation confirmed selective internalization and potent cytotoxicity in HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cells following treatment with NN@DOX, while normal cells were effectively shielded from off-target toxicity. Furthermore, the dual-drug-loaded nanonetwork (NN@DOX-CPT) exhibited superior therapeutic outcomes, as demonstrated by a significantly lower IC(50) (3.98 mug/mL) value compared to single-drug formulations, NN@DOX (IC(50) = 9.89 mug/mL), confirming a combined effect.

Outcomes remain variable because of biological heterogeneity, treatment resistance and the limited performance of currently available biomarkers. AREAS COVERED: This review synthesizes contemporary standards of care together with advances in tumor biology and biomarker development, and appraises investigational modalities across immune, targeted and cellular platforms. We analyze how standards of care and translational insights have evolved in recent years, outlining the principal directions of current and investigational treatments. EXPERT OPINION: The field is moving toward biology-informed treatment selection. Priorities include prospective validation of biomarker strategies, standardization of assay platforms, and integration of dynamic response measures to refine treatment selection, sequencing and combinations. Molecularly defined subsets and less common histologies warrant dedicated, adequately powered studies. With rigorous methodology and standardized testing methods, emerging approaches have the potential to translate current signals into more consistent and durable clinical benefit in RCC.",introduct rcc manag evolv toward immunotherapybas strategi adjuv anti pd1 therapi nephrectomi immun vegf tki combin metastat set repres standard care outcom remain variabl biolog heterogen treatment resist limit perform current avail biomark area cover review synthes contemporari standard care togeth advanc tumor biolog biomark develop apprais investig modal across immun target cellular platform analyz standard care translat insight evolv recent year outlin princip direct current investig treatment expert opinion field move toward biologyinform treatment select prioriti includ prospect valid biomark strategi standard assay platform integr dynam respons measur refin treatment select sequenc combin molecularli defin subset less common histolog warrant dedic adequ power studi rigor methodolog standard test method emerg approach potenti translat current signal consist durabl clinic benefit rcc
cancer,"Despite a steady decline in incidence, tuberculosis (TB) remains a substantial public health burden in South Korea, particularly among older adults. Existing national TB surveillance systems lack sufficiently comprehensive data to assess long-term outcomes and health disparities. The K-TB-N cohort integrates data from 3 national sources: the Korean Tuberculosis Surveillance System (2011-2022), the National Health Insurance Database (2010-2022), and mortality data from Statistics Korea (2010-2022). After data cleaning and linkage, the final cohort included 373,812 patients with either drug-susceptible or drug-resistant TB. TB notifications declined by approximately 60% over the study period, while the median patient age continued to rise. Treatment success improved over time, accompanied by reductions in loss to follow-up. However, mortality during treatment increased, with more than half of deaths attributed to non-TB causes such as pneumonia, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Post-treatment mortality also remained high, particularly among patients with drug-resistant TB. The K-TB-N cohort provides a comprehensive, linked dataset for advancing research on TB epidemiology, treatment outcomes, comorbidities, and health disparities. It enables evaluations of public health interventions, long-term prognosis, and strategies for post-TB care.

cancer,"Bivalent chromatin maintains genes in low-expression, poised states in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, bivalent promoters correlate with the transcriptional activation of oncogenic programs in malignancies, a seemingly contradiction that remains to be resolved. Here, we identify a class of cancer-specific bivalent promoters (CSBPs) through the integration of a system-level longitudinal framework. Compared with ESCs, CSBPs are characterized by lower and narrower H3K27me3 deposition alongside abundant H3K4me3, thus permitting the persistent expression of genes critical for cancer stem cell (CSC) formation and maintenance, as exemplified by SOX9. The generation of CSBPs is essentially induced by the acquisition of H3K27me3 during cell state transition, which is mediated by specific binding of PRC2.1 and the de novo recruitment of PRC2.2. Notably, disrupting the bivalency of CSBPs significantly increases H3K4me3 levels, leading to hyperactivation of CSBPs and eventually inhibiting clonal expansion of CSCs and impairing tumorigenesis. Our study not only helps explain the puzzle of transcriptionally active bivalent genes in cancer but also provides insights into the development of therapies targeting phenotypic plasticity.",bival chromatin maintain gene lowexpress pois state embryon stem cell esc howev bival promot correl transcript activ oncogen program malign seemingli contradict remain resolv identifi class cancerspecif bival promot csbp integr systemlevel longitudin framework compar esc csbp character lower narrow h3k27me3 deposit alongsid abund h3k4me3 thu permit persist express gene critic cancer stem cell csc format mainten exemplifi sox9 gener csbp essenti induc acquisit h3k27me3 cell state transit mediat specif bind prc21 de novo recruit prc22 notabl disrupt bival csbp significantli increas h3k4me3 level lead hyperactiv csbp eventu inhibit clonal expans csc impair tumorigenesi studi help explain puzzl transcript activ bival gene cancer also provid insight develop therapi target phenotyp plastic
cancer,"PURPOSE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) lung metastases exhibit high recurrence rates after resection, underscoring the need for improved therapeutic strategies. This study aimed to characterize the tumor microenvironment (TME) of CRC lung metastases and identify the factors associated with recurrence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen CRC patients who underwent lung metastasectomy were enrolled. Multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC), whole exome sequencing, transcriptome profiling, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) were conducted on matched tumor, adjacent and distant normal lung tissues. Immune cell populations and gene expression profiles were analyzed and correlated with clinical recurrence outcomes. RESULTS: Exome and transcriptome analyses revealed frequent TP53, KRAS, and APC mutations. Most tumors corresponded to consensus molecular subtypes 2 and 4, characterized by immune-depleted and fibrotic features. Tumors showed downregulation of effector T and NK cell signatures. IHC revealed reduced density and increased distance of CD8+ T cells and macrophages from the epithelial cells. scRNA-seq demonstrated increased regulatory T cells and decreased NK and effector T cells in tumor. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), particularly SPP1 (osteopontin)-expressing subsets, were markedly enriched in tumor and correlated with suppressed effector T cella activity. High SPP1 expression was associated with early recurrence and poor overall survival. Patients with recurrence had higher proportion of PD-1+ CD8+ T cells in adjacent normal tissues. CONCLUSION: Immunosuppressive features including enrichment of SPP1+ TAMs and depletion of effector T and NK cells contribute to recurrence after CRC lung metastasectomy. Therapeutic strategies targeting both TAMs and T cells may enhance clinical outcomes in this patient population.",purpos colorect cancer crc lung metastas exhibit high recurr rate resect underscor need improv therapeut strategi studi aim character tumor microenviron tme crc lung metastas identifi factor associ recurr materi method fifteen crc patient underw lung metastasectomi enrol multiplex immunohistochemistri ihc whole exom sequenc transcriptom profil singlecel rna sequenc scrnaseq conduct match tumor adjac distant normal lung tissu immun cell popul gene express profil analyz correl clinic recurr outcom result exom transcriptom analys reveal frequent tp53 kra apc mutat tumor correspond consensu molecular subtyp 2 4 character immunedeplet fibrot featur tumor show downregul effector nk cell signatur ihc reveal reduc densiti increas distanc cd8 cell macrophag epitheli cell scrnaseq demonstr increas regulatori cell decreas nk effector cell tumor tumorassoci macrophag tam particularli spp1 osteopontinexpress subset markedli enrich tumor correl suppress effector cella activ high spp1 express associ earli recurr poor overal surviv patient recurr higher proport pd1 cd8 cell adjac normal tissu conclus immunosuppress featur includ enrich spp1 tam deplet effector nk cell contribut recurr crc lung metastasectomi therapeut strategi target tam cell may enhanc clinic outcom patient popul
cancer,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) has evolved from a poor prognostic factor to one of the most impactful predictive biomarkers in oncology. The introduction of trastuzumab established HER2 as a binary determinant of therapy, with HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) becoming the treatment-guiding diagnostic assay. However, the emergence of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), particularly trastuzumab deruxtecan, has challenged this paradigm by demonstrating activity in tumors with low and even ultralow HER2 expression. This review outlines the evolution of HER2 testing, from its historical discovery and early assay variability to the ADC era, where categories such as HER2-low and HER2-ultralow have emerged. We highlight key challenges: poor reproducibility at the lower end of IHC scoring, instability of HER2 status across timepoints and between primary and metastatic tumors, and no consistent biological distinction between low, ultralow, and null. Efforts to improve reliability-including structured training, high-sensitivity assays, RNA-based methods, and artificial intelligence-assisted pathology-are summarized. Finally, we reconsider the therapeutic implications of ADCs, with the question of whether the benefit parallels HER2 expression or extends into HER2-null disease. HER2 exemplifies how biomarker interpretation evolves with drug development. As new ADCs target additional antigens, pathologists must balance trial-driven categories with biologic reproducibility to ensure diagnostics remain aligned with therapeutic advances.",human epiderm growth factor receptor 2 her2 evolv poor prognost factor one impact predict biomark oncolog introduct trastuzumab establish her2 binari determin therapi her2 immunohistochemistri ihc becom treatmentguid diagnost assay howev emerg antibodydrug conjug adc particularli trastuzumab deruxtecan challeng paradigm demonstr activ tumor low even ultralow her2 express review outlin evolut her2 test histor discoveri earli assay variabl adc era categori her2low her2ultralow emerg highlight key challeng poor reproduc lower end ihc score instabl her2 statu across timepoint primari metastat tumor consist biolog distinct low ultralow null effort improv reliabilityinclud structur train highsensit assay rnabas method artifici intelligenceassist pathologyar summar final reconsid therapeut implic adc question whether benefit parallel her2 express extend her2nul diseas her2 exemplifi biomark interpret evolv drug develop new adc target addit antigen pathologist must balanc trialdriven categori biolog reproduc ensur diagnost remain align therapeut advanc
cancer,"PURPOSE: The Asia Pacific region is marked by healthcare diversity and economic disparity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To understand the utilization and reimbursement practices of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and other sequencing methods relevant to oncology clinical practice in the region, a semi-structured survey was undertaken of respondents from 11 countries represented by the Korean Society of Medical Oncology (KSMO) 2024 Young Oncologist Forum alumni. RESULTS: While 79% of respondents reported access to NGS at their institution, full government reimbursement was uncommon and varied by test type and clinical setting. Japan and South Korea offered the most comprehensive public coverage, including for circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA)-based liquid biopsy. Lower- and upper-middle-income countries, such as the Philippines, Indonesia, and India, reported no government reimbursement, thus relying on user-pay methods or private insurance payments. One marked barrier to NGS reimbursement was the prohibitive cost of tests (100%), followed by a limited budget to fund testing (79%), and then by policy or regulatory restrictions (50%). On a similar note, insurance coverage (93%) and patient income (86%) were key concerns regarding access and equity to tests. Test reimbursement (or lack thereof) and cost were cited almost universally as the most elevated concerns by the respondents. CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrated a wide disparity in access, funding and reimbursement of sequencing tests across the region. Addressing cost, improving reimbursement mechanisms, and building infrastructure capacity will be critical for the equitable integration of NGS into routine cancer care in the Asia-Pacific.",purpos asia pacif region mark healthcar divers econom dispar materi method understand util reimburs practic nextgener sequenc ng sequenc method relev oncolog clinic practic region semistructur survey undertaken respond 11 countri repres korean societi medic oncolog ksmo 2024 young oncologist forum alumni result 79 respond report access ng institut full govern reimburs uncommon vari test type clinic set japan south korea offer comprehens public coverag includ circul tumor deoxyribonucl acid ctdnabas liquid biopsi lower uppermiddleincom countri philippin indonesia india report govern reimburs thu reli userpay method privat insur payment one mark barrier ng reimburs prohibit cost test 100 follow limit budget fund test 79 polici regulatori restrict 50 similar note insur coverag 93 patient incom 86 key concern regard access equiti test test reimburs lack thereof cost cite almost univers elev concern respond conclus find demonstr wide dispar access fund reimburs sequenc test across region address cost improv reimburs mechan build infrastructur capac critic equit integr ng routin cancer care asiapacif
cancer,"BACKGROUND: To determine if dose escalation improves outcomes for chondrosarcomas (CHS) of the base of the skull (BOS) and the cervical spine (CS). METHODS: A prospective, randomized, dose-escalation trial was designed for patients with CHS of the BOS and CS. Patients were randomly assigned to 70 Gy (RBE) or 76 Gy (RBE). The primary endpoint was local failure (LF). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), progression-free survival (PFS), and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS: Between 1987 and 2007, 105 patients were randomized, median follow-up was 29.2 years (IQR, 26.7-32.4). Forty-six patients were assigned to 70 Gy (RBE) and fifty-nine were assigned to 76 Gy (RBE). LF at 5-, 10-, and 20 years were 7%, 9%, and 11% for 70 Gy (RBE), and 10%, 15%, and 19% for 76 Gy (RBE) (p = 0.16). Like LF rates, there was no benefit in dose escalation for OS (p = 0.28) and CSS (p = 0.22). Progression-free survival at 5-, 10-, and 20 years was 93%, 89%, and 77% for the low-dose group and 83%, 71%, and 59% for the high-dose group (p = 0.069). Late RT injury >/= grade 3 was reported in a total of 19 (18%) patients across both dose levels, with 11% in the low-dose group and 24% in the high-dose group (p = 0.13). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first and largest trial of patients with grade I/II BOS and CS CHS evaluating dose escalation for tumor control. Proton-based RT is effective and safe for these tumors, but there is no apparent benefit in dose escalation.",background determin dose escal improv outcom chondrosarcoma ch base skull bo cervic spine cs method prospect random doseescal trial design patient ch bo cs patient randomli assign 70 gy rbe 76 gy rbe primari endpoint local failur lf secondari endpoint includ overal surviv os cancerspecif surviv css progressionfre surviv pf treatmentrel toxic result 1987 2007 105 patient random median followup 292 year iqr 267324 fortysix patient assign 70 gy rbe fiftynin assign 76 gy rbe lf 5 10 20 year 7 9 11 70 gy rbe 10 15 19 76 gy rbe p 016 like lf rate benefit dose escal os p 028 css p 022 progressionfre surviv 5 10 20 year 93 89 77 lowdos group 83 71 59 highdos group p 0069 late rt injuri grade 3 report total 19 18 patient across dose level 11 lowdos group 24 highdos group p 013 conclus first largest trial patient grade iii bo cs ch evalu dose escal tumor control protonbas rt effect safe tumor appar benefit dose escal
cancer,"Numerous scientific studies have established that the BCG vaccination reduces susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections, particularly those causing respiratory tract ailments. This effect is partly attributed to the crossreactivity of BCG antigens, which reinforces immunity and presents an important avenue for therapeutic interventions against bladder cancer, Buruli ulcer, and leprosy. Remarkably, individuals residing in tuberculosis (TB)-endemic regions who have received BCG vaccinations exhibit a significant reduction in the incidence of monkeypox virus (MPV) infections. This observation could be attributed to shared T-cell and B-cell epitopes between mycobacteria and MPV, raising the possibility of eliciting cross-reactive immune responses. Such cross-reactivity could account for the enhanced protection conferred by the BCG vaccination against MPV infections. To explore this possibility, we employed advanced immunoinformatics tools. Our analysis successfully identified common CD4 T-cell, CD8 T-cell, and B-cell epitopes shared between MPV and mycobacteria. Notably, the T-cell epitopes demonstrated high immunogenicity and substantial affinity, with promiscuous binding to multiple human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and class II alleles, indicating the potential for these epitopes to trigger robust immune responses. Indeed, the predicted outcomes encompassed the induction of Th1-cell and Th2-cell responses via the predicted epitopes. These findings carry profound implications. They imply that prior exposure to cross-reactive mycobacterial antigens during recent pandemics could have contributed to increased levels of protection against MPV infections in TB-endemic regions, in contrast to areas non-endemic for TB. The identified T-cell and B-cell epitopes may thus serve as promising candidates for developing vaccines to combat MPV and mitigate its spread.",numer scientif studi establish bcg vaccin reduc suscept bacteri viral infect particularli caus respiratori tract ailment effect partli attribut crossreact bcg antigen reinforc immun present import avenu therapeut intervent bladder cancer buruli ulcer leprosi remark individu resid tuberculosi tbendem region receiv bcg vaccin exhibit signific reduct incid monkeypox viru mpv infect observ could attribut share tcell bcell epitop mycobacteria mpv rais possibl elicit crossreact immun respons crossreact could account enhanc protect confer bcg vaccin mpv infect explor possibl employ advanc immunoinformat tool analysi success identifi common cd4 tcell cd8 tcell bcell epitop share mpv mycobacteria notabl tcell epitop demonstr high immunogen substanti affin promiscu bind multipl human leukocyt antigen hla class class ii allel indic potenti epitop trigger robust immun respons inde predict outcom encompass induct th1cell th2cell respons via predict epitop find carri profound implic impli prior exposur crossreact mycobacteri antigen recent pandem could contribut increas level protect mpv infect tbendem region contrast area nonendem tb identifi tcell bcell epitop may thu serv promis candid develop vaccin combat mpv mitig spread
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN) is a dose-limiting adverse effect during paclitaxel therapy, with no effective treatment and often incomplete recovery. This study assessed the effects of exercise on PIPN severity in newly diagnosed advanced breast cancer patients. METHODS: The ExPIN Trial is an ongoing randomized clinical trial. This interim analysis, conducted between November 2022 and December 2023, included adult patients with locally advanced, non-metastatic breast cancer. Participants were randomized into interventional and control groups for 0 to 12 weeks. The primary outcome was nerve conduction studies. Secondary outcomes included balance scores, taxane-induced toxicity-related quality-of-life scores, emotional functioning, physical functioning, and functional impairments assessed at baseline, after chemotherapy, and at the first follow-up. RESULTS: Seventy patients were randomized. The mean (SD) age was 49.46 (9.52) years in the interventional group and 49.09 (8.10) years in the control group. At the completion of paclitaxel therapy, the amplitudes of the ulnar nerve (estimate: 1.98, P = .007), common peroneal nerve (estimate: 1.88, P = .003), and sural nerve (estimate: 6.20, P < .001) were significantly higher in the interventional group. On the EORTC scale (lower scores indicate better quality of life), sensory and motor scores significantly decreased in the interventional group by the end of therapy (-5.46 and -3.82, P < .001), indicating improvement. These improvements were sustained at follow-up (-1.99, P = .001, and -4.20, P < .001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Exercise intervention during paclitaxel therapy significantly reduced PIPN severity and improved quality of life. Findings are preliminary and warrant further confirmation.",background paclitaxelinduc peripher neuropathi pipn doselimit advers effect paclitaxel therapi effect treatment often incomplet recoveri studi assess effect exercis pipn sever newli diagnos advanc breast cancer patient method expin trial ongo random clinic trial interim analysi conduct novemb 2022 decemb 2023 includ adult patient local advanc nonmetastat breast cancer particip random intervent control group 0 12 week primari outcom nerv conduct studi secondari outcom includ balanc score taxaneinduc toxicityrel qualityoflif score emot function physic function function impair assess baselin chemotherapi first followup result seventi patient random mean sd age 4946 952 year intervent group 4909 810 year control group complet paclitaxel therapi amplitud ulnar nerv estim 198 p 007 common peron nerv estim 188 p 003 sural nerv estim 620 p 001 significantli higher intervent group eortc scale lower score indic better qualiti life sensori motor score significantli decreas intervent group end therapi 546 382 p 001 indic improv improv sustain followup 199 p 001 420 p 001 respect conclus exercis intervent paclitaxel therapi significantli reduc pipn sever improv qualiti life find preliminari warrant confirm
cancer,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) is one of the most essential metabolites in cell metabolism but its function and concentration in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains elusive and controversial. METHODS: A comprehensive analysis of acetyl-CoA levels and ACSS2 expression across a range of samples, including patient specimens from both HBV positive and HBV negative HCC individuals, HBV-transgenic mouse HCC models, and multiple cell lines. Furthermore, to evaluate the functional significance of ACSS2 in HBV-related HCC, we implemented both genetic and pharmacological inhibition strategies targeting ACSS2. Molecular mechanism and mitophagy assessment were revealed by CUT &Tag, RNA sequencing, bioinformatic analyses, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and JC-1 staining. RESULTS: Our study revealed a distinct metabolic signature of HBV-related HCC, marked by elevated acetyl-CoA, which was driven by acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2). ACSS2 was upregulated by the carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) in HBV-related HCC. Furthermore, ACSS2 improved tumor cell proliferation, an effect that was dependent on its enzymatic activity. Mechanistically, ACSS2-induced acetyl-CoA accumulation activated voltage-dependent anion channels 1 (VDAC1) transcription through increased H3K27ac occupancy, which subsequently promoted mitophagy and HBV-related HCC tumorigenesis. Notably, targeting ACSS2 by depletion or inhibition with a catalytic inhibitor significantly suppressed tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: These findings not only illustrate the interplay between metabolic reprogramming, epigenetic modification, and tumorigenesis in the context of HBV infection, but also highlight ACSS2 as a novel metabolic vulnerability in HBV-related HCC. Therefore, targeting ACSS2 could be a novel strategy against HBV-associated HCC.",backgroundaim acetyl coenzym acetylcoa one essenti metabolit cell metabol function concentr hepatocellular carcinoma hcc remain elus controversi method comprehens analysi acetylcoa level acss2 express across rang sampl includ patient specimen hbv posit hbv neg hcc individu hbvtransgen mous hcc model multipl cell line furthermor evalu function signific acss2 hbvrelat hcc implement genet pharmacolog inhibit strategi target acss2 molecular mechan mitophagi assess reveal cut tag rna sequenc bioinformat analys transmiss electron microscopi tem jc1 stain result studi reveal distinct metabol signatur hbvrelat hcc mark elev acetylcoa driven acetylcoa synthetas 2 acss2 acss2 upregul carbohydr respons elementbind protein chrebp hbvrelat hcc furthermor acss2 improv tumor cell prolifer effect depend enzymat activ mechanist acss2induc acetylcoa accumul activ voltagedepend anion channel 1 vdac1 transcript increas h3k27ac occup subsequ promot mitophagi hbvrelat hcc tumorigenesi notabl target acss2 deplet inhibit catalyt inhibitor significantli suppress tumor growth conclus find illustr interplay metabol reprogram epigenet modif tumorigenesi context hbv infect also highlight acss2 novel metabol vulner hbvrelat hcc therefor target acss2 could novel strategi hbvassoci hcc
cancer,"PURPOSE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the relationship between ovarian and colorectal cancer, with a particular focus on the standardized incidence ratio (SIR). METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases, including Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar. A total of 20 studies were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: The results indicated that women with ovarian cancer had a significantly higher incidence of colorectal cancer (SIR, 1.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39-1.98), with an increased risk for both colon (SIR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.14-1.99) and rectal cancers (SIR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.38-1.78). Subgroup analysis of borderline ovarian tumor revealed an SIR for colorectal cancer of 1.27 (95% CI, 0.99-1.55), with a significant risk in the serous subtype (SIR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.09-1.67). Conversely, studies examining ovarian cancer in women diagnosed with colorectal cancer showed an SIR of 1.48 (95% CI, 1.17-1.79). Specifically, women with colon cancer had a higher incidence of ovarian cancer (SIR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.25-2.03), while women with rectal cancer showed a decreased risk (SIR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77-0.99). The results underscore the potential bidirectional relationship between ovarian and colorectal cancers, which may be influenced by genetic predispositions. CONCLUSION: Future advanced genetic studies are needed to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms. Additionally, the results emphasize the importance of careful cancer surveillance and early detection strategies for women with a history of either ovarian cancer or colorectal cancer.",purpos systemat review metaanalysi aim examin relationship ovarian colorect cancer particular focu standard incid ratio sir method comprehens search conduct across multipl databas includ scopu web scienc pubm googl scholar total 20 studi includ final analysi result result indic women ovarian cancer significantli higher incid colorect cancer sir 169 95 confid interv ci 139198 increas risk colon sir 157 95 ci 114199 rectal cancer sir 158 95 ci 138178 subgroup analysi borderlin ovarian tumor reveal sir colorect cancer 127 95 ci 099155 signific risk serou subtyp sir 138 95 ci 109167 convers studi examin ovarian cancer women diagnos colorect cancer show sir 148 95 ci 117179 specif women colon cancer higher incid ovarian cancer sir 164 95 ci 125203 women rectal cancer show decreas risk sir 088 95 ci 077099 result underscor potenti bidirect relationship ovarian colorect cancer may influenc genet predisposit conclus futur advanc genet studi need better understand underli molecular mechan addit result emphas import care cancer surveil earli detect strategi women histori either ovarian cancer colorect cancer
cancer,"Recently, cancer rates have increased among women of reproductive age. As a result, chemotherapy exposure is a common cause of premature ovarian failure (POF). The present study evaluated Losartan's protective effects against cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced POF. Forty female nulligravid Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Rats were randomly placed in four groups: Group I (control group); Group II (losartan group); received Losartan 100 mg/kg daily by gavage orally for thirty days; Group III (POF group): POF was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg of CP on day one of the experiment and then 8 mg/kg/day for fifteen serial days; Group IV (Losartan + POF group): received losartan 100 mg/kg daily for thirty days one hour before CP intraperitoneal dosage of 50 mg/kg on the first day of the experiment and then CP has given in a dose of 8 mg/kg/day for fifteen successive days. Physiological sera of blood and tissue samples were evaluated biochemically, hormonally, and histopathologically at the end of the experiment. Losartan treatment improved E2, FSH, LH, and oxidative stress biomarkers.Furthermore, coadministration of the Losartan to the POF group exhibited a significant lessening in systolic blood pressure, a significant improvement in ovarian blood flow velocity, and a significant decline in ovarian vascular resistance related to the POF group. Furthermore, Losartan reduced the histopathological and immunohistochemical alterations, enhanced SIRT1 gene expression, and decreased NF-kappaB gene expression. Our findings suggest that Losartan protects rats from cyclophosphamide-induced ovarian toxicity.",recent cancer rate increas among women reproduct age result chemotherapi exposur common caus prematur ovarian failur pof present studi evalu losartan protect effect cyclophosphamid cpinduc pof forti femal nulligravid spraguedawley rat use rat randomli place four group group control group group ii losartan group receiv losartan 100 mgkg daili gavag oral thirti day group iii pof group pof induc intraperiton inject 50 mgkg cp day one experi 8 mgkgday fifteen serial day group iv losartan pof group receiv losartan 100 mgkg daili thirti day one hour cp intraperiton dosag 50 mgkg first day experi cp given dose 8 mgkgday fifteen success day physiolog sera blood tissu sampl evalu biochem hormon histopatholog end experi losartan treatment improv e2 fsh lh oxid stress biomarkersfurthermor coadministr losartan pof group exhibit signific lessen systol blood pressur signific improv ovarian blood flow veloc signific declin ovarian vascular resist relat pof group furthermor losartan reduc histopatholog immunohistochem alter enhanc sirt1 gene express decreas nfkappab gene express find suggest losartan protect rat cyclophosphamideinduc ovarian toxic
cancer,"The Mediator complex is a transcriptional co-factor for RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-dependent gene expression, with MED19 serving as an integral subunit. While MED19 overexpression has been documented in diverse cancer types to promote tumor progression, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we uncover a previously unrecognized function whereby MED19 localizes to the nucleolus independently of the Mediator complex. This nucleolar targeting is mediated by a conserved poly-lysine motif at the MED19 C-terminus, which enables binding to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and fibrillarin (FBL), a catalytic component of the 2'-O-methyltransferase complex and pre-rRNA processing factor. Mechanistically, MED19 facilitates rRNA processing and 2'-O-methylation that promotes the efficiency of internal ribosome entry site-dependent translation for a number of onco-promoting genes including c-Myc. Collectively, these findings reveal a novel Mediator-independent function of MED19 in regulating ribosome-mediated translational control, thus providing mechanistic insights into its onco-promoting role.",mediat complex transcript cofactor rna polymeras ii pol iidepend gene express med19 serv integr subunit med19 overexpress document divers cancer type promot tumor progress underli molecular mechan remain poorli understood uncov previous unrecogn function wherebi med19 local nucleolu independ mediat complex nucleolar target mediat conserv polylysin motif med19 cterminu enabl bind ribosom rna rrna fibrillarin fbl catalyt compon 2omethyltransferas complex prerrna process factor mechanist med19 facilit rrna process 2omethyl promot effici intern ribosom entri sitedepend translat number oncopromot gene includ cmyc collect find reveal novel mediatorindepend function med19 regul ribosomemedi translat control thu provid mechanist insight oncopromot role
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Achieving cervical cancer (CC) elimination requires addressing disparities in CC burden for women living with HIV (WLHIV) and how disparities evolve in the context of antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up. To inform CC elimination for high HIV prevalence regions, we modeled the impact of HIV, HIV interventions, and CC interventions in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. METHODS: We used two independently developed, dynamic compartmental transmission models of HIV and HPV (DRIVE and Policy1-Cervix-HIV) calibrated to KwaZulu-Natal. We simulated a counterfactual without HIV but with observed CC screening and vaccination; and scenarios sequentially adding condom use and voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC); HIV; observed HIV and CC interventions (status quo); achieving UNAIDS HIV treatment targets; and achieving WHO CC elimination targets. The impact of each scenario was measured as the difference in CC incidence from the previous scenario. Results were reported from 2024-2124 as a range between the two models; CC elimination was WHO-defined as incidence <4/100,000 women-years. RESULTS: For the status quo, CC incidence ranged from 61.30-78.96/100,000 women-years in 2024, with the highest incidence among WLHIV (126.8-192.0/100,000). HIV contributed an estimated 29.08-48.87 additional cases per 100,000. Neither model predicted elimination under status quo interventions, but achieving HIV treatment and CC elimination targets could reduce incidence to 1.42-6.25/100,000 women-years in 2124. CONCLUSIONS: HIV is associated with a population-level increase in CC incidence. However, scaling up ART coverage and CC interventions is expected to significantly reduce the burden of CC overall and among WLHIV. These conclusions are consistent between both models and strengthened by the comparative modeling approach.",background achiev cervic cancer cc elimin requir address dispar cc burden women live hiv wlhiv dispar evolv context antiretrovir therapi art scaleup inform cc elimin high hiv preval region model impact hiv hiv intervent cc intervent kwazulunat south africa method use two independ develop dynam compartment transmiss model hiv hpv drive policy1cervixhiv calibr kwazulunat simul counterfactu without hiv observ cc screen vaccin scenario sequenti ad condom use voluntari medic male circumcis vmmc hiv observ hiv cc intervent statu quo achiev unaid hiv treatment target achiev cc elimin target impact scenario measur differ cc incid previou scenario result report 20242124 rang two model cc elimin whodefin incid 4100000 womenyear result statu quo cc incid rang 61307896100000 womenyear 2024 highest incid among wlhiv 12681920100000 hiv contribut estim 29084887 addit case per 100000 neither model predict elimin statu quo intervent achiev hiv treatment cc elimin target could reduc incid 142625100000 womenyear 2124 conclus hiv associ populationlevel increas cc incid howev scale art coverag cc intervent expect significantli reduc burden cc overal among wlhiv conclus consist model strengthen compar model approach
cancer,"C-reactive protein (CRP) is a biomarker that significantly elevates in cancer patients. Its detection with high sensitivity and specificity is of paramount importance for the early diagnosis and screening of cancer. In this study, we proposed and experimentally demonstrated a CRP antibody-functionalized metasurface biosensor with a simplified metallic design, enabling high-sensitivity detection of CRP using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. Colloidal gold nanoparticles enhance the sensitivity and quantitative detection capabilities of the biosensor by leveraging the local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect and the enhanced biomolecular recognition. Moreover, the addition of a high concentration of CRP antibodies improves the antigen capture efficiency, thereby further boosting the sensor's performance. In this study, the designed biosensor was used to measure varying concentrations of CRP and two different types of antigens. By analyzing the sensor's response variations under different antigen-binding conditions, the specificity of its CRP recognition was validated. Experimental results demonstrated that the sensor exhibited a limit of detection as low as 100 pg/mL, with robust discriminatory capacity between target antigens and nonspecific molecular interference, ensuring exceptional selectivity in detection. This result further confirms the exceptional performance of the metasurface biosensor in precise biomolecular detection, providing crucial technological support for achieving efficient and accurate early cancer screening.",creactiv protein crp biomark significantli elev cancer patient detect high sensit specif paramount import earli diagnosi screen cancer studi propos experiment demonstr crp antibodyfunction metasurfac biosensor simplifi metal design enabl highsensit detect crp use terahertz timedomain spectroscopi colloid gold nanoparticl enhanc sensit quantit detect capabl biosensor leverag local surfac plasmon reson lspr effect enhanc biomolecular recognit moreov addit high concentr crp antibodi improv antigen captur effici therebi boost sensor perform studi design biosensor use measur vari concentr crp two differ type antigen analyz sensor respons variat differ antigenbind condit specif crp recognit valid experiment result demonstr sensor exhibit limit detect low 100 pgml robust discriminatori capac target antigen nonspecif molecular interfer ensur except select detect result confirm except perform metasurfac biosensor precis biomolecular detect provid crucial technolog support achiev effici accur earli cancer screen
cancer,"We develop a theory to investigate Kerr nonlinearity in a hybrid nanosystem integrating a semiconductor quantum dot (SQD), a metallic nanoshell (MNS) consisting of a metallic inner core and a dielectric outer shell, and a cell membrane. Beyond the dipole approximation, an analytical expression for the Kerr coefficient is derived, with key findings as follows: (1) The multipole effect enables a significant enhancement of the Kerr coefficient compared to the dipole approximation scenario, whereas increasing the spacing between the SQD and the MNS leads to substantial suppression of this coefficient; (2) The Kerr spectrum can be switched from a two-peaked to a three-peaked structure solely by tuning the exciton-phonon coupling strength; (3) The heights, positions, and full widths at half maximum (FWHM) of the two sideband peaks in the Kerr spectrum exhibit high sensitivity to both pumping intensity and dielectric shell thickness. Importantly, we demonstrate the feasibility of detecting the initiation of normal cell carcinogenesis by monitoring the heights, locations, and frequency shifts of these two sideband peaks. The proposed scheme exhibits promising applications in quantum information networks and biosensing.",develop theori investig kerr nonlinear hybrid nanosystem integr semiconductor quantum dot sqd metal nanoshel mn consist metal inner core dielectr outer shell cell membran beyond dipol approxim analyt express kerr coeffici deriv key find follow 1 multipol effect enabl signific enhanc kerr coeffici compar dipol approxim scenario wherea increas space sqd mn lead substanti suppress coeffici 2 kerr spectrum switch twopeak threepeak structur sole tune excitonphonon coupl strength 3 height posit full width half maximum fwhm two sideband peak kerr spectrum exhibit high sensit pump intens dielectr shell thick importantli demonstr feasibl detect initi normal cell carcinogenesi monitor height locat frequenc shift two sideband peak propos scheme exhibit promis applic quantum inform network biosens
cancer,"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serves as a critical biomarker for the early diagnosis and monitoring of prostate malignancies. In this work, we report the fabrication of a carboxy-functionalized porous organic polymer (POP) as a highly sensitive and selective fluorescent immunosensor for PSA detection. The POP was synthesized via a solvothermal Schiff base condensation, which bears free -COOH functionalities to facilitate covalent antibody immobilization through classical EDC/NHS coupling chemistry. The resulting POP-antibody bioconjugate exhibited a pronounced fluorescence quenching response upon PSA binding, attributed to static quenching via ground-state complex formation, as confirmed by steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence studies. Under optimized conditions, the sensor achieved a limit of detection (LOD) of 14 pg/mL, demonstrating a wide linear dynamic range and minimal cross-reactivity with nontarget biomolecules. The high surface area and hierarchical porosity of the POP matrix contributed to enhanced probe-analyte interactions and signal amplification. Notably, the sensor retained excellent performance in complex matrices, with successful PSA quantification in artificial urine and blood samples, highlighting its potential for real-world clinical diagnostics. The synergistic integration of structural surface functionality and photostability in this POP-based platform underscores its promise for ultrasensitive, low-cost, and point-of-care biosensing of cancer biomarkers.",prostatespecif antigen psa serv critic biomark earli diagnosi monitor prostat malign work report fabric carboxyfunction porou organ polym pop highli sensit select fluoresc immunosensor psa detect pop synthes via solvotherm schiff base condens bear free cooh function facilit coval antibodi immobil classic edcnh coupl chemistri result popantibodi bioconjug exhibit pronounc fluoresc quench respons upon psa bind attribut static quench via groundstat complex format confirm steadyst timeresolv photoluminesc studi optim condit sensor achiev limit detect lod 14 pgml demonstr wide linear dynam rang minim crossreact nontarget biomolecul high surfac area hierarch poros pop matrix contribut enhanc probeanalyt interact signal amplif notabl sensor retain excel perform complex matric success psa quantif artifici urin blood sampl highlight potenti realworld clinic diagnost synergist integr structur surfac function photost popbas platform underscor promis ultrasensit lowcost pointofcar biosens cancer biomark
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have significantly improved outcomes for cancer patients. However, TKIs have a narrow therapeutic window, impact a high-risk population, and are frequently combined with additional medications, each of which increases the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). As polypharmacy becomes more common, especially in older and higher-risk groups that are prescribed TKIs, there is an increased risk for harmful DDIs. AREAS COVERED: TKI-related DDIs can lead to toxicity or reduced efficacy, which worsens patient outcomes and quality of life. In this review, we utilized the Drug Interaction Database (DIDB), FDA labels, and PubMed TKI DDI/ADME queries to focus on outlining the mechanisms underlying both pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) DDIs with TKIs. Pharmacokinetic DDIs involve changes in the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of a molecule (victim) caused by another drug (perpetrator). These DDIs may involve direct inhibition, post-translational modification, or transcriptional regulation. Pharmacodynamic DDIs involve overlapping mechanisms resulting in additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects when combining two medications. EXPERT OPINION: Understanding the mechanisms underlying DDIs facilitates a better grasp of TKI clinical pharmacology and will help in the development of strategies to optimize drug dosing and avoid DDIs.",introduct tyrosin kinas inhibitor tki significantli improv outcom cancer patient howev tki narrow therapeut window impact highrisk popul frequent combin addit medic increas risk drugdrug interact ddi polypharmaci becom common especi older higherrisk group prescrib tki increas risk harm ddi area cover tkirel ddi lead toxic reduc efficaci worsen patient outcom qualiti life review util drug interact databas didb fda label pubm tki ddiadm queri focu outlin mechan underli pharmacokinet pk pharmacodynam pd ddi tki pharmacokinet ddi involv chang absorpt distribut metabol excret adm molecul victim caus anoth drug perpetr ddi may involv direct inhibit posttransl modif transcript regul pharmacodynam ddi involv overlap mechan result addit synergist antagonist effect combin two medic expert opinion understand mechan underli ddi facilit better grasp tki clinic pharmacolog help develop strategi optim drug dose avoid ddi
cancer,"Lung adenocarcinoma is a prevalent form of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that accounts for approximately 40% of all lung cancers. However, despite significant therapeutic advances in recent years, the overall survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma remains poor. Consequently, it is necessary to identify further novel targets and drugs that can contribute to enhancing the prognosis of these patients. To this end, in this study, using siRNA silencing, we initially knocked down KPNA2 in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, and performed CCK8 and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assays to examine the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to determine whether the transcription factor FOXM1 can bind to the promoter region of KPNA2, and we used AlphaFold3 to predict the proteins that bind to KPNA2 and to characterize the binding sites on these proteins. We found that KPNA2 is upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma and that inhibiting its expression effectively reduced the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma cancer cells. Both bioinformatics analyses and experimental findings provided evidence that the expression of KPNA2 is directly controlled by FOXM1. Furthermore, we observed a reduction in FOXM1 expression following the suppression of KPNA2. These findings indicate the presence of a positive feedback loop between the expression of KPNA2 and FOXM1, which contributes to an enhanced proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma cells.",lung adenocarcinoma preval form nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc account approxim 40 lung cancer howev despit signific therapeut advanc recent year overal surviv patient lung adenocarcinoma remain poor consequ necessari identifi novel target drug contribut enhanc prognosi patient end studi use sirna silenc initi knock kpna2 lung adenocarcinoma cell line perform cck8 5ethynyl2deoxyuridin assay examin prolifer lung adenocarcinoma chromatin immunoprecipit use determin whether transcript factor foxm1 bind promot region kpna2 use alphafold3 predict protein bind kpna2 character bind site protein found kpna2 upregul lung adenocarcinoma inhibit express effect reduc prolifer lung adenocarcinoma cancer cell bioinformat analys experiment find provid evid express kpna2 directli control foxm1 furthermor observ reduct foxm1 express follow suppress kpna2 find indic presenc posit feedback loop express kpna2 foxm1 contribut enhanc prolifer lung adenocarcinoma cell
cancer,"Prostate cancer (PC) progression is predominantly driven by androgen signaling, making androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) the standard treatment. However, the transition to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) significantly reduces ADT efficacy. While taxanes such as docetaxel (Dtx) and cabazitaxel (Cbz) are widely employed, therapeutic resistance remains a major clinical obstacle. To address this, we established docetaxel-resistant CRPC models and performed an epigenetic drug screen, identifying MLL-Menin and MLL-WDR5 inhibitors as potent agents capable of restoring taxane sensitivity through G(2)/M arrest and apoptosis induction. Functional depletion of Menin (MEN1) revealed its critical role in sustaining chemoresistance, selectively impairing proliferation in resistant cells, and preventing resistance emergence in parental lines.Integrative transcriptomic (RNA-seq) and epigenomic (CUT&RUN-seq) analyses suggested that Menin may play a regulatory role in mTOR signaling and E2F target pathways. Menin binding to the promoters of mTOR and Cyclin D1 was confirmed, and rescue experiments further validated its regulatory role. Analysis of TCGA datasets demonstrated co-expression of MEN1 and mTOR in advanced metastatic PC, supporting clinical relevance. Moreover, combination treatment with the mTOR inhibitor Torin-1 and docetaxel synergistically enhanced therapeutic response in Menin-depleted resistant cells. MEN1 knockdown also abrogated tumor growth in vivo.These findings identify Menin as one of the key mediator of taxane resistance in CRPC through the regulation of mTOR. Targeting Menin, alone or in combination with mTOR inhibition, represents a promising strategy to overcome resistance and improve therapeutic outcomes in taxane-refractory PC.",prostat cancer pc progress predominantli driven androgen signal make androgen depriv therapi adt standard treatment howev transit castrationresist prostat cancer crpc significantli reduc adt efficaci taxan docetaxel dtx cabazitaxel cbz wide employ therapeut resist remain major clinic obstacl address establish docetaxelresist crpc model perform epigenet drug screen identifi mllmenin mllwdr5 inhibitor potent agent capabl restor taxan sensit g2m arrest apoptosi induct function deplet menin men1 reveal critic role sustain chemoresist select impair prolifer resist cell prevent resist emerg parent linesintegr transcriptom rnaseq epigenom cutrunseq analys suggest menin may play regulatori role mtor signal e2f target pathway menin bind promot mtor cyclin d1 confirm rescu experi valid regulatori role analysi tcga dataset demonstr coexpress men1 mtor advanc metastat pc support clinic relev moreov combin treatment mtor inhibitor torin1 docetaxel synergist enhanc therapeut respons menindeplet resist cell men1 knockdown also abrog tumor growth vivothes find identifi menin one key mediat taxan resist crpc regul mtor target menin alon combin mtor inhibit repres promis strategi overcom resist improv therapeut outcom taxanerefractori pc
cancer,"Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, necessitating innovative therapeutic strategies that enhance treatment efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Ratiometric codelivery has gained attention as a promising approach to improve the effectiveness of cancer chemotherapy to address the limitations of conventional monotherapies and random drug combinations. By enabling the simultaneous delivery of multiple anticancer drugs in fixed, synergistic ratios, this strategy helps achieve synergistic effects, reduces systemic toxicity, and combats multidrug resistance. The review outlines the scientific rationale behind this approach and the importance of maintaining optimal drug ratios for effective cancer treatment. The emphasis is placed on nanocarrier platforms, such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles, that enable the simultaneous and targeted release of drugs at optimized ratios. The article also examines the synergistic and combinatorial delivery, release kinetics, and in vitro and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of these systems in enhancing treatment outcomes across various cancer types. Furthermore, the technical challenges, clinical studies, and commercial landscape are also highlighted. This review concludes by outlining future directions and the need for translational research to bring ratiometric codelivery systems from bench to bedside.",cancer remain one lead caus mortal worldwid necessit innov therapeut strategi enhanc treatment efficaci minim toxic ratiometr codeliveri gain attent promis approach improv effect cancer chemotherapi address limit convent monotherapi random drug combin enabl simultan deliveri multipl anticanc drug fix synergist ratio strategi help achiev synergist effect reduc system toxic combat multidrug resist review outlin scientif rational behind approach import maintain optim drug ratio effect cancer treatment emphasi place nanocarri platform liposom polymer nanoparticl dendrim lipidpolym hybrid nanoparticl enabl simultan target releas drug optim ratio articl also examin synergist combinatori deliveri releas kinet vitro vivo therapeut efficaci system enhanc treatment outcom across variou cancer type furthermor technic challeng clinic studi commerci landscap also highlight review conclud outlin futur direct need translat research bring ratiometr codeliveri system bench bedsid
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: It is crucial to identify effective molecular markers for early endometrial cancer (EC) detection and therapeutic targets for late-stage EC. However, the role of E26 transformation-specific homologous factor (EHF) in EC remains poorly characterized. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Public databases were utilized to investigate the molecular features of EHF and its significance in the pathogenesis of EC. Analyses including single - gene correlation, functional enrichment, and immune infiltration were conducted. We used lentiviral-mediated EHF silencing in HEC-1B cells to examine EHF's impact on cell cycle, immigration, invasion, and proliferation. RESULTS: High EHF expression was linked to a more dismal prognosis of EC. The degree of tumor invasion, histologic type and stage, and clinical stage were significantly associated with EHF overexpression. Functional enrichment research conclusively indicated that EHF was closely linked to various activities, including the cell cycle, metabolic pathways, and interleukin 17 signaling pathway. The expression of EHF exhibited a negative connection with the presence of dendritic cells, natural killer (NK) cells, CD4 + type 1 T-helper cells, and the varying infiltration levels of other immune cells. In vitro study revealed increased EHF levels in endothelial cell tissues and cell lines. Analyses of functional components showed that EHF greatly enhances EC cell migration and development. CONCLUSION: Elevated EHF expression in EC patients correlated with diminished immune cell infiltration and a worse outcome. Decreasing EHF levels also affected the invasion and proliferation of EC cells. These findings highlight EHF as a putative prognostic and diagnostic biomarker for EC.",introduct crucial identifi effect molecular marker earli endometri cancer ec detect therapeut target latestag ec howev role e26 transformationspecif homolog factor ehf ec remain poorli character materi method public databas util investig molecular featur ehf signific pathogenesi ec analys includ singl gene correl function enrich immun infiltr conduct use lentiviralmedi ehf silenc hec1b cell examin ehf impact cell cycl immigr invas prolifer result high ehf express link dismal prognosi ec degre tumor invas histolog type stage clinic stage significantli associ ehf overexpress function enrich research conclus indic ehf close link variou activ includ cell cycl metabol pathway interleukin 17 signal pathway express ehf exhibit neg connect presenc dendrit cell natur killer nk cell cd4 type 1 thelper cell vari infiltr level immun cell vitro studi reveal increas ehf level endotheli cell tissu cell line analys function compon show ehf greatli enhanc ec cell migrat develop conclus elev ehf express ec patient correl diminish immun cell infiltr wors outcom decreas ehf level also affect invas prolifer ec cell find highlight ehf put prognost diagnost biomark ec
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Ovarian cancer significantly contributes to cancer-related deaths among women. Resistance to anchorage-dependent cell death (anoikis) plays a vital role in facilitating metastasis and worsening patient prognosis. Recent developments in the field of cancer biology have underscored the importance of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as crucial regulatory entities. However, their functions in the context of anoikis, particularly in ovarian cancer patients, remain inadequately understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of transcriptome data obtained from public databases, with a focus on screening lncRNAs associated with anoikis-related genes. A novel prognostic model that integrates risk scores to evaluate the predictive efficacy for patient outcomes was developed. We subsequently assessed the expression levels and functional role of the lncRNA BMPR1B-DT in ovarian cancer tissues through various techniques, including Western blot analysis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT‒PCR), cell counting kit-8 (CCK‒8) assays, and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Our research demonstrates that the anoikis-related lncRNA prognostic model has significant clinical value in predicting the survival outcomes of ovarian cancer patients. Additionally, our study revealed that expression of the lncRNA BMPR1B-DT is upregulated in ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. Moreover, we revealed that BMPR1B-DT promotes anoikis and inhibits proliferation under suspension culture conditions in ovarian cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that BMPR1B-DT expression is critical in the process of anoikis in ovarian cancer patients. These insights underscore the necessity for further investigations aimed at translating these findings into clinical applications to improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for ovarian cancer patients.",introduct ovarian cancer significantli contribut cancerrel death among women resist anchoragedepend cell death anoiki play vital role facilit metastasi worsen patient prognosi recent develop field cancer biolog underscor import long noncod rna lncrna crucial regulatori entiti howev function context anoiki particularli ovarian cancer patient remain inadequ understood materi method conduct comprehens analysi transcriptom data obtain public databas focu screen lncrna associ anoikisrel gene novel prognost model integr risk score evalu predict efficaci patient outcom develop subsequ assess express level function role lncrna bmpr1bdt ovarian cancer tissu variou techniqu includ western blot analysi quantit realtim polymeras chain reaction qrt‒pcr cell count kit8 cck‒8 assay flow cytometri result research demonstr anoikisrel lncrna prognost model signific clinic valu predict surviv outcom ovarian cancer patient addit studi reveal express lncrna bmpr1bdt upregul ovarian cancer tissu cell line moreov reveal bmpr1bdt promot anoiki inhibit prolifer suspens cultur condit ovarian cancer cell conclus result suggest bmpr1bdt express critic process anoiki ovarian cancer patient insight underscor necess investig aim translat find clinic applic improv diagnost therapeut approach ovarian cancer patient
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Current evidence suggests that both higher dietary quality and consumption of an anti-inflammatory diet are associated with lower mortality risk. However, the potential interaction between dietary quality and dietary inflammation in relation to mortality risk remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the dose-response relationship between dietary quality and mortality across different levels of dietary inflammation, and their joint associations among cancer survivors. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort analysis among 2,746 cancer survivors in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Dietary quality and inflammation were assessed by Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2020 and Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) scores. Mortality outcomes were determined using National Death Index records as of December 31, 2019. Primary outcomes included all-cause, cancer, non-cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Associations were examined using restricted cubic splines (RCS), stratified and joint analyses in Cox regressions. RESULTS: During a median 79 months of follow-up, 228 cancer and 435 non-cancer deaths were recorded, with CVD being the leading cause among non-cancer deaths. In the pro-inflammatory diet group, higher dietary quality was associated with lower risks of all-cause, cancer, and non-cancer mortality. Nonlinear associations were observed for all-cause and non-cancer mortality (p for nonlinearity < 0.05). Stratified analysis showed that in the pro-inflammatory diet group, higher HEI scores were associated with lower risks of all-cause (HR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.42-0.73), cancer (HR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.33-0.99), and non-cancer mortality (HR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.37-0.80). Joint analyses indicated that cancer survivors with both a high HEI diet and anti-inflammatory diet had the lowest risks of all-cause, cancer, and non-cancer mortality. The above correlations remained significant after excluding participants who died within 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Among cancer survivors consuming a pro-inflammatory diet, higher dietary quality was significantly associated with lower mortality risk. Nonlinear dose-response relationships were observed for all-cause and non-cancer mortality. Moreover, the combination of a high HEI diet and anti-inflammatory diet was associated with the lowest mortality risk.",background current evid suggest higher dietari qualiti consumpt antiinflammatori diet associ lower mortal risk howev potenti interact dietari qualiti dietari inflamm relat mortal risk remain unclear therefor studi aim examin doserespons relationship dietari qualiti mortal across differ level dietari inflamm joint associ among cancer survivor method conduct prospect cohort analysi among 2746 cancer survivor nation health nutrit examin survey nhane dietari qualiti inflamm assess healthi eat index hei2020 dietari inflammatori index dii score mortal outcom determin use nation death index record decemb 31 2019 primari outcom includ allcaus cancer noncanc cardiovascular diseas cvd mortal associ examin use restrict cubic spline rc stratifi joint analys cox regress result median 79 month followup 228 cancer 435 noncanc death record cvd lead caus among noncanc death proinflammatori diet group higher dietari qualiti associ lower risk allcaus cancer noncanc mortal nonlinear associ observ allcaus noncanc mortal p nonlinear 005 stratifi analysi show proinflammatori diet group higher hei score associ lower risk allcaus hr 056 95 ci 042073 cancer hr 058 95 ci 033099 noncanc mortal hr 054 95 ci 037080 joint analys indic cancer survivor high hei diet antiinflammatori diet lowest risk allcaus cancer noncanc mortal correl remain signific exclud particip die within 24 month conclus among cancer survivor consum proinflammatori diet higher dietari qualiti significantli associ lower mortal risk nonlinear doserespons relationship observ allcaus noncanc mortal moreov combin high hei diet antiinflammatori diet associ lowest mortal risk
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Identifying significantly mutated genes in tumors aids in understanding disease etiology and survival and may aid in the discovery of new drug targets. We aimed to detect and characterize mutated genes from a large, well-characterized group of colorectal cancers. METHODS: In tumor and paired normal samples from 6,111 colorectal patients, we sequenced 199 genes identified from whole exome sequencing of over 1,100 tumors. Analyses focused on non-silent mutations. We classified significantly mutated genes after stratification by hypermutation status, and estimated associations of mutated genes/pathways with disease-specific (DS)-survival using Cox regression, adjusting for age, sex, mutation burden, hypermutation status, and study while accounting for multiple comparisons (n = 4,874). RESULTS: We identified 57 genes that were significantly mutated in colorectal cancer, including 9 that were not previously reported. Among individual genes, only BRAF p.V600E mutations were significantly associated with poorer survival after correction for multiple testing (HR 1.96, P = 2.07 x 10(- 10)), with a more pronounced association among those with non-hypermutated tumors (HR 2.24, P = 1.79 x 10(- 12)). We also observed statistically significant associations with survival for four mutated pathways: TP53/ATM (HR 1.24, P = 7.96 x 10(- 4)), RTK/RAS (HR 1.33, P = 3.81 x 10(- 6)), TGF-beta (HR 1.25, P = 1.85 x 10(- 3)), and WNT (HR 0.81, P = 2.52 x 10(- 03)). CONCLUSIONS: We identified 9 significantly mutated genes, some of which are known drug targets. Among individual genes, only the BRAF p.V600E mutation was significantly associated with DS-survival, suggesting a limited survival impact from mutations driving colorectal cancer development.",background identifi significantli mutat gene tumor aid understand diseas etiolog surviv may aid discoveri new drug target aim detect character mutat gene larg wellcharacter group colorect cancer method tumor pair normal sampl 6111 colorect patient sequenc 199 gene identifi whole exom sequenc 1100 tumor analys focus nonsil mutat classifi significantli mutat gene stratif hypermut statu estim associ mutat genespathway diseasespecif dssurviv use cox regress adjust age sex mutat burden hypermut statu studi account multipl comparison n 4874 result identifi 57 gene significantli mutat colorect cancer includ 9 previous report among individu gene braf pv600e mutat significantli associ poorer surviv correct multipl test hr 196 p 207 x 10 10 pronounc associ among nonhypermut tumor hr 224 p 179 x 10 12 also observ statist signific associ surviv four mutat pathway tp53atm hr 124 p 796 x 10 4 rtkra hr 133 p 381 x 10 6 tgfbeta hr 125 p 185 x 10 3 wnt hr 081 p 252 x 10 03 conclus identifi 9 significantli mutat gene known drug target among individu gene braf pv600e mutat significantli associ dssurviv suggest limit surviv impact mutat drive colorect cancer develop
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and safety of suprapubic incision antegrade endoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy with preservation of the great saphenous vein and its branches in penile cancer treatment. METHODS: Between February 2023 and July 2024, penile cancer patients undergoing suprapubic incision endoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy with great saphenous vein and branch preservation were recruited from the Urology Departments of Huai'an First Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University and Xuzhou Cancer Hospital. Fifteen patients (mean age: 67.4 +/- 8.85 years) were included, all having undergone partial penectomy. Postoperative pathology confirmed tumor stages >/= T1b, and no distant metastasis was observed. In the supine position, a subcutaneous space was created under direct vision, followed by establishment of endoscopic working channels. Dissection encompassed superficial and deep inguinal lymph nodes while preserving the great saphenous vein trunk and branches. Anatomical boundaries were defined as: upper border-line between external ring upper edge and anterior superior iliac spine; outer border-line from anterior superior iliac spine to 20 cm inferior; inner border-medial thigh from pubic tubercle to 15 cm inferior; lower border-line connecting lower edges of inner and outer boundaries. RESULTS: All patients underwent successful bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy. Mean operation duration was 96 +/- 18.8 min, with mean blood loss of 41.3 +/- 16.2 ml. Average lymph node yields were 7.3 +/- 3.9 (left) and 9.5 +/- 4.4 (right). Drainage tubes were indwelling for 7.7 +/- 2.0 days, with total drainage volume of 274.7 +/- 126.4 ml, and mean hospital stay was 8.7 +/- 1.8 days. All wounds achieved grade A healing. Postoperative complications included 1 lymphocele and 1 lymphorrhea, both resolved with symptomatic management. During 9-25 months of follow-up, no cases of wound infection, subcutaneous hematoma, lower limb edema, skin necrosis, or local/distant metastasis were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Suprapubic incision antegrade endoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy with great saphenous vein and branch preservation exhibits definite therapeutic efficacy and minimal complications, justifying cautious clinical implementation.",object assess feasibl safeti suprapub incis antegrad endoscop inguin lymphadenectomi preserv great saphen vein branch penil cancer treatment method februari 2023 juli 2024 penil cancer patient undergo suprapub incis endoscop inguin lymphadenectomi great saphen vein branch preserv recruit urolog depart huaian first hospit affili nanj medic univers xuzhou cancer hospit fifteen patient mean age 674 885 year includ undergon partial penectomi postop patholog confirm tumor stage t1b distant metastasi observ supin posit subcutan space creat direct vision follow establish endoscop work channel dissect encompass superfici deep inguin lymph node preserv great saphen vein trunk branch anatom boundari defin upper borderlin extern ring upper edg anterior superior iliac spine outer borderlin anterior superior iliac spine 20 cm inferior inner bordermedi thigh pubic tubercl 15 cm inferior lower borderlin connect lower edg inner outer boundari result patient underw success bilater inguin lymphadenectomi mean oper durat 96 188 min mean blood loss 413 162 ml averag lymph node yield 73 39 left 95 44 right drainag tube indwel 77 20 day total drainag volum 2747 1264 ml mean hospit stay 87 18 day wound achiev grade heal postop complic includ 1 lymphocel 1 lymphorrhea resolv symptomat manag 925 month followup case wound infect subcutan hematoma lower limb edema skin necrosi localdist metastasi observ conclus suprapub incis antegrad endoscop inguin lymphadenectomi great saphen vein branch preserv exhibit definit therapeut efficaci minim complic justifi cautiou clinic implement
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer, often caused by persistent high-risk HPV infection, remains a significant public health challenge with limited treatment options. Chemokines play crucial roles in immune cell recruitment and tumor microenvironment modulation. This study proposes a chemokine-based predictive model to optimize personalized treatment and prognosis. METHODS: Bulk RNA-seq and clinical data from TCGA-CESC and GSE52903 cohorts were analyzed along with 152 chemokine-related genes (CRGs). Prognostic CRGs were identified via Cox regression, consensus clustering was used for subtypes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed with ""limma"". Then, a RiskScore model was developed through Lasso algorithm, and ROC curves were performed for the model performance. CIBERSORT, TIMER, MCP-counter and TIDE were used for the immune differences. Drug sensitivity was analyzed via IMvigor210 cohort and the ""oncoPredict"" package. GSEA identified enriched pathways, and single-cell RNA-seq (GSE168652) explored the special cell types in tumor and normal tissues. Finally, we examined the model gene expression by qPCR, and cell proliferation, migration and invasion through CCK-8, wound healing and trans-well assay. RESULTS: Through the analysis of the TCGA-CESC and GSE52903 cohorts, we first identified 39 prognostic CRGs and subsequently stratified cervical cancer patients into two molecular subtypes (C1/C2) based on their expression profiles. These subtypes exhibited significant differences in overall survival (C1 with a more favorable prognosis than C2) and distinct immune infiltration patterns. We then developed and validated a robust risk score model based on subtype-specific differentially expressed genes, which incorporated six genes (CXCL8, ITGA5, BACE2, CCR7, CERS4, and MEI1). Furthermore, the risk score revealed profound heterogeneity in the tumor immune microenvironment: the low-risk group was characterized by enhanced infiltration of immune cells (e.g., CD8 + T cells, activated CD4 + T cells, and M1 macrophages) and a higher predicted response to immunotherapy, whereas the high-risk group was associated with an immunosuppressive phenotype and T cell dysfunction. Mechanistically, the high-risk signature was linked to the activation of pro-tumorigenic pathways, including focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, and the IL-17 signaling pathway. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis further pinpointed the cellular origins of key model genes, revealing that CXCL8 was predominantly highly expressed in tumor-associated monocytes/macrophages. Finally, in vitro functional assays confirmed that CXCL8 was significantly upregulated in cervical cancer cells, and its knockdown potently suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a distinct chemokine-driven molecular classification and constructed a chemokine-related prognostic model for cervical cancer. These findings offer novel insights into tumor immunobiology and provide a promising tool for improving individualized risk stratification and therapeutic strategies for cervical cancer.",background cervic cancer often caus persist highrisk hpv infect remain signific public health challeng limit treatment option chemokin play crucial role immun cell recruit tumor microenviron modul studi propos chemokinebas predict model optim person treatment prognosi method bulk rnaseq clinic data tcgacesc gse52903 cohort analyz along 152 chemokinerel gene crg prognost crg identifi via cox regress consensu cluster use subtyp differenti express gene deg analyz limma riskscor model develop lasso algorithm roc curv perform model perform cibersort timer mcpcounter tide use immun differ drug sensit analyz via imvigor210 cohort oncopredict packag gsea identifi enrich pathway singlecel rnaseq gse168652 explor special cell type tumor normal tissu final examin model gene express qpcr cell prolifer migrat invas cck8 wound heal transwel assay result analysi tcgacesc gse52903 cohort first identifi 39 prognost crg subsequ stratifi cervic cancer patient two molecular subtyp c1c2 base express profil subtyp exhibit signific differ overal surviv c1 favor prognosi c2 distinct immun infiltr pattern develop valid robust risk score model base subtypespecif differenti express gene incorpor six gene cxcl8 itga5 bace2 ccr7 cers4 mei1 furthermor risk score reveal profound heterogen tumor immun microenviron lowrisk group character enhanc infiltr immun cell eg cd8 cell activ cd4 cell m1 macrophag higher predict respons immunotherapi wherea highrisk group associ immunosuppress phenotyp cell dysfunct mechanist highrisk signatur link activ protumorigen pathway includ focal adhes ecmreceptor interact il17 signal pathway singlecel transcriptom analysi pinpoint cellular origin key model gene reveal cxcl8 predominantli highli express tumorassoci monocytesmacrophag final vitro function assay confirm cxcl8 significantli upregul cervic cancer cell knockdown potent suppress cell prolifer migrat invas conclus studi identifi distinct chemokinedriven molecular classif construct chemokinerel prognost model cervic cancer find offer novel insight tumor immunobiolog provid promis tool improv individu risk stratif therapeut strategi cervic cancer
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of adding of a pyloroplasty procedure during the performance of minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) or robotically assisted MIE (RAMIE), we conducted a prospective, phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT)(NCT03740542). BACKGROUND: Many surgeons include pyloroplasty when performing esophagectomy, but few studies have provided level 1 evidence to support or refute this step especially in the era of MIE and RAMIE. METHODS: An adaptive randomization trial design was utilized to maximize patients treated on more effective therapy and conversely minimize accrual to a less effective procedure. The trial was designed to proceed until one arm was established as superior or until a total of 140 patients had been treated and deemed evaluable for response. The primary endpoints of the study were pneumonia and/or anastomotic leak requiring surgery within 30 days of surgery. RESULTS: Over a 4-year period, 143 patients were randomized, and 134 patients were evaluable. The greater likelihood of success for pyloroplasty throughout the trial resulted in more patients randomized towards pyloroplasty (n= 90) vs. no pyloroplasty (n=44). Pneumonia or an anastomotic leak occurred in 16 of 90 (18%) patients in the pyloroplasty arm vs. 12 of 44 (27%) in the no-pyloroplasty arm. The stopping criteria were met when the posterior probability of pyloroplasty being superior reached 90%. CONCLUSIONS: The design of this trial led to early stopping because the short-term results indicated that outcomes in the pyloroplasty arm were superior to the no-pyloroplasty arm. This RCT provides evidence for short-term benefits of adding pyloroplasty to MIE or RAMIE. The long-term outcomes and quality of life measures continue to be monitored.",object assess valu ad pyloroplasti procedur perform minim invas esophagectomi mie robot assist mie rami conduct prospect phase iii random control trial rctnct03740542 background mani surgeon includ pyloroplasti perform esophagectomi studi provid level 1 evid support refut step especi era mie rami method adapt random trial design util maxim patient treat effect therapi convers minim accrual less effect procedur trial design proceed one arm establish superior total 140 patient treat deem evalu respons primari endpoint studi pneumonia andor anastomot leak requir surgeri within 30 day surgeri result 4year period 143 patient random 134 patient evalu greater likelihood success pyloroplasti throughout trial result patient random toward pyloroplasti n 90 vs pyloroplasti n44 pneumonia anastomot leak occur 16 90 18 patient pyloroplasti arm vs 12 44 27 nopyloroplasti arm stop criteria met posterior probabl pyloroplasti superior reach 90 conclus design trial led earli stop shortterm result indic outcom pyloroplasti arm superior nopyloroplasti arm rct provid evid shortterm benefit ad pyloroplasti mie rami longterm outcom qualiti life measur continu monitor
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations of homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene mutations with clinical prognosis in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients with various histological subtypes. METHODS: The EOC patients treated at our institute from January 2014 to March 2021 were included. Gene mutations were detected using 24 target HRR genes. The associations between HRR gene mutations and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 318 patients were evaluated, 37 patients had BRCA, and 21 patients had other HRR gene mutations. EOC patients with HRR gene mutations were associated with platinum sensitivity than wild type (82.8% vs. 68.7%, p=0.033), and it remained significant in patients with advanced stage (79.5% vs. 57.6%, p=0.007), serous carcinoma (89.4% vs. 66.2%, p=0.002) or optimal debulking surgery (97.1% vs. 79.1%, p=0.013). In serous carcinoma, advanced stage (hazard ratio [HR]=2.11; p=0.031), HRR mutation (HR=0.62; p=0.021) and 1st line poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi, HR=0.28; p<0.001) were significant for cancer recurrence. Suboptimal debulking surgery (HR=1.58; p=0.044) and HRR gene mutation (HR=0.33; p=0.001) were important for cancer-related death. In non-serous carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma (HR=3.91; p=0.023), advanced stage (HR=3.10; p<0.001) and suboptimal debulking surgery (HR=2.63; p=0.001) were significant for cancer recurrence. Mucinous carcinoma (HR=9.17; p=0.001), advanced stage (HR=4.26; p<0.001), and suboptimal debulking surgery (HR=3.80; p<0.001) were important for cancer-related death. CONCLUSION: HRR gene mutations were associated with platinum sensitivity, PARPi response and favorable survival in serous EOC patients. In non-serous EOC, HRR gene mutations did not show the same trend, which warrants further investigation.",object investig associ homolog recombin repair hrr gene mutat clinic prognosi epitheli ovarian cancer eoc patient variou histolog subtyp method eoc patient treat institut januari 2014 march 2021 includ gene mutat detect use 24 target hrr gene associ hrr gene mutat clinic outcom analyz result total 318 patient evalu 37 patient brca 21 patient hrr gene mutat eoc patient hrr gene mutat associ platinum sensit wild type 828 vs 687 p0033 remain signific patient advanc stage 795 vs 576 p0007 serou carcinoma 894 vs 662 p0002 optim debulk surgeri 971 vs 791 p0013 serou carcinoma advanc stage hazard ratio hr211 p0031 hrr mutat hr062 p0021 1st line polyadpribos polymeras inhibitor parpi hr028 p0001 signific cancer recurr suboptim debulk surgeri hr158 p0044 hrr gene mutat hr033 p0001 import cancerrel death nonser carcinoma mucin carcinoma hr391 p0023 advanc stage hr310 p0001 suboptim debulk surgeri hr263 p0001 signific cancer recurr mucin carcinoma hr917 p0001 advanc stage hr426 p0001 suboptim debulk surgeri hr380 p0001 import cancerrel death conclus hrr gene mutat associ platinum sensit parpi respons favor surviv serou eoc patient nonser eoc hrr gene mutat show trend warrant investig
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Combining cisplatin and gemcitabine (CG) in the concurrent and adjuvant treatment phase of advanced cervical cancer has improved oncological outcome at the cost of excess toxicity. We aimed to investigate the feasibility and safety of this treatment intensification in the era of modern radiotherapy. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on patients treated with definitive chemoradiation including CG for advanced cervical cancer. Treatment consisted of chemoradiotherapy (weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m(2) and gemcitabine 125 mg/m(2) with volumetric-modulated arc therapy) followed by image-guided adaptive brachytherapy and 2 cycles of adjuvant CG. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were included with a median follow-up of 48 months (range, 7-130). Patients with FIGO stage IIIC1 accounted for 49.1% of cases, with an additional 23.6% being stage IIIC2. The median number of concurrent gemcitabine and cisplatin administrations was 4 (range, 1-6), and 5 (range, 2-8), respectively. Forty-four patients (80%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. Hematological severe short-term toxicity (grade >/=3) occurred in 22 patients (43.1%). There was no deviation from planned radiotherapy-schedule. No treatment-related death occurred. Five patients experienced late grade >/=3 adverse events. Local, locoregional and distant control rates at 5 years were 82.0%, 70.5% and 69.3%, respectively.

cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Early-stage uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS) remains a clinical challenge due to high recurrence and mortality rates. As most early-stage cases are diagnosed at stage IB, this study aims to investigate the prognostic factors and optimal management for stage IB uLMS. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of medical records for patients who underwent surgical intervention and were diagnosed with stage IB uLMS at the Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center from January 1, 2006, to August 31, 2023. RESULTS: After a median follow-up time of 70.1 months (range: 2.3-234.1), we observed a median disease-free survival (DFS) of 18 months and overall survival (OS) of 67.9 months, respectively. Median DFS was 14.7 months in the observation group and 18.4 months in the adjuvant chemotherapy group. Median OS was 75.4 months in the observation group and 66.6 months in the adjuvant chemotherapy group. Five-year DFS rates were 14.1% and 15.7%, and OS rates were 66.5% and 54.1% for the observation and chemotherapy groups, respectively. Poor DFS was associated with age >48 years, postmenopausal status, tumor size >12 cm, elevated Ki-67 levels, and lymphadenectomy, but these factors did not correlate with OS outcomes. No significant DFS or OS differences were found between chemotherapy and observation groups or across chemotherapy regimens. Ovarian preservation did not affect prognosis. CONCLUSION: Age >48 years, postmenopausal status, larger tumor size, higher Ki-67, and lymphadenectomy predicted poor DFS but not OS in stage IB uLMS. Ovarian preservation is safe.

cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancers are the 3 main cancers of the female reproductive system. Analyzing data from the cancer registry database will help understand the situation and trends of these diseases. METHODS: This study utilized data from Thailand's population-based cancer registries covering 16 provinces across 5 geographic regions between 2019 and 2021. Data collection included demographic characteristics, cancer incidence, histopathology, disease stage, and survival outcomes. Incidence rates were calculated using age-standardized rates (ASRs) per 100,000 population, and 5-year survival outcomes were compared across 2 time periods (2013-2017 vs. 2018-2022). RESULTS: During 2019-2021, Thailand recorded a mean annual ASR of 132.9 for females, with cervical cancer remaining the most common gynecologic cancer. The incidence of cervical cancer decreased from 19.5 per 100,000 in 1995-2000 to 10.3 per 100,000 in 2019-2021. Uterine cancer demonstrated a rising trend, from 3.6 per 100,000 in 2004-2006 to 6.1 per 100,000 in 2019-2021, while ovarian cancer incidence remained relatively stable at 5.9 per 100,000. Five-year survival rates improved significantly across all gynecologic cancers in 2018-2022 compared with 2013-2017. The hazard ratios for overall survival by stage ranged from 0.57 to 0.81 for cervical, 0.53 to 0.82 for uterine, and 0.57 to 0.81 for ovarian cancers (all p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The incidence of cervical cancer in Thailand has declined over the past 2 decades, while the burdens of uterine and ovarian cancers are increasing.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: Rhomboid intercostal and sub-serratus plane (RISS) block is a novel nerve block technique that provides good analgesia, but overall research is scarce. This study aimed to investigate the effect of ultrasound-guided RISS block on postoperative analgesia and diaphragmatic excursion (DE) after video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for lung cancer. METHODS: One hundred patients who underwent VATS lung resection participated in this study and were randomized to a RISS group (Group R) or a control group (Group C). Group R underwent ultrasound-guided RISS block with 0.25% ropivacaine hydrochloride 0.5 ml/kg immediately after surgery. Group C was given standard general anaesthesia, and patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) was used in the postoperative period in both groups. The visual analogue scores (VAS) at rest and during movement at 2 hours(h), 24 h, and 48 h postoperatively were used as the primary outcome measures. Secondary outcomes included postoperative consumption of sufentanil; preoperative and postoperative left and right-sided DE during calm and deep breathing, and the occurrence of adverse effects such as postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), dizziness, somnolence, puncture site infection, and hematoma. RESULTS: At 2 h, 24 h, and 48 h postoperatively, patients in Group R had lower VAS scores at rest (median [Q1, Q3]: 1.00 [1.00, 1.00]; 1.00 [1.00, 1.00]; 0.00 [0.00, 1.00]) and during movement (2.00 [2.00, 3.00]; 2.00 [2.00, 2.00]; 2.00 [1.00, 2.00]) than those in Group C (resting: 2.00 [2.00, 2.00]; 2.00 [2.00, 2.00]; 1.00 [1.00, 2.00]; movement: 3.00 [3.00, 4.00]; 3.00 [3.00, 4.00]; 3.00 [2.00, 4.00]) (all P < 0.0001). Sufentanil consumption at 2 h, 24 h, and 48 h postoperatively was also significantly lower in Group R (P = 0.0002, P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001). Preoperatively, no significant difference in DE existed between the groups (P > 0.05). At 30 min post-extubation and 2 h and 24 h postoperatively, during both calm and deep breathing on both sides, Group R had significantly greater DE than Group C (P < 0.05). At 48 h postoperatively, the right-sided DE during calm breathing showed no significant difference between the groups. PONV incidences did not differ significantly (P = 0.2662), and Group R had less dizziness, somnolence, higher satisfaction post-surgery, and showed no cases of puncture site infection or hematoma. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-guided RISS block can modestly reduce postoperative pain in patients undergoing VATS, with clinically relevant benefits, and may help alleviate diaphragmatic dysfunction caused by surgical or anesthetic factors.

cancer,"Two series of alizarine derivatives containing vanillin scaffold (10a-h) or aromatic amide function (12a-h) were synthesized and structurally characterized. The cytotoxic evaluation revealed higher activity towards leukemia cancer cell lines (K562 and HL-60) than solid tumor cells (HeLa and MCF-7). The compound 10 h, containing a benzyl group, showed the most prominent activity against K562 cells, and the lowest toxicity towards healthy cells among all active derivatives. The most active compounds 10f, 10 h, and 12 h were further investigated and induced a significant increase in the percentage of HeLa, K562, and HL-60 cells in the subG1 cell cycle phase in comparison with the control cells. Compounds 10f and 10 h activated apoptosis in K562 cells through all three tested caspases, while derivative 12 h only induced the activation of the main effector caspase-3. Molecular docking simulations suggest that these compounds can form stable complexes with caspase-3, consistent with their experimentally confirmed involvement in caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways. All three tested derivatives demonstrated moderate to strong binding to bovine serum albumin (BSA), with preferential occupation of subdomain IIA (site I), as supported both experimentally and through docking studies. The interaction study of these compounds with DNA indicated their ability to interact with ct-DNA through the minor groove.",two seri alizarin deriv contain vanillin scaffold 10ah aromat amid function 12ah synthes structur character cytotox evalu reveal higher activ toward leukemia cancer cell line k562 hl60 solid tumor cell hela mcf7 compound 10 h contain benzyl group show promin activ k562 cell lowest toxic toward healthi cell among activ deriv activ compound 10f 10 h 12 h investig induc signific increas percentag hela k562 hl60 cell subg1 cell cycl phase comparison control cell compound 10f 10 h activ apoptosi k562 cell three test caspas deriv 12 h induc activ main effector caspase3 molecular dock simul suggest compound form stabl complex caspase3 consist experiment confirm involv caspasedepend apoptot pathway three test deriv demonstr moder strong bind bovin serum albumin bsa preferenti occup subdomain iia site support experiment dock studi interact studi compound dna indic abil interact ctdna minor groov
cancer,"Lung cancer continues to be a major cause of deaths associated with cancer, with a considerable number of patients being diagnosed at more advanced stages of the disease. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs), which are stable in body fluids, offer promising avenues for non-invasive biomarker identification. Recent advancements have highlighted the utility of specific miRNA signatures in treatment decisions and prognostic evaluations. This review has explored the significant function of circulating miRNAs as promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for lung cancer. Integration of miRNA profiles with clinical parameters has shown potential in predicting treatment responses and patient outcomes. Nevertheless, obstacles persist in standardizing the protocols for isolating and quantifying miRNAs, along with the variability of miRNA expression across various cancer types and stages. Future research focusing on larger, multi-center studies is essential to validate the diagnostic and prognostic capacities of circulating miRNAs and enhance their applicability in clinical practice.",lung cancer continu major caus death associ cancer consider number patient diagnos advanc stage diseas circul microrna mirna stabl bodi fluid offer promis avenu noninvas biomark identif recent advanc highlight util specif mirna signatur treatment decis prognost evalu review explor signific function circul mirna promis diagnost prognost biomark lung cancer integr mirna profil clinic paramet shown potenti predict treatment respons patient outcom nevertheless obstacl persist standard protocol isol quantifi mirna along variabl mirna express across variou cancer type stage futur research focus larger multicent studi essenti valid diagnost prognost capac circul mirna enhanc applic clinic practic
cancer,"Polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) are crucial mediators of tumor-induced immunosuppression, while their heterogeneity and spatial dynamics across malignancies remain poorly understood. By integrating single-cell RNA sequencing data from 576 samples across 19 cancer types and spatial transcriptomics data from three distinct malignancies, we identified a PMN-MDSC population. This cell population demonstrated characteristic upregulation of immunosuppressive genes and was associated with poor prognosis across multiple cancer cohorts. Notably, TREM1 was highly expressed in PMN-MDSCs and may mediate immunosuppressive processes. Multiplex immunofluorescence demonstrated that TREM1(+) PMN-MDSCs exhibited significantly higher distribution in tumor regions compared to non-tumor tissues. Spatial transcriptomics analysis revealed their co-localization with fibroblasts and exhausted T cells. Moreover, CellChat analysis showed that TREM1(+) PMN-MDSCs remodeled the tumor microenvironment through interactions with diverse cellular components. Collectively, our study revealed the conserved immunosuppressive features and spatial interaction networks of TREM1(+) PMN-MDSCs from a pan-cancer perspective, highlighting TREM1 as a pivotal therapeutic target to disrupt PMN-MDSC-mediated tumor immune evasion.",polymorphonuclear myeloidderiv suppressor cell pmnmdsc crucial mediat tumorinduc immunosuppress heterogen spatial dynam across malign remain poorli understood integr singlecel rna sequenc data 576 sampl across 19 cancer type spatial transcriptom data three distinct malign identifi pmnmdsc popul cell popul demonstr characterist upregul immunosuppress gene associ poor prognosi across multipl cancer cohort notabl trem1 highli express pmnmdsc may mediat immunosuppress process multiplex immunofluoresc demonstr trem1 pmnmdsc exhibit significantli higher distribut tumor region compar nontumor tissu spatial transcriptom analysi reveal coloc fibroblast exhaust cell moreov cellchat analysi show trem1 pmnmdsc remodel tumor microenviron interact divers cellular compon collect studi reveal conserv immunosuppress featur spatial interact network trem1 pmnmdsc pancanc perspect highlight trem1 pivot therapeut target disrupt pmnmdscmediat tumor immun evas
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of MRI in detecting residual disease after conization in patients with early-stage cervical cancer (CC) and to evaluate the impact of MRI on FIGO staging and surgical management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2018 and December 2023, a consecutive series of patients with early-stage invasive CC undergoing conization, pre-operative pelvic MRI, and surgery were included in this retrospective study. Two experienced radiologists reviewed the MRI scans for the presence of residual tumor, assessed on T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and contrast-enhanced sequences, if available. MRI findings were compared with surgical pathology to evaluate diagnostic performance and clinical impact. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients were included in the study. MRI detected residual disease with an accuracy of 78.7% (95% CI 71.0-86.4), sensitivity of 66%, specificity of 90.9%, positive predictive value of 87.5%, and negative predictive value of 73.5%. The use of contrast agent showed no significant difference in overall accuracy, with an accuracy of 74.5% for contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) and 83% for non-CE-MRI (p = 0.28), respectively. MRI correctly staged 73.8% of cases, suggested the correct extent of radicality in 79.7% of cases following the 2018 ESGO guidelines, and the appropriate type of hysterectomy (simple vs. radical) in 90.9% of cases following the SHAPE study. CONCLUSION: Non-CE MRI is a reliable and sufficient tool for detecting residual tumor after conization in early-stage CC, as contrast administration offers no additional diagnostic value. Accurate pre-operative identification of residual disease may refine FIGO staging and assist in tailoring surgical strategies. KEY POINTS: Question MRI evaluation of residual tumor after cervical conization in early-stage cervical cancer is critical to optimize surgical planning noninvasively and avoid overtreatment. Findings MRI correctly identified residual disease with high specificity (90.9%) and moderate sensitivity (66%); contrast enhancement did not significantly improve diagnostic accuracy. Clinical relevance MRI, particularly non-contrast protocols, reliably excludes post-conization residual disease and aids in selecting appropriate surgical treatment, reducing overtreatment in early-stage cervical cancer.",object assess accuraci mri detect residu diseas coniz patient earlystag cervic cancer cc evalu impact mri figo stage surgic manag materi method januari 2018 decemb 2023 consecut seri patient earlystag invas cc undergo coniz preoper pelvic mri surgeri includ retrospect studi two experienc radiologist review mri scan presenc residu tumor assess t2weight diffusionweight contrastenhanc sequenc avail mri find compar surgic patholog evalu diagnost perform clinic impact result total 108 patient includ studi mri detect residu diseas accuraci 787 95 ci 710864 sensit 66 specif 909 posit predict valu 875 neg predict valu 735 use contrast agent show signific differ overal accuraci accuraci 745 contrastenhanc mri cemri 83 noncemri p 028 respect mri correctli stage 738 case suggest correct extent radic 797 case follow 2018 esgo guidelin appropri type hysterectomi simpl vs radic 909 case follow shape studi conclus nonc mri reliabl suffici tool detect residu tumor coniz earlystag cc contrast administr offer addit diagnost valu accur preoper identif residu diseas may refin figo stage assist tailor surgic strategi key point question mri evalu residu tumor cervic coniz earlystag cervic cancer critic optim surgic plan noninvas avoid overtreat find mri correctli identifi residu diseas high specif 909 moder sensit 66 contrast enhanc significantli improv diagnost accuraci clinic relev mri particularli noncontrast protocol reliabl exclud postcon residu diseas aid select appropri surgic treatment reduc overtreat earlystag cervic cancer
cancer,"BACKGROUND: People with colorectal cancer (CRC) in the postoperative period face a high prevalence of nutritional risk and malnutrition. Oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) is the guideline-recommended primary method of nutritional support for this population; however, its effectiveness is often undermined by low compliance among them. This study sought to investigate the needs and preferences of people with CRC in the postoperative period regarding ONS, offering a theoretical foundation for enhancing compliance from the perspective of participants' preferences. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted, involving semi-structured interviews with 14 people with CRC in the postoperative period at a tertiary hospital in Xiamen, China, from March to April 2025. Data analysis integrated unstructured observational data with details of the oral nutritional supplements and ONS regimens used by participants, and the research team employed thematic analysis to synthesize the findings. RESULTS: Two primary themes emerged, encompassing seven subthemes: (1) Demands and preferences for oral nutritional supplements: Participants valued portability, practicality, standardization, scientific validity, and clear labeling; they also sought improved cost-effectiveness or reimbursement via medical insurance, rapid and significant nutritional support effects, and a preference for disease-specific formulas. (2) Demands and preferences for ONS regimens: Participants emphasized credibility, alignment with personal habits and preferences, and the provision of education and guidance. CONCLUSION: People with CRC in the postoperative period reported suboptimal experiences with ONS, exhibited notable misconceptions about its use, and indicated that current regimens failed to address their treatment needs and preferences. Clinicians should adopt a person-centered approach, designing ONS regimens tailored to their preferences to improve acceptance and compliance.",background peopl colorect cancer crc postop period face high preval nutrit risk malnutrit oral nutrit supplement on guidelinerecommend primari method nutrit support popul howev effect often undermin low complianc among studi sought investig need prefer peopl crc postop period regard on offer theoret foundat enhanc complianc perspect particip prefer method qualit descript studi conduct involv semistructur interview 14 peopl crc postop period tertiari hospit xiamen china march april 2025 data analysi integr unstructur observ data detail oral nutrit supplement on regimen use particip research team employ themat analysi synthes find result two primari theme emerg encompass seven subthem 1 demand prefer oral nutrit supplement particip valu portabl practic standard scientif valid clear label also sought improv costeffect reimburs via medic insur rapid signific nutrit support effect prefer diseasespecif formula 2 demand prefer on regimen particip emphas credibl align person habit prefer provis educ guidanc conclus peopl crc postop period report suboptim experi on exhibit notabl misconcept use indic current regimen fail address treatment need prefer clinician adopt personcent approach design on regimen tailor prefer improv accept complianc
cancer,"Cuproptosis is a newly discovered programmed cell death regulated by lipoic acid synthase (LIAS) in cancer cells. However, its functions in Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that in human ESCC cells, TRIM21 facilitates the K63-linked ubiquitination dependent translocation of ALKBH5 from cytosol to nucleus and augments its m6A demethylase activity. LIAS mRNA was demethylated by ALKBH5, and then further identified by reader IGF2BP3, which comprehensively caused the lower expression of LIAS. Moreover, O-GlcNAc transferase OGT facilitated TRIM21-mediated K63-ubiquitination of ALKBH5. Combined treatment with an OGT inhibitor OSMI-1 and copper ionophore elesclomol eliminates tumor growth and remarkably enhances the sensitivity of tumor cells to cisplatin. Together, our study identifies TRIM21 Ubiquitinated-ALKBH5 as a critical gatekeeper to restrict cuproptosis, and such mechanism may contribute to tumor development and drug resistance in ESCC.",cuproptosi newli discov program cell death regul lipoic acid synthas lia cancer cell howev function esophag squamou cell carcinoma escc underli mechan remain unclear show human escc cell trim21 facilit k63link ubiquitin depend transloc alkbh5 cytosol nucleu augment m6a demethylas activ lia mrna demethyl alkbh5 identifi reader igf2bp3 comprehens caus lower express lia moreov oglcnac transferas ogt facilit trim21medi k63ubiquitin alkbh5 combin treatment ogt inhibitor osmi1 copper ionophor elesclomol elimin tumor growth remark enhanc sensit tumor cell cisplatin togeth studi identifi trim21 ubiquitinatedalkbh5 critic gatekeep restrict cuproptosi mechan may contribut tumor develop drug resist escc

cancer,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) features a dense desmoplastic stroma, limiting drug delivery and promoting chemoresistance. While anti-angiogenic strategies have shown limited success, underexplored pro-angiogenic approaches may improve perfusion and treatment efficacy. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and demonstrates anti-cancer effects at longer treatments and pro-healing, angiogenic effects at shorter treatments. We investigated the impact of short CAP treatment on angiogenesis in PDAC using a triple co-culture spheroid model and a turkey in ovo model, mimicking the tumor microenvironment. CAP was applied via the kINPen MED for 15-60 s in vitro and 10-30 s in ovo. In vitro, CAP inhibited endothelial tube formation treatment time-dependently and reduced VEGF-A secretion, while other angiogenic factors remained unchanged. In ovo, vascularization around the tumor was slightly increased in the BH tumors, while not significantly altered within the tumors, except for a significant reduction after 30 s of CAP treatment. Additionally, a significant increase in tumor weight was observed following short CAP treatment. These findings suggest that under standard conditions, short CAP treatment preserves vascular quiescence in PDAC and may exert subtle tumor-modulating effects, highlighting the importance of treatment parameters and model complexity in CAP-based therapeutic strategies.",pancreat ductal adenocarcinoma pdac featur dens desmoplast stroma limit drug deliveri promot chemoresist antiangiogen strategi shown limit success underexplor proangiogen approach may improv perfus treatment efficaci cold atmospher plasma cap gener reactiv oxygen nitrogen speci demonstr anticanc effect longer treatment proheal angiogen effect shorter treatment investig impact short cap treatment angiogenesi pdac use tripl cocultur spheroid model turkey ovo model mimick tumor microenviron cap appli via kinpen med 1560 vitro 1030 ovo vitro cap inhibit endotheli tube format treatment timedepend reduc vegfa secret angiogen factor remain unchang ovo vascular around tumor slightli increas bh tumor significantli alter within tumor except signific reduct 30 cap treatment addit signific increas tumor weight observ follow short cap treatment find suggest standard condit short cap treatment preserv vascular quiescenc pdac may exert subtl tumormodul effect highlight import treatment paramet model complex capbas therapeut strategi
cancer,"Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which mediates transcriptional repression through histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), is highly expressed in aggressive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, despite the elevated EZH2 expression, H3K27me3 levels remain unexpectedly low, suggesting a potential noncanonical role for EZH2 in TNBC. Here we demonstrate that EZH2 directly binds to the transcription factor E2F1, and this interaction is critical for modulating chromatin accessibility by disrupting H3K27me3 deposition. This noncanonical function of EZH2, which operates independently of its methyltransferase activity, is linked to enhanced tumor cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. Our findings reveal that EZH2 functions in a chromatin context-dependent manner by cooperating with E2F1 in TNBC, highlighting that the EZH2-E2F1 interaction, independent of PRC2, plays a key role in remodeling chromatin structure and facilitating TNBC proliferation.",enhanc zest homolog 2 ezh2 catalyt subunit polycomb repress complex 2 prc2 mediat transcript repress histon h3 lysin 27 trimethyl h3k27me3 highli express aggress tripleneg breast cancer tnbc howev despit elev ezh2 express h3k27me3 level remain unexpectedli low suggest potenti noncanon role ezh2 tnbc demonstr ezh2 directli bind transcript factor e2f1 interact critic modul chromatin access disrupt h3k27me3 deposit noncanon function ezh2 oper independ methyltransferas activ link enhanc tumor cell prolifer inhibit apoptosi find reveal ezh2 function chromatin contextdepend manner cooper e2f1 tnbc highlight ezh2e2f1 interact independ prc2 play key role remodel chromatin structur facilit tnbc prolifer
cancer,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) is often hypoxic. EGLN1, which encodes the oxygen sensor PHD2, plays a crucial role not only in the survival of cancer cells but also in regulating other cell types that reside in the TME. In this Review, we explore the role of this protein in some of the key components of the TME, focusing on the functions of EGLN1/PHD2 in endothelial, stromal and immune cells. So far, the activity of EGLN1/PHD2 has been characterized in different cell types, albeit with controversial outcomes in different cancer settings. This Review aims to discuss the role of EGLN1/PHD2 in the TME and the strategies targeting this protein that might be used to hit tumors.",tumor microenviron tme often hypox egln1 encod oxygen sensor phd2 play crucial role surviv cancer cell also regul cell type resid tme review explor role protein key compon tme focus function egln1phd2 endotheli stromal immun cell far activ egln1phd2 character differ cell type albeit controversi outcom differ cancer set review aim discuss role egln1phd2 tme strategi target protein might use hit tumor
cancer,"PURPOSE: As cancer incidence increases, internal medicine (IM) physicians play a growing role in managing the complex medical needs of cancer patients and survivors across the care continuum. However, few residency programs offer structured training in supportive oncology care. We developed a combined Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) Onco-Medicine Track to equip IM residents with skills in cancer prevention, survivorship, symptom management, and interdisciplinary care. METHODS: This 3-year residency track launched in 2015 through a partnership between BCM and MDACC. Residents complete approximately one-third of their training in cancer-focused IM rotations, including onco-hospital medicine, palliative care, supportive care, and subspecialty experiences. Program development was informed by a feasibility assessment and modeled in part on career pathways at the University of California, San Francisco. RESULTS: As of 2024, the program has trained 35 graduates, 57% of whom pursued oncology-related careers. Board pass rates and in-training exam scores for track residents were comparable to peers. Resident evaluations emphasized the educational value of rotations focused on cancer screening, managing treatment-related complications, and improving communication skills as well as survivorship-focused competencies. Graduates have received national recognition through awards, presentations, and leadership roles. Demand remains strong, with consistent NRMP match fills and high applicant volumes. CONCLUSIONS: The BCM-MDACC Onco-Medicine Track demonstrates a sustainable and scalable model for preparing internists in supportive cancer care and survivorship. Its integrated structure may inform similar efforts at other institutions, even those without access to a comprehensive cancer center.",purpos cancer incid increas intern medicin im physician play grow role manag complex medic need cancer patient survivor across care continuum howev resid program offer structur train support oncolog care develop combin baylor colleg medicin bcm univers texa md anderson cancer center mdacc oncomedicin track equip im resid skill cancer prevent survivorship symptom manag interdisciplinari care method 3year resid track launch 2015 partnership bcm mdacc resid complet approxim onethird train cancerfocus im rotat includ oncohospit medicin palli care support care subspecialti experi program develop inform feasibl assess model part career pathway univers california san francisco result 2024 program train 35 graduat 57 pursu oncologyrel career board pass rate intrain exam score track resid compar peer resid evalu emphas educ valu rotat focus cancer screen manag treatmentrel complic improv commun skill well survivorshipfocus compet graduat receiv nation recognit award present leadership role demand remain strong consist nrmp match fill high applic volum conclus bcmmdacc oncomedicin track demonstr sustain scalabl model prepar internist support cancer care survivorship integr structur may inform similar effort institut even without access comprehens cancer center
cancer,"PURPOSE: Although rare, septic shock can develop following the closure of an ileostomy created during colorectal cancer surgery. In such cases, bacterial translocation (BT) is considered the primary diagnosis, and appropriate treatment is provided. Herein, we investigated the risk factors of BT following ileostomy closure after colorectal cancer surgery. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted using the colorectal cancer database of Nagasaki University, focusing on 91 patients who received ileostomy closure after colorectal cancer surgery. The patients were divided into two groups based on the occurrence of BT, defined as fever exceeding 38  degrees C without an identifiable cause, and data regarding patient background, surgical factors, and postoperative factors were assessed. RESULTS: BT occurred in 12 of 91 patients. No significant differences were observed between the groups of patients in terms of background factors but C-reactive protein levels on postoperative days 3 and 7 were significantly higher in the BT group than in the non-BT group (BT group vs. non-BT group [median], day 3: 6.64 mg/dL vs. 3.79 mg/dL, p = 0.0026; day 7: 5.10 mg/dL vs. 1.52 mg/dL, p = 0.0007). Additionally, the rate of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy administration was significantly higher in the BT than in the non-BT group (BT group vs. non-BT group: 83.3% vs. 43.0%, p = 0.0123). The pathological findings from resected specimens showed that mucosal height was lower in the anal side than in the oral side. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant chemotherapy may significantly increase the risk of BT after ileostomy closure following colorectal cancer surgery.",purpos although rare septic shock develop follow closur ileostomi creat colorect cancer surgeri case bacteri transloc bt consid primari diagnosi appropri treatment provid herein investig risk factor bt follow ileostomi closur colorect cancer surgeri method retrospect analysi conduct use colorect cancer databas nagasaki univers focus 91 patient receiv ileostomi closur colorect cancer surgeri patient divid two group base occurr bt defin fever exceed 38 degre c without identifi caus data regard patient background surgic factor postop factor assess result bt occur 12 91 patient signific differ observ group patient term background factor creactiv protein level postop day 3 7 significantli higher bt group nonbt group bt group vs nonbt group median day 3 664 mgdl vs 379 mgdl p 00026 day 7 510 mgdl vs 152 mgdl p 00007 addit rate postop adjuv chemotherapi administr significantli higher bt nonbt group bt group vs nonbt group 833 vs 430 p 00123 patholog find resect specimen show mucos height lower anal side oral side conclus adjuv chemotherapi may significantli increas risk bt ileostomi closur follow colorect cancer surgeri
cancer,"PURPOSE: Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is associated with a high symptom burden that negatively impacts daily functioning and quality of life. A better understanding of the time course and relationships between these constructs can help tailor rehabilitation interventions in the context of disease progression. The objectives were to describe and compare the trajectories in mobility, participation, and symptom burden and to assess associations and explore predictors of mobility change. METHODS: Secondary data analysis of a longitudinal cohort study of 110 participants with NSCLC. Mobility and participation were measured using the WHODAS 2.0 subdomains, and symptom burden was measured using the POS-S. Data at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 months were analysed using repeated measures ANOVA and regression models. Change scores were compared over time, and multiple linear regression identified predictors of mobility change. RESULTS: Overall, mobility and symptom burden remained stable, whilst participation scores showed improvement at 4 and 6 months (p < 0.05). Both improvements and declines in mobility status were correlated with changes in participation (r = 0.297-0.462, p < 0.001) and symptom burden (r = 0.151-0.368, p < 0.05). Baseline symptom burden was a significant predictor of mobility change, even after adjusting for demographic and clinical variables (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Improvements in participation despite stable mobility and symptom burden suggest an adaptive response and/or benefit from care. Mobility, related to both symptom burden and participation, offers a functional indicator that could be used to focus rehabilitation in advanced NSCLC.",purpos advanc nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc associ high symptom burden neg impact daili function qualiti life better understand time cours relationship construct help tailor rehabilit intervent context diseas progress object describ compar trajectori mobil particip symptom burden assess associ explor predictor mobil chang method secondari data analysi longitudin cohort studi 110 particip nsclc mobil particip measur use whoda 20 subdomain symptom burden measur use poss data baselin 2 4 6 month analys use repeat measur anova regress model chang score compar time multipl linear regress identifi predictor mobil chang result overal mobil symptom burden remain stabl whilst particip score show improv 4 6 month p 005 improv declin mobil statu correl chang particip r 02970462 p 0001 symptom burden r 01510368 p 005 baselin symptom burden signific predictor mobil chang even adjust demograph clinic variabl p 0003 conclus improv particip despit stabl mobil symptom burden suggest adapt respons andor benefit care mobil relat symptom burden particip offer function indic could use focu rehabilit advanc nsclc
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Shape-sensing robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (ssRAB) combined with intraoperative imaging optimizes tool-lesion relationship during the sampling of focal pulmonary lesions. Nevertheless, confirmation of tool-in-lesion status is not equivalent to diagnostic sampling. This gap may be bridged by the addition of transbronchial cryobiopsy (TBCB) to traditional transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) and forceps biopsy (TBFB); however, the performance of TBCB, specifically with the 1.7-mm cryoprobe, has raised significant safety concerns. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the safety of TBCB using the 1.7-mm cryoprobe, added into ssRAB-guided TBNA and TBFB, and performed via a protocolized approach in a cancer center patient population undergoing lung biopsy for focal parenchymal pulmonary lesions. Secondary endpoints included diagnostic yield, accuracy, and TBFB vs. TBCB tissue quality measures. METHODS: This prospective, single center, single arm study, enrolled patients referred for sampling of focal pulmonary parenchymal lesions. All procedures were performed with image-guided ssRAB with prophylactic balloon occlusion. The primary endpoint was a safety composite of grade >/= 2 bleeding, grade >/= 2 pneumothorax, or other biopsy-related grade >/= 3 complication. Secondary endpoints included conservative diagnostic yield, diagnostic accuracy for malignancy, and biopsy specimen quality measures. RESULTS: Fifty-one participants were enrolled and underwent image-guided ssRAB. The primary severe adverse event rate was 0% (95% CI 0.0-7.9). The conservative diagnostic yield was 92% and the diagnostic accuracy for malignancy was 90%. TBCB was superior to forceps biopsy in measures of total specimen dimensions, diagnostic tissue area, and degree of crush artifact (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). CONCLUSION: In cancer patients with localized parenchymal lung lesions, the incorporation of a rigorous safety protocol into image-guided ssRAB allows for the safe acquisition of high-quality peripheral lung TBCB specimen, utilizing the 1.7-mm cryoprobe.

It plays a crucial role in various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and organ failure. This review systematically explores the key mechanisms underlying ferroptosis, including polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipid (PUFA-PL) peroxidation, iron metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, we summarize major endogenous ferroptosis defense systems, including the SLC7A11-glutathione (GSH)-glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) axis, the ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1)-ubiquinol (CoQH(2)) system, the mitochondrial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH)-CoQH(2) pathway, and the guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1)-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) pathway, which act as critical brakes on ferroptosis. Furthermore, we discuss various small-molecule inhibitors targeting ferroptosis, categorized by their mechanisms of action, including iron chelators, lipid peroxidation inhibitors, antioxidants, and regulatory pathway modulators.

cancer,"Nucleophosmin (NPM1), a nucleolar protein frequently mutated in hematopoietic malignancies, is overexpressed in several solid tumors with poorly understood functional roles. Here, we demonstrate that Npm1 is upregulated after APC loss in WNT-responsive tissues and supports WNT-driven intestinal and liver tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, NPM1 loss induces ribosome pausing and accumulation at the 5'-end of coding sequences, triggering a protein synthesis stress response and p53 activation, which mediate this antitumorigenic effect. Collectively, our data identify NPM1 as a critical WNT effector that sustains WNT-driven hyperproliferation and tumorigenesis by attenuating the integrated stress response and p53 activation. Notably, NPM1 expression correlates with elevated WNT signaling and proliferation in human colorectal cancer (CRC), while CRCs harboring NPM1 deletions exhibit preferential TP53 inactivation, underscoring the clinical relevance of our findings. Being dispensable for adult epithelial homeostasis, NPM1 represents a promising therapeutic target in p53-proficient WNT-driven tumors, including treatment-refractory KRAS-mutant CRC, and hepatic cancers.",nucleophosmin npm1 nucleolar protein frequent mutat hematopoiet malign overexpress sever solid tumor poorli understood function role demonstr npm1 upregul apc loss wntrespons tissu support wntdriven intestin liver tumorigenesi mechanist npm1 loss induc ribosom paus accumul 5end code sequenc trigger protein synthesi stress respons p53 activ mediat antitumorigen effect collect data identifi npm1 critic wnt effector sustain wntdriven hyperprolifer tumorigenesi attenu integr stress respons p53 activ notabl npm1 express correl elev wnt signal prolifer human colorect cancer crc crc harbor npm1 delet exhibit preferenti tp53 inactiv underscor clinic relev find dispens adult epitheli homeostasi npm1 repres promis therapeut target p53profici wntdriven tumor includ treatmentrefractori krasmut crc hepat cancer
cancer,"Cervical cancer poses a significant threat to women's health. Although folic acid (FA) has been recognized as a protective factor in cervical carcinogenesis, its precise molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify Dickkopf Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor 3 (DKK3), an inhibitor of the Wnt signaling pathway, as a potential target of FA. This study provides systematic evidence that DKK3 expression decreases during cervical squamous epithelial carcinogenesis, showing progressive downregulation from squamous intraepithelial lesions to squamous cell carcinoma, which correlates with advanced FIGO stage and lymphovascular space invasion. Functional assays confirmed DKK3's tumor-suppressive role and therapeutic potential. DKK3 overexpression downregulated beta-catenin protein levels and inhibited malignant behavior in SiHa cells, whereas its knockdown produced opposite effects. Notably, this study demonstrated for the first time that FA intervention upregulated DKK3 expression, suppressed Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, leading to a reduction in beta-catenin protein abundance, and exerted potent anti-tumor effects-suppressing proliferation, migration, and invasion while promoting apoptosis. Even under DKK3-knockdown conditions, FA intervention partially reversed beta-catenin accumulation by enhancing residual DKK3 expression. Overall, this study establishes the prognostic and interventional value of DKK3 in cervical squamous epithelial carcinogenesis. FA intervention may serve as an effective strategy to restore DKK3 expression to inhibit the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, thereby exerting antitumor activity. Future cervical cancer prevention and treatment strategies may benefit from dynamic monitoring of DKK3 expression to identify potential beneficiaries and provide targeted FA intervention.",cervic cancer pose signific threat women health although folic acid fa recogn protect factor cervic carcinogenesi precis molecular mechan remain incomplet understood identifi dickkopf wnt signal pathway inhibitor 3 dkk3 inhibitor wnt signal pathway potenti target fa studi provid systemat evid dkk3 express decreas cervic squamou epitheli carcinogenesi show progress downregul squamou intraepitheli lesion squamou cell carcinoma correl advanc figo stage lymphovascular space invas function assay confirm dkk3 tumorsuppress role therapeut potenti dkk3 overexpress downregul betacatenin protein level inhibit malign behavior siha cell wherea knockdown produc opposit effect notabl studi demonstr first time fa intervent upregul dkk3 express suppress wntbetacatenin signal lead reduct betacatenin protein abund exert potent antitumor effectssuppress prolifer migrat invas promot apoptosi even dkk3knockdown condit fa intervent partial revers betacatenin accumul enhanc residu dkk3 express overal studi establish prognost intervent valu dkk3 cervic squamou epitheli carcinogenesi fa intervent may serv effect strategi restor dkk3 express inhibit wntbetacatenin pathway therebi exert antitumor activ futur cervic cancer prevent treatment strategi may benefit dynam monitor dkk3 express identifi potenti beneficiari provid target fa intervent
cancer,"This paper introduces a high-sensitivity, multimode graphene-based metamaterial (MM) biosensor for refractive index sensing, featuring a periodic array of gold (Au) double-split elliptical resonators (DSERs) on a graphene-coated silicon dioxide (SiO(2)) substrate with an Au reflective base layer. The proposed design is analyzed using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. The unique double-split elliptical geometry significantly enhances electromagnetic field confinement and enables the excitation of multiple distinct resonance modes, outperforming conventional circular or rectangular resonators that typically support only single- or dual-mode responses. The novelty of this work lies in the integration of a graphene-metal hybrid structure that combines tunable plasmonic properties of graphene with strong localized surface plasmon resonances of DSERs, resulting in multimode operation, improved tunability, and superior sensing performance. The bottom gold layer effectively suppresses transmission and reinforces field confinement within the active region. The sensor operates across 650-1500 nm, supporting five well-separated resonance modes that provide multiple sensing channels, enhancing detection efficiency and spectral flexibility. Optimized structural parameters such as the Au array thickness, SiO(2) layer thickness, and resonator width further improve its performance. The biosensor achieves a maximum sensitivity of 714.28 nm/RIU, a figure of merit (FoM) of 51.02 1/RIU, and a quality factor (QF) of 73.42 for breast cancer cell detection. Moreover, it successfully distinguishes between normal and cancerous cells (basal, breast, and cervical), demonstrating its strong potential for biomedical diagnostics and optical sensing applications. These results position the proposed multimode graphene-based biosensor as a promising platform for next-generation photonic and biomedical sensing technologies.",paper introduc highsensit multimod graphenebas metamateri mm biosensor refract index sens featur period array gold au doublesplit ellipt reson dser grapheneco silicon dioxid sio2 substrat au reflect base layer propos design analyz use finitediffer timedomain fdtd simul uniqu doublesplit ellipt geometri significantli enhanc electromagnet field confin enabl excit multipl distinct reson mode outperform convent circular rectangular reson typic support singl dualmod respons novelti work lie integr graphenemet hybrid structur combin tunabl plasmon properti graphen strong local surfac plasmon reson dser result multimod oper improv tunabl superior sens perform bottom gold layer effect suppress transmiss reinforc field confin within activ region sensor oper across 6501500 nm support five wellsepar reson mode provid multipl sens channel enhanc detect effici spectral flexibl optim structur paramet au array thick sio2 layer thick reson width improv perform biosensor achiev maximum sensit 71428 nmriu figur merit fom 5102 1riu qualiti factor qf 7342 breast cancer cell detect moreov success distinguish normal cancer cell basal breast cervic demonstr strong potenti biomed diagnost optic sens applic result posit propos multimod graphenebas biosensor promis platform nextgener photon biomed sens technolog
cancer,"The increasing global use of unvalidated herbal products poses substantial health risks, highlighting the importance of rigorous toxicity evaluations. In the Elgon sub-region, Rhoicissus tridentata extracts are traditionally used to treat prostate cancer, but the absence of standardized dosages restricts their potential use and limits evidence for informing chemotherapeutic applications. This study aimed to investigate the subacute toxicity of R. tridentata extracts in Wistar albino rats.

Histological biomarkers were analyzed using Coulter Counter Hamatology analyzer while biochemical indices were analyzed using COBAS INTEGRA Chemistry Plus 600, but eosinophils increased significantly (p </= 0.0001), confirming mild toxicity. To guarantee the safe use of R. tridentata in therapy, determining the maximum dose that produces no adverse effects (NOAEL) is essential to inform dosing in sub-chronic and sub-acute toxicity.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: It is estimated that approximately 80% of childhood cancer cases occur in resource-limited settings and that most unvaccinated children live in middle-income countries. This creates an overlap of burdens for children with cancer, who are especially vulnerable to vaccine-preventable infections such as influenza and invasive pneumococcal disease. Given the complexity of vaccinating children with cancer because of the multidisciplinary care they require, it is unclear how such vaccination is achieved in these settings. METHODS: A self-administered, anonymized, cross-sectional survey was distributed to providers of healthcare for children with cancer in Latin America and the Caribbean through a contact list of 3236 email addresses. A total of 378 participant responses were included in the final analysis. This study used the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to understand the implementation factors influencing the vaccination of children with cancer in Latin America and the Caribbean. RESULTS: Most respondents (n = 246, 65.3%) reported that vaccines were always, almost always, or often available for administration at their institution - and were willing to recommend children with cancer for vaccination. Most respondents reported receiving no training or education on immunizing children with cancer at their current institution (n = 297, 78.6%) or before joining it (n = 242, 64.0%). Furthermore, only a small minority reported working in institutions with written policies on vaccinating children with cancer (n = 53, 14.0%) or clinical guidelines (n = 97, 25.7%) for vaccinating these patients. Respondents estimated that most pediatric patients with cancer at their hospital were not up to date on childhood immunizations and did not receive the annual influenza vaccine. Although most respondents (n = 345, 91.3%) reported that their government provides funding for childhood vaccinations, fewer than half (n = 183, 48.5%) reported that government funding was available for re-immunizing children with cancer. CONCLUSIONS: We found a clear willingness to recommend vaccines for children with cancer in Latin America and the Caribbean, a trend not found in similar studies in the literature. Our findings support the notion that interventions to improve vaccination for children with cancer should gear their efforts towards building an institutional culture that prioritizes immunization for both patients and staff and that supports providers in their already established practice of recommending vaccines to their patients.",background estim approxim 80 childhood cancer case occur resourcelimit set unvaccin children live middleincom countri creat overlap burden children cancer especi vulner vaccineprevent infect influenza invas pneumococc diseas given complex vaccin children cancer multidisciplinari care requir unclear vaccin achiev set method selfadminist anonym crosssect survey distribut provid healthcar children cancer latin america caribbean contact list 3236 email address total 378 particip respons includ final analysi studi use consolid framework implement research understand implement factor influenc vaccin children cancer latin america caribbean result respond n 246 653 report vaccin alway almost alway often avail administr institut will recommend children cancer vaccin respond report receiv train educ immun children cancer current institut n 297 786 join n 242 640 furthermor small minor report work institut written polici vaccin children cancer n 53 140 clinic guidelin n 97 257 vaccin patient respond estim pediatr patient cancer hospit date childhood immun receiv annual influenza vaccin although respond n 345 913 report govern provid fund childhood vaccin fewer half n 183 485 report govern fund avail reimmun children cancer conclus found clear willing recommend vaccin children cancer latin america caribbean trend found similar studi literatur find support notion intervent improv vaccin children cancer gear effort toward build institut cultur priorit immun patient staff support provid alreadi establish practic recommend vaccin patient
cancer,"Prostate cancer is estimated to contribute to over 35,000 deaths of men residing in the United States, with the majority fatality due to metastatic disease. CDC7 is a kinase that regulates DNA replication and is found elevated during neuroendocrine transdifferentiation in lung and prostate cancer. In this study, we demonstrate that CDC7 is highly expressed in treatment-resistant prostate cancer, with even higher levels observed in treatment-resistant prostate cancer with neuroendocrine phenotype (NEPC). We further identify CDC7 as a critical regulator of prostate tumorigenesis. Downregulation of CDC7 significantly reduces prostate cancer cells growth and invasion in vitro and silencing CDC7 suppresses prostate tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the inhibition of CDC7 using TAK-931, a selective CDC7 inhibitor, significantly reduces the proliferation, migration, and invasion of aggressive prostate cancer cells. TAK-931 treated prostate cancer cells exhibit an abnormal cell cycle profile, suggesting that CDC7 inhibition induces replication stress and promotes apoptosis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CDC7 is a regulator of tumor progression in prostate cancer and represents new therapeutic target in advanced prostate cancer.",prostat cancer estim contribut 35000 death men resid unit state major fatal due metastat diseas cdc7 kinas regul dna replic found elev neuroendocrin transdifferenti lung prostat cancer studi demonstr cdc7 highli express treatmentresist prostat cancer even higher level observ treatmentresist prostat cancer neuroendocrin phenotyp nepc identifi cdc7 critic regul prostat tumorigenesi downregul cdc7 significantli reduc prostat cancer cell growth invas vitro silenc cdc7 suppress prostat tumor growth vivo furthermor demonstr inhibit cdc7 use tak931 select cdc7 inhibitor significantli reduc prolifer migrat invas aggress prostat cancer cell tak931 treat prostat cancer cell exhibit abnorm cell cycl profil suggest cdc7 inhibit induc replic stress promot apoptosi collect find demonstr cdc7 regul tumor progress prostat cancer repres new therapeut target advanc prostat cancer
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by its aggressive clinical behavior and propensity for distant metastasis, presents critical challenges in therapeutic management. Emerging evidence implicates lipid metabolic reprogramming as a key facilitator of tumor progression and metastatic dissemination. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying lipid metabolic dysregulation in TNBC metastasis remain poorly characterized. Our work systematically elucidates the mechanistic role of ALDH3A2 in orchestrating lipid metabolic adaptations that drive breast cancer metastasis. METHODS: Transcriptomic analysis of clinical datasets identified metastasis-related metabolic regulators. Cellular migration/invasion assays and murine metastasis models were utilized to assess metastatic effects of ALDH3A2. Lipidomic profiling coupled with pathway analysis characterized metabolic alterations. Mechanistic studies integrated western blot analysis with lipid droplet quantification. Computational approaches including structure-based virtual screening and molecular docking simulations were employed for inhibitor discovery. RESULTS: ALDH3A2 was significantly upregulated in TNBC clinical specimens and showed significant association with adverse clinical outcomes. Functional validation confirmed that ALDH3A2 potentiates TNBC cell migration/invasion through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) activation. Metabolic profiling revealed ALDH3A2-driven lipid accumulation, evidenced by increased lipid droplet formation and elevated triglyceride levels. Specifically, arachidonic acid (AA) enrichment was observed in ALDH3A2-overexpressing cells, corresponding to enhanced glycerophospholipid metabolism. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that ALDH3A2-mediated AMP/ATP imbalance suppresses AMPK phosphorylation while activating mTOR/SREBP1 signaling. mTOR inhibition effectively attenuated ALDH3A2-induced lipid metabolic alterations. Importantly, oxaliplatin was identified as a potential therapeutic agent targeting ALDH3A2-mediated AA metabolism to suppress metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Our work establishes ALDH3A2 as a pivotal regulator of lipid metabolic reprogramming in TNBC metastasis, providing mechanistic insights into AA-mediated tumor progression. These findings position ALDH3A2 as a promising therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker for TNBC management.",background tripl neg breast cancer tnbc character aggress clinic behavior propens distant metastasi present critic challeng therapeut manag emerg evid implic lipid metabol reprogram key facilit tumor progress metastat dissemin howev precis molecular mechan underli lipid metabol dysregul tnbc metastasi remain poorli character work systemat elucid mechanist role aldh3a2 orchestr lipid metabol adapt drive breast cancer metastasi method transcriptom analysi clinic dataset identifi metastasisrel metabol regul cellular migrationinvas assay murin metastasi model util assess metastat effect aldh3a2 lipidom profil coupl pathway analysi character metabol alter mechanist studi integr western blot analysi lipid droplet quantif comput approach includ structurebas virtual screen molecular dock simul employ inhibitor discoveri result aldh3a2 significantli upregul tnbc clinic specimen show signific associ advers clinic outcom function valid confirm aldh3a2 potenti tnbc cell migrationinvas epithelialmesenchym transit emt activ metabol profil reveal aldh3a2driven lipid accumul evidenc increas lipid droplet format elev triglycerid level specif arachidon acid aa enrich observ aldh3a2overexpress cell correspond enhanc glycerophospholipid metabol mechanist studi demonstr aldh3a2medi ampatp imbal suppress ampk phosphoryl activ mtorsrebp1 signal mtor inhibit effect attenu aldh3a2induc lipid metabol alter importantli oxaliplatin identifi potenti therapeut agent target aldh3a2medi aa metabol suppress metastasi conclus work establish aldh3a2 pivot regul lipid metabol reprogram tnbc metastasi provid mechanist insight aamedi tumor progress find posit aldh3a2 promis therapeut target prognost biomark tnbc manag

The collected data included demographic characteristics, pathological findings, and laboratory results. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify potential factors associated with the occurrence of MI. The Kaplan-Meier method was employed to estimate disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to assess the impact of various factors on patient prognosis. RESULTS: Among 288 patients, MI was detected in 93 patients (32.3%). Positive microvasculature biomarkers, positive regional lymph nodes (RNP), poor differentiation grade, and reduced MCV might be independent risk factors for MI. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that MI, tumor site, RNP, grade, chemotherapy, chloride (Cl) and thrombin time were independent risk factors for DFS and OS. Among 93 patients with MI, no statistically significant difference in prognosis was observed between the MVI and LVI subtypes. CONCLUSION: Positive microvasculature biomarkers, positive RNP, poor histological grade, and reduced MCV levels might serve as independent risk factors for the development of MI. The presence of MI was independent risk factors for DFS and OS. However, no significant prognostic association was observed between the specific origin of invasion (whether MVI or LVI).",object studi aim investig risk factor associ microvasculatur invas mi patient pancreat cancer evalu prognost signific method retrospect analysi conduct clinic data 288 pancreat cancer patient underw radic pancreatectomi june 2012 june 2024 collect data includ demograph characterist patholog find laboratori result logist regress analysi perform identifi potenti factor associ occurr mi kaplanmei method employ estim diseasefre surviv df overal surviv os univari multivari cox proport hazard regress model appli assess impact variou factor patient prognosi result among 288 patient mi detect 93 patient 323 posit microvasculatur biomark posit region lymph node rnp poor differenti grade reduc mcv might independ risk factor mi multivari cox regress analysi show mi tumor site rnp grade chemotherapi chlorid cl thrombin time independ risk factor df os among 93 patient mi statist signific differ prognosi observ mvi lvi subtyp conclus posit microvasculatur biomark posit rnp poor histolog grade reduc mcv level might serv independ risk factor develop mi presenc mi independ risk factor df os howev signific prognost associ observ specif origin invas whether mvi lvi
cancer,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) is increasingly recognized as a critical modulator of the initiation, progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance of various cancers. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the predominant stromal cell population within the TME, play pivotal roles in these processes through their remarkable phenotypic and functional heterogeneity. Emerging evidence underscores the diversity in the origins, phenotypes, and functions of CAFs, highlighting their ability to adaptively influence tumor biology in a context-dependent manner. CAFs facilitate cancer malignancy via multiple interconnected mechanisms, including the secretion of soluble bioactive factors, the release of exosomes, the metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells, the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and the modulation of the immune microenvironment. CAFs have emerged as attractive and viable therapeutic targets. Recent efforts have focused on developing therapies that disrupt the protumorigenic activities of CAFs or reprogram them toward tumor-suppressive phenotypes. Several of these strategies have shown promise and are advancing into clinical trials. In this review, we comprehensively discuss recent advancements in our understanding of the heterogeneity of CAFs, elucidate their multifaceted interactions within the TME, and explore novel therapeutic strategies targeting CAFs across various cancer types. Our review aims to foster the translation of preclinical insights into clinically effective interventions targeting CAFs.",tumor microenviron tme increasingli recogn critic modul initi progress metastasi therapeut resist variou cancer cancerassoci fibroblast caf predomin stromal cell popul within tme play pivot role process remark phenotyp function heterogen emerg evid underscor divers origin phenotyp function caf highlight abil adapt influenc tumor biolog contextdepend manner caf facilit cancer malign via multipl interconnect mechan includ secret solubl bioactiv factor releas exosom metabol reprogram tumor cell remodel extracellular matrix ecm modul immun microenviron caf emerg attract viabl therapeut target recent effort focus develop therapi disrupt protumorigen activ caf reprogram toward tumorsuppress phenotyp sever strategi shown promis advanc clinic trial review comprehens discuss recent advanc understand heterogen caf elucid multifacet interact within tme explor novel therapeut strategi target caf across variou cancer type review aim foster translat preclin insight clinic effect intervent target caf
cancer,"BACKGROUND: ITGB2 is a critical integrin mediator of immune cell activation and trafficking. Its expression has been claimed as exclusive to hematopoietic cells. Consequently, the significance of cancer cell-intrinsic ITGB2 in solid tumor progression and therapy has not been rigorously evaluated. METHODS: We leveraged single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing, real-time quantitative PCR, multiplex immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, immunoblotting, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1-dependent adhesion and proliferation assays to uncover melanoma cell-intrinsic ITGB2 functional expression, association with clinical tumor progression, activation, protumorigenic signaling, adhesive and proliferative functions utilizing patient melanoma biospecimens, established human and murine melanoma lines. In vivo tumorigenicity studies in immunocompromised NOD/SCID interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain null (NSG), immunocompetent wildtype, and Icam1 knockout (KO) C57BL/6 mice were performed to dissect melanoma-ITGB2 downstream pathway activity and functions in tumor growth and metastasis. The cancer cell-intrinsic ITGB2 axis was targeted using CRISPR/Cas9-based Itgb2 KO, blocking ITGB2 antibodies, ITGB2-activating CD44 crosslinking, and pharmacologic inhibition of ITGB2-dependent Wnt signaling using LGK974, zamaporvint, and FDA-approved pyrvinium pamoate repurposed for cancer therapy. RESULTS: This work demonstrates nonhematopoietic expression and protumorigenic functions of ITGB2 intrinsic to melanoma cells. Tumor cell-ITGB2 mediated adhesion to ICAM-1, promoted cancer progression in preclinical melanoma models, was enriched in clinical metastatic versus primary melanomas or benign nevi, and predicted sentinel lymph node metastasis in patients with primary disease. Consistently, inhibition of melanoma cell-intrinsic ITGB2 using blocking antibodies or Itgb2 gene KO potently suppressed ICAM-1-mediated melanoma cell adhesion, tumor growth, and metastatic dissemination. Melanoma cell-ITGB2:ICAM-1 interaction activated downstream Wnt signaling, the pharmacologic inhibition of which suppressed melanoma-ITGB2-mediated tumorigenesis. CONCLUSIONS: This work overturns the longstanding paradigm that ITGB2 is restricted to leukocytes by discovering a tumor cell-intrinsic ITGB2:ICAM-1:Wnt protumorigenic axis as a bona fide cancer therapeutic target in melanoma.",background itgb2 critic integrin mediat immun cell activ traffick express claim exclus hematopoiet cell consequ signific cancer cellintrins itgb2 solid tumor progress therapi rigor evalu method leverag singlecel bulk rna sequenc realtim quantit pcr multiplex immunofluoresc flow cytometri immunoblot intercellular adhes molecul icam1depend adhes prolifer assay uncov melanoma cellintrins itgb2 function express associ clinic tumor progress activ protumorigen signal adhes prolif function util patient melanoma biospecimen establish human murin melanoma line vivo tumorigen studi immunocompromis nodscid interleukin2 receptor gamma chain null nsg immunocompet wildtyp icam1 knockout ko c57bl6 mice perform dissect melanomaitgb2 downstream pathway activ function tumor growth metastasi cancer cellintrins itgb2 axi target use crisprcas9bas itgb2 ko block itgb2 antibodi itgb2activ cd44 crosslink pharmacolog inhibit itgb2depend wnt signal use lgk974 zamaporvint fdaapprov pyrvinium pamoat repurpos cancer therapi result work demonstr nonhematopoiet express protumorigen function itgb2 intrins melanoma cell tumor cellitgb2 mediat adhes icam1 promot cancer progress preclin melanoma model enrich clinic metastat versu primari melanoma benign nevi predict sentinel lymph node metastasi patient primari diseas consist inhibit melanoma cellintrins itgb2 use block antibodi itgb2 gene ko potent suppress icam1medi melanoma cell adhes tumor growth metastat dissemin melanoma cellitgb2icam1 interact activ downstream wnt signal pharmacolog inhibit suppress melanomaitgb2medi tumorigenesi conclus work overturn longstand paradigm itgb2 restrict leukocyt discov tumor cellintrins itgb2icam1wnt protumorigen axi bona fide cancer therapeut target melanoma
cancer,"Pre-clinical research on B and NK cell development relies on murine stromal cell-based systems with reduced physiological relevance and clinical applicability. A serum-free, fully humanized co-culture system utilizing human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) was developed to differentiate CB-CD34+ cells towards B and NK cell lineages. Differentiation dynamics were monitored via flow cytometry, with immunophenotypic analysis tracking progression from progenitors to mature cells. The system generated CD19+ IgM+ immature B cells and CD56+ CD16+ NK cells, recapitulating fetal stages of human lymphopoiesis. Serum-free media conditions ensured reproducibility and high overall yield of CD19+ B (35 +/- 5.32%) and CD56+ NK (28.46 +/- 7.01%) cell progenitors. Flow cytometry identified distinct population peaks, confirming temporal control over differentiation. This clinically relevant platform addresses the limitations of traditional models by providing a more physiologically accurate human microenvironment. The serum-free system supports applications in disease modeling, genotoxic compound screening, and mutational studies of hematopoiesis. By enabling scalable production of B and NK cells it aims to accelerate translational research for immunodeficiencies, cancer immunotherapy, and hematopoietic disorders.",preclin research b nk cell develop reli murin stromal cellbas system reduc physiolog relev clinic applic serumfre fulli human cocultur system util human bone marrowderiv mesenchym stromal cell bmmsc develop differenti cbcd34 cell toward b nk cell lineag differenti dynam monitor via flow cytometri immunophenotyp analysi track progress progenitor matur cell system gener cd19 igm immatur b cell cd56 cd16 nk cell recapitul fetal stage human lymphopoiesi serumfre media condit ensur reproduc high overal yield cd19 b 35 532 cd56 nk 2846 701 cell progenitor flow cytometri identifi distinct popul peak confirm tempor control differenti clinic relev platform address limit tradit model provid physiolog accur human microenviron serumfre system support applic diseas model genotox compound screen mutat studi hematopoiesi enabl scalabl product b nk cell aim acceler translat research immunodefici cancer immunotherapi hematopoiet disord
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma demonstrates limited responsiveness to PD-1 blockade, largely due to its immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). The specific mechanisms by which cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) contribute to immunosuppression in osteosarcoma are not fully understood. METHODS: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on osteosarcoma tissues from patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 therapy to investigate the tumor microenvironment. Cellular composition, gene expression programs, and signaling pathways were analyzed. Functional assays, pull-down and PLA-flow binding validation, and in vivo mouse models were used to dissect the mechanisms by which CAF-derived factors influence CD8(+) T cell function and contribute to immunotherapy response. RESULTS: We identified a subpopulation of CD36(+) CAFs, characterized by adaptive uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL) and activation of the PPARG-FABP4 axis. This metabolic program promoted ANGPTL4 secretion, which bound integrin on CD8(+) T cells and activated the JAK2-STAT3 pathway, leading to T cell exhaustion and impaired effector function. In vivo, administration of VitE effectively scavenged OxLDL, reprogrammed the TME, enhanced CD8(+) T cell infiltration, and synergized with PD-1 blockade to improve tumor control. CONCLUSIONS: CD36(+) CAFs drive immunosuppressive metabolic reprogramming via the OxLDL-PPARG-ANGPTL4 axis, promoting CD8(+) T cell exhaustion and resistance to immunotherapy in osteosarcoma. Targeting this pathway with VitE alleviated CAF-mediated immune suppression and enhanced PD-1 blockade responses in preclinical models, providing a rationale for metabolism-based combinatorial strategies in osteosarcoma.",background osteosarcoma demonstr limit respons pd1 blockad larg due immunosuppress tumor microenviron tme specif mechan cancerassoci fibroblast caf contribut immunosuppress osteosarcoma fulli understood method perform singlecel rna sequenc scrnaseq osteosarcoma tissu patient treat neoadjuv chemotherapi antipd1 therapi investig tumor microenviron cellular composit gene express program signal pathway analyz function assay pulldown plaflow bind valid vivo mous model use dissect mechan cafderiv factor influenc cd8 cell function contribut immunotherapi respons result identifi subpopul cd36 caf character adapt uptak oxid lowdens lipoprotein oxldl activ ppargfabp4 axi metabol program promot angptl4 secret bound integrin cd8 cell activ jak2stat3 pathway lead cell exhaust impair effector function vivo administr vite effect scaveng oxldl reprogram tme enhanc cd8 cell infiltr synerg pd1 blockad improv tumor control conclus cd36 caf drive immunosuppress metabol reprogram via oxldlppargangptl4 axi promot cd8 cell exhaust resist immunotherapi osteosarcoma target pathway vite allevi cafmedi immun suppress enhanc pd1 blockad respons preclin model provid rational metabolismbas combinatori strategi osteosarcoma
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer (CC) is the most common and second-most deadly cancer among Peruvian women, despite national authorities' sustained political and budgetary efforts to improve Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, screening for early detection of cervical cancer, and making treatment more accessible. Considering the importance of the health system in CC prevention and control, this article examines the role of the health system as a whole in the CC screening in Peru, a dimension that previous studies have not comprehensively covered. To this end, this article utilizes the WHO's building blocks framework as an analytical tool to examine the performance of the health system when providing services to prevent, detect, and treat CC. METHODS: The research took place in the region of Madre de Dios, located southeast of the Peruvian Amazon. Madre de Dios reports the second-highest CC mortality rate in the country, and a lack of oncologic treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, pediatrics, and surgical) and palliative care units. This qualitative study is grounded in in-depth interviews with key informants in Lima and Madre de Dios, as well as an analysis of report records provided by health authorities in Madre de Dios and Lima. The interviews were conducted between November 2022 and August 2023. They are policy experts with experience in designing national-level health policies, as well as health officials in Madre de Dios. Additionally, they have conducted interviews with representatives of civil society organisations in Madre de Dios. Additionally, we analyzed the anonymized records of Pap smear results collected in Madre de Dios for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. RESULTS: Governance is crucial for organizing CC activities. Vertical national programs and policies are failing to accommodate local solutions and lack sensitivity to the unique characteristics of different contexts. CC policies in Peru are ambitious, and their implementation is challenged in Madre de Dios by the lack of trained human resources at the primary healthcare and hospital level, lack of laboratories, lack of financial resources for patient referrals, poor information system that do not allow patient follow-up, and lack of resources and political will to guarantee equipment maintenance. The analysis also highlights the significant shortcomings of organizing health system indicators around services provided, thereby ignoring indicators that assess the impact of health interventions on population health. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis demonstrated the utility of the WHO health system building blocks framework in analyzing the shortcomings of public policies aimed at preventing, detecting, and treating CC. It also provides a comprehensive view of the critical features of the health system that must be considered when designing and implementing interventions to address health conditions, such as CC.",background cervic cancer cc common secondmost deadli cancer among peruvian women despit nation author sustain polit budgetari effort improv human papillomaviru hpv vaccin screen earli detect cervic cancer make treatment access consid import health system cc prevent control articl examin role health system whole cc screen peru dimens previou studi comprehens cover end articl util who build block framework analyt tool examin perform health system provid servic prevent detect treat cc method research took place region madr de dio locat southeast peruvian amazon madr de dio report secondhighest cc mortal rate countri lack oncolog treatment chemotherapi radiotherapi pediatr surgic palli care unit qualit studi ground indepth interview key inform lima madr de dio well analysi report record provid health author madr de dio lima interview conduct novemb 2022 august 2023 polici expert experi design nationallevel health polici well health offici madr de dio addit conduct interview repres civil societi organis madr de dio addit analyz anonym record pap smear result collect madr de dio year 2020 2021 2022 result govern crucial organ cc activ vertic nation program polici fail accommod local solut lack sensit uniqu characterist differ context cc polici peru ambiti implement challeng madr de dio lack train human resourc primari healthcar hospit level lack laboratori lack financi resourc patient referr poor inform system allow patient followup lack resourc polit guarante equip mainten analysi also highlight signific shortcom organ health system indic around servic provid therebi ignor indic assess impact health intervent popul health conclus analysi demonstr util health system build block framework analyz shortcom public polici aim prevent detect treat cc also provid comprehens view critic featur health system must consid design implement intervent address health condit cc
cancer,"The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC) remains limited, highlighting an urgent need for predictive biomarkers. Through multi-omics analysis, we identified two novel MSS CRC subtypes, termed DUB-H and DUB-L. The DUB-L subtype exhibited an inflamed tumor immune microenvironment, a superior response to immune therapy, and better recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to DUB-H. The classifier gene USP7 was selected as a gene of interest due to its specific expression profile, which is highly expressed in MSS CRC but not in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors, and strongly correlated with suppressed immune infiltration. Large-scale clinical analyses confirmed associations between high USP7 expression, microsatellite stability, specific consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), and unfavorable prognosis. Single-cell analysis and multiplex immunofluorescence validated an immune-desert phenotype in USP7-high MSS tumors. Mechanistically, USP7 knockdown in MSS CRC cells enhances the secretion of T-cell-recruiting chemokines (CXCL9/10/11), promoting CD8(+) T cell recruitment and cytotoxicity in vitro. In vivo experiments demonstrated that USP7 blockade enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment in MSS CRC models by remodeling the tumor immune microenvironment, increasing infiltration and function of CD8(+) T and NK cells. Consistently, low USP7 expression is associated with a better response to anti-PD-1 therapy. Overall, we propose a novel DUB-based classification system for MSS CRC and demonstrate that targeting USP7 may overcome immunotherapy resistance by converting immunologically ""cold"" tumors into ""hot"" ones.",efficaci immun checkpoint inhibitor ici microsatellit stabl colorect cancer mss crc remain limit highlight urgent need predict biomark multiom analysi identifi two novel mss crc subtyp term dubh dubl dubl subtyp exhibit inflam tumor immun microenviron superior respons immun therapi better recurrencefre surviv rf compar dubh classifi gene usp7 select gene interest due specif express profil highli express mss crc microsatellit instabilityhigh msih tumor strongli correl suppress immun infiltr largescal clinic analys confirm associ high usp7 express microsatellit stabil specif consensu molecular subtyp cm unfavor prognosi singlecel analysi multiplex immunofluoresc valid immunedesert phenotyp usp7high mss tumor mechanist usp7 knockdown mss crc cell enhanc secret tcellrecruit chemokin cxcl91011 promot cd8 cell recruit cytotox vitro vivo experi demonstr usp7 blockad enhanc efficaci antipd1 treatment mss crc model remodel tumor immun microenviron increas infiltr function cd8 nk cell consist low usp7 express associ better respons antipd1 therapi overal propos novel dubbas classif system mss crc demonstr target usp7 may overcom immunotherapi resist convert immunolog cold tumor hot one
cancer,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The risk of thyroid cancer (TC) has been steadily increasing globally, prompting interest in identifying modifiable risk factors. Coffee, rich in bioactive compounds with potential metabolic effects, may influence TC risk, yet the relationship remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to systematically review and conduct a meta-analysis of observational studies to assess the association between coffee consumption and the risk of TC. METHODS: Comprehensive searches were conducted in major databases through September 2025 to identify appropriate studies. Following the study selection process, relevant data were extracted. Pooled hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models to account for heterogeneity. RESULTS: This meta-analysis of 10 observational (cohort and case-control) studies found no statistically significant association between coffee consumption and TC risk across both study designs. The pooled analysis of four cohort studies (6 effect sizes) yielded a pooled HR of 0.94 (95% CI: [0.74, 1.20], p = 0.645; I(2) = 31%), indicating no meaningful risk reduction. The pooled analysis of six case-control studies (8 effect sizes) showed a non-significant trend toward a protective effect, with a pooled OR of 0.78 (95% CI: [0.59, 1.03], p = 0.091; I(2) = 12%), indicating low heterogeneity across the designs. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the findings suggest that coffee consumption is not significantly associated with an increased risk of TC. Case-control studies indicate a possible protective trend that warrants further investigation, and the low heterogeneity supports the consistency of these results. Nonetheless, additional large-scale prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and clarify the underlying biological mechanisms. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.

cancer,"Extrachromosomal circular DNA (ecDNA) has emerged as a critical determinant of poor clinical outcomes and immune escape in tumors, but the high cost and technical complexity of current detecting techniques limit its broader investigation in cancer immunotherapy. Leveraging the combined machine learning algorithms including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, RandomForest (RF) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), we developed a 12-gene transcriptomic score (EC_score) to predict the existence of ecDNA through RNA-seq. EC_score demonstrated reliable predictive performance in two independent cohorts (AUC > 0.70), validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in both cell lines and clinical samples. Next, we found that EC_score emerged as an independent adverse prognostic factor across multiple immunotherapy cohorts. Notably, high EC_score correlated with cell cycle activation and immunosuppression, characterized by reduced lymphocytes infiltration and upregulated immunosuppressive markers, including MHC molecules, co-inhibitory immune checkpoints and TGF-beta signals. In general, we established and validated a 12-gene signature (EC_score) derived from RNA-seq, offering a novel computational tool for predicting the presence of extrachromosomal circular DNA and stratifying cancer immunotherapy response.",extrachromosom circular dna ecdna emerg critic determin poor clinic outcom immun escap tumor high cost technic complex current detect techniqu limit broader investig cancer immunotherapi leverag combin machin learn algorithm includ least absolut shrinkag select oper lasso regress randomforest rf recurs featur elimin rfe develop 12gene transcriptom score ecscor predict exist ecdna rnaseq ecscor demonstr reliabl predict perform two independ cohort auc 070 valid fluoresc situ hybrid fish cell line clinic sampl next found ecscor emerg independ advers prognost factor across multipl immunotherapi cohort notabl high ecscor correl cell cycl activ immunosuppress character reduc lymphocyt infiltr upregul immunosuppress marker includ mhc molecul coinhibitori immun checkpoint tgfbeta signal gener establish valid 12gene signatur ecscor deriv rnaseq offer novel comput tool predict presenc extrachromosom circular dna stratifi cancer immunotherapi respons
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Persons living with HIV (PLWH) have a higher risk of persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and anal cancer. We evaluated knowledge and awareness of HPV infection and risk factors for anal cancer among PLWH in Puerto Rico (PR). METHODS: Data from a cross-sectional study (2020-2021) were analyzed (n = 212). Inclusion criteria included PLWH, aged >/= 26 years, and living in PR. Telephone interviews collected information on sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics. Two 13-item scales were used to assess knowledge of HPV and anal cancer risk factors; adequate knowledge for both scales were defined as scoring > 70%. Logistic regression models using generalized linear models were used to determine the association between (1) HPV infection awareness, (2) HPV infection knowledge, and (3) anal cancer risk factors knowledge. RESULTS: The median age was 54 years (IQR: 46,58), 67.5% were male, 71.7% reported having an income <$20,000, and 54.2% had an education level of more than high school. HPV awareness was high (82.1%), but only 40.2% and 3.8% had adequate knowledge of HPV and anal cancer risk factors, respectively. In adjusted logistic regression models, men who have sex with men (OR: 1.26, 95%CI: 1.07-1.47) and women (OR: 1.35, 95%CI: 1.15-1.59) aged >/= 50 years had higher odds of HPV awareness than heterosexual men in that age group. Moreover, those with history of anal Pap test aged < 50 years had more HPV awareness (OR 1.34, 95%CI: 1.08-1.66) than their counterparts. Adequate HPV knowledge was higher among participants with an education level of more than high-school (OR:1.28, 95%CI: 1.10-1.50) and with a history of HPV diagnosis (OR:1.33, 95%CI: 1.08-1.65) than their counterparts. In addition, people with good/very good/excellent health perception had higher odds of HPV knowledge (OR:1.23, 95%CI: 1.03-1.47) than those who reported poor/regular health perception. For anal cancer risk factors, those living with HIV for >/= 15 years had increased odds of having adequate knowledge (OR:1.07, 95%CI: 1.02-1.14) than their counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high awareness of HPV, limited knowledge about HPV and anal cancer risk factors was observed among PLWH.

cancer,"BACKGROUND: As a vital endocrine organ, the pancreas exhibits differences in anatomical structure and microenvironment between its head and tail. However, whether there is heterogeneity in miRNA expression within the islet cells of these two regions and what biological significance this heterogeneity may entail remain unclear. METHODS: This study utilized high-throughput sequencing to analyze the miRNA expression profiles in the islet cells from the pancreatic head and tail in rats. The TargetScan and miRDB databases were used to predict target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs). The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases were utilized to analyze the target genes. The key miRNA was verified by qRT-PCR. RESULT: A total of 445 miRNAs were detected in the islet cells of the pancreatic head and tail, among which 69 showed significant differences (|log2 fold change|>0.585 and P<0.05). Compared with the pancreatic tail, 28 miRNAs were upregulated and 41 miRNAs were downregulated in the pancreatic head. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these target genes were significantly enriched in functions such as negative regulation of cellular process, anatomical structure development, intracellular organelle, pancreatic cancer, insulin resistance, MAPK signaling, Wnt signaling, and Hippo signaling. In addition, KEGG analysis of target genes showed that miR-124-3p was in several pathways, such as the insulin signaling pathway, endocrine resistance, small cell lung cancer, and other pathways in cancer. qRT-PCR results showed that miR-124-3p was significantly upregulated in the pancreatic head. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide novel insights into the heterogeneity of miRNA expression in the pancreas and the molecular mechanisms underlying pancreatic cancer, offering potential targets for future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",background vital endocrin organ pancrea exhibit differ anatom structur microenviron head tail howev whether heterogen mirna express within islet cell two region biolog signific heterogen may entail remain unclear method studi util highthroughput sequenc analyz mirna express profil islet cell pancreat head tail rat targetscan mirdb databas use predict target gene differenti express mirna demirna gene ontolog go kyoto encyclopedia gene genom kegg databas util analyz target gene key mirna verifi qrtpcr result total 445 mirna detect islet cell pancreat head tail among 69 show signific differ log2 fold change0585 p005 compar pancreat tail 28 mirna upregul 41 mirna downregul pancreat head bioinformat analysi reveal target gene significantli enrich function neg regul cellular process anatom structur develop intracellular organel pancreat cancer insulin resist mapk signal wnt signal hippo signal addit kegg analysi target gene show mir1243p sever pathway insulin signal pathway endocrin resist small cell lung cancer pathway cancer qrtpcr result show mir1243p significantli upregul pancreat head conclus find provid novel insight heterogen mirna express pancrea molecular mechan underli pancreat cancer offer potenti target futur diagnost therapeut strategi
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer continues to be a major cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the United States. Despite declining mortality rates in recent decades, variations across race, region, urban-rural status, and age remain insufficiently characterized. Therefore, updated evidence is essential to inform effective prevention and control strategies. METHODS: Prostate cancer deaths (ICD-10 code C61) among the U.S. men aged >/= 45 years from 1999 to 2023 were analyzed using the CDC WONDER database. Age-adjusted mortality rate (AAMR) was calculated per 100,000 population and standardized to the 2000 U.S. standard population. Temporal trends were examined using joinpoint regression to estimate annual percent change (APC) and average APC. Subgroup analyses were conducted by region, race, urban-rural status, and age, with additional assessments at the state level. RESULTS: Over the 25-year study period, 749,932 prostate cancer-related deaths were reported. Mortality initially declined but began to rise after 2013, reaching a peak of 33,860 deaths in 2023, reflecting a 'decline followed by rebound' pattern. Importantly, the increase in absolute deaths primarily reflects the effects of population aging. The AAMR decreased significantly overall (AAPC, -2.20%; P < .05), although the pace of decline slowed after 2013. This is likely influenced by changes in Prostate-Specific Antigen screening practices. Regionally, the South consistently exhibited the highest mortality, while the Northeast achieved the largest reduction and the West the smallest decline. By race, non-Hispanic (NH) Black men experienced the sharpest decrease yet continued to face the highest mortality, nearly twice that of NH White men. Mortality remained elevated in nonmetropolitan compared with metropolitan areas, and men aged 75 years and older continued to face the greatest risk. CONCLUSIONS: From 1999 to 2023, prostate cancer mortality among U.S. men aged 45 years and older showed a consistent decline. While the AAMR continued to decrease, the rate of decline slowed after 2013, likely due to changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening practices. In contrast, the observed rise in the absolute number of deaths mainly reflects demographic effects associated with population aging. The greatest burdens were observed among residents of the South, NH Black men, older adults, and rural populations. State-level AAMRs revealed a clear geographic gradient, with consistently higher rates in the South and lower rates in the Northeast. These findings highlight the need for future prevention and control strategies to prioritize high-risk groups through targeted interventions that promote health equity.",background prostat cancer continu major caus cancerrel death among men unit state despit declin mortal rate recent decad variat across race region urbanrur statu age remain insuffici character therefor updat evid essenti inform effect prevent control strategi method prostat cancer death icd10 code c61 among us men age 45 year 1999 2023 analyz use cdc wonder databas ageadjust mortal rate aamr calcul per 100000 popul standard 2000 us standard popul tempor trend examin use joinpoint regress estim annual percent chang apc averag apc subgroup analys conduct region race urbanrur statu age addit assess state level result 25year studi period 749932 prostat cancerrel death report mortal initi declin began rise 2013 reach peak 33860 death 2023 reflect declin follow rebound pattern importantli increas absolut death primarili reflect effect popul age aamr decreas significantli overal aapc 220 p 05 although pace declin slow 2013 like influenc chang prostatespecif antigen screen practic region south consist exhibit highest mortal northeast achiev largest reduct west smallest declin race nonhispan nh black men experienc sharpest decreas yet continu face highest mortal nearli twice nh white men mortal remain elev nonmetropolitan compar metropolitan area men age 75 year older continu face greatest risk conclus 1999 2023 prostat cancer mortal among us men age 45 year older show consist declin aamr continu decreas rate declin slow 2013 like due chang prostatespecif antigen psa screen practic contrast observ rise absolut number death mainli reflect demograph effect associ popul age greatest burden observ among resid south nh black men older adult rural popul statelevel aamr reveal clear geograph gradient consist higher rate south lower rate northeast find highlight need futur prevent control strategi priorit highrisk group target intervent promot health equiti
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Despite advancements in multimodal therapy, glioma remains a lethal brain tumor with limited prognostic biomarkers. Programmed cell death (PCD) pathways and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as therapeutic targets, but their combined prognostic potential in glioma remains underexplored. METHODS: RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) cohorts were analyzed to identify PCD-related lncRNAs. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) Cox regression and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were applied to construct a prognostic signature, with external validation performed in an independent cohort. Tumor immune microenvironment characterization was subsequently conducted through the Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource (TIMER) database using the inverse fold product algorithm, which quantified six tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIIC) subtypes across 10,897 pan-cancer samples. Immune checkpoint differential expression between risk strata was assessed via single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Drug sensitivity prediction was performed using the Cancer Genome Project (GCP) databases. RESULTS: A 4-lncRNA signature effectively stratified patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. The prognosis of the high-risk group is worse. In multivariate analysis, a risk score can independently predict the prognosis and has a robust prediction efficiency in the CGGA external verification set. The infiltration of immunosuppressive cells, such as M2 macrophages, increased the expression of immune checkpoints, such as PD-L1, increased, and the infiltration of CD8 + T cells decreased in high-risk patients. Computational screening identified elesclomol as a potential therapeutic agent showing subtype-specific efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the prognostic significance of lncRNAs associated with PCD in glioma and provides computational evidence for their potential as therapeutic targets. While the results suggest novel avenues for treatment development, they must be interpreted cautiously due to the lack of experimental validation. Future studies should aim to validate these results through controlled clinical trials and explore underlying molecular mechanisms.",background despit advanc multimod therapi glioma remain lethal brain tumor limit prognost biomark program cell death pcd pathway long noncod rna lncrna emerg therapeut target combin prognost potenti glioma remain underexplor method rna sequenc data cancer genom atla tcga chines glioma genom atla cgga cohort analyz identifi pcdrelat lncrna least absolut shrinkag select oper lasso cox regress multivari cox proport hazard regress analys appli construct prognost signatur extern valid perform independ cohort tumor immun microenviron character subsequ conduct tumor immun estim resourc timer databas use invers fold product algorithm quantifi six tumorinfiltr immun cell tiic subtyp across 10897 pancanc sampl immun checkpoint differenti express risk strata assess via singlesampl gene set enrich analysi ssgsea drug sensit predict perform use cancer genom project gcp databas result 4lncrna signatur effect stratifi patient highrisk lowrisk group prognosi highrisk group wors multivari analysi risk score independ predict prognosi robust predict effici cgga extern verif set infiltr immunosuppress cell m2 macrophag increas express immun checkpoint pdl1 increas infiltr cd8 cell decreas highrisk patient comput screen identifi elesclomol potenti therapeut agent show subtypespecif efficaci conclus studi highlight prognost signific lncrna associ pcd glioma provid comput evid potenti therapeut target result suggest novel avenu treatment develop must interpret cautious due lack experiment valid futur studi aim valid result control clinic trial explor underli molecular mechan
cancer,"CONTEXT: Aging individuals are more likely to experience multiple health issues, resulting in increased and complex healthcare needs, particularly at the end-of-life (EoL). While several studies have shown that healthcare costs rose substantially during the final year and months of life, there is limited research on the EoL utilization and cost in Quebec, specifically using population-based data that span multiple healthcare settings and different causes of death. OBJECTIVE: To examine healthcare and social care utilization and cost during the last year of life of people who died in Quebec at the age of 66 and over, according to their cause of death. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective quantitative longitudinal study to analyze individuals' healthcare utilization and cost during their last year of life between 2014 and 2018. Individuals were retrieved from the death registry and classified according to their cause of death as: cancer, organ failure, frailty (physical or cognitive) and other or unknown. Healthcare and social care utilization included: medical visits, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, homecare and long-term care (LTC). Costs were attributed to services either directly from administrative databases or estimated from public financial reports. We used generalized linear models (GLMs) to assess variations in service utilization and costs: Poisson or negative binomial models were employed for count outcomes based on data dispersion, and Gamma log link for costs. RESULTS: The cohort included 21,255 individuals (52.6% women) with ~ 40% of deaths occurring among individuals aged 80-89 years. Nearly 50% of the cohort died from an organ failure, 30% of cancer and 15% of frailty. Cancer and organ failure were associated with high acute care use and costs, while frailty led to greater use of LTC and social care. Overall, the EoL the individual average cost was 34,467$ ($25,000-$53,000), depending on cause of death and type of services used. Notably, social services cost exceeds healthcare cost, especially for people who died from frailty, highlighting the financial burden of LTC accommodation. CONCLUSION: This study highlights distinct EoL healthcare and social services utilization and related costs among older adults, depending on the cause of death, age, and sex. These findings underscore the need for tailored care strategies that reflect different EoL trajectories.",context age individu like experi multipl health issu result increas complex healthcar need particularli endoflif eol sever studi shown healthcar cost rose substanti final year month life limit research eol util cost quebec specif use populationbas data span multipl healthcar set differ caus death object examin healthcar social care util cost last year life peopl die quebec age 66 accord caus death method conduct retrospect quantit longitudin studi analyz individu healthcar util cost last year life 2014 2018 individu retriev death registri classifi accord caus death cancer organ failur frailti physic cognit unknown healthcar social care util includ medic visit emerg depart visit hospit homecar longterm care ltc cost attribut servic either directli administr databas estim public financi report use gener linear model glm assess variat servic util cost poisson neg binomi model employ count outcom base data dispers gamma log link cost result cohort includ 21255 individu 526 women 40 death occur among individu age 8089 year nearli 50 cohort die organ failur 30 cancer 15 frailti cancer organ failur associ high acut care use cost frailti led greater use ltc social care overal eol individu averag cost 34467 2500053000 depend caus death type servic use notabl social servic cost exce healthcar cost especi peopl die frailti highlight financi burden ltc accommod conclus studi highlight distinct eol healthcar social servic util relat cost among older adult depend caus death age sex find underscor need tailor care strategi reflect differ eol trajectori
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Affordable HPV vaccines are needed to accelerate elimination of cervical cancer. We evaluated the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a recombinant bivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine composed of L1 virus-like particles (VLPs) for HPV 16 and HPV18 (HPV-2), produced in Pichia pastoris, in healthy Chinese women aged 18-30 years. METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 10 centres in China (Nov 2014-Jan 2020), participants were assigned 1:1 to receive three doses of HPV-2 or placebo at months 0, 2, and 6. The primary endpoint was efficacy against histopathology-confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher (CIN2+) associated with HPV16/18 through 48 months. Secondary endpoints were safety (adverse events [AEs] within 1 month of any dose; serious AEs throughout follow-up) and immunogenicity (neutralising antibody titres and seroconversion at Month 7 in a predefined subset). RESULTS: Of 12,000 women enrolled, 11,999 received the first dose and 11,281 completed all three doses. Over 48 months, 17 CIN2 + cases occurred: 3 among vaccine recipients (n = 5190) versus 14 among placebo recipients (n = 5167), corresponding to vaccine efficacy of 78.6% (95% CI 23.3-96.1; p = 0.012). No vaccine-related serious AEs occurred. Solicited local AEs were mainly mild pain, reported by 25.9% of vaccinees and 7.9% of placebo recipients. Fever was the most common systemic AE (27.4% vs. 26.4%). In the immunogenicity subset, 99.7% (349/350) and 99.4% (348/350) of vaccinees were seropositive for HPV16 and HPV18 neutralising antibodies, respectively, at Month 7. CONCLUSIONS: Three doses of HPV-2 were well tolerated, highly immunogenic, and efficacious against CIN2 + up to 4 years post-vaccination, supporting further evaluation in the adolescent target population for HPV vaccination campaigns.

cancer,"High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is a highly fatal disease with frequent recurrence and high mortality rates, despite ongoing treatment advancements. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an experimental technique used to obtain extensive genetic information, making it a key component of precision medicine. We conducted a study based on a sample of 108 patients with HGSOC retrospectively selected from Severance Hospital and Gangnam Severance Hospital. We aimed to identify the genetic alterations associated with HGSOC recurrence and survival using deep targeted sequencing. Somatic mutations in NF1, FAT1, ROS1, NOTCH3, and BLM are more common in recurrent ovarian cancer. Differences in copy number variations (CNVs) and gene fusion events were also observed. Using multivariable stepwise logistic regression, we found that the presence of exonic mutations in the NF1 and ROS1 genes and a tumor mutational burden (TMB) value >/= 10 were significantly associated with recurrence in HGSOC patients. High TMB (TMB >/= 10), Del 13q14.3 mutation, and exonic mutations in NOTCH3, NF1, ROS1, ATM, FAT1, and SLX4 genes were associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS), while the ARID1A gene was observed to be associated with overall survival. This study identified key genetic alterations associated with recurrence and survival in HGSOC and confirmed that specific genetic mutations were linked to disease prognosis. We expect that these findings will contribute to more precise prognosis prediction and the development of personalized therapeutic strategies for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.

cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Despite strong evidence supporting universal psychosocial risk screening in pediatric cancer implementation remains inconsistent. Factors at organizational, provider, and patient/family levels impact implementation. Potential differing perspectives regarding risk screening among multidisciplinary providers may influence uptake. This study describes perceived barriers and facilitators in implementing the Psychosocial Assessment Tool (PAT), a psychosocial risk screener and examines differences by discipline. METHODS: One hundred seventeen healthcare providers (HCPs) representing medical, social work, and psychology from 18 pediatric cancer programs completed two scales from PAT Implementation Questionnaire (PIQ). Item scores (1-4 scale) were ranked and differences tested by discipline. RESULTS: Barriers were perceived as ""minor"" and facilitators as ""significant"" and overall PIQ scale scores did not differ by discipline. PIQ-B had a significantly lower mean score (M = 2.03) than PIQ-F (M = 3.08), p < 0.001). Barriers and facilitators rated most impactful (highest mean scores) were: Barriers: ""Language barriers/cultural considerations"" (M = 2.37) and ""Integrating results in EHR"" (M = 2.26); and Facilitators: ""Promotes psychosocial care for all families"" (M = 3.31) and ""Promotes positive psychosocial outcomes"" (M = 3.25). Significant differences were found in the rank ordering of barriers and facilitators by discipline, between social workers and psychologists, with the former noting time constraints associated with screening. CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary HCPs generally agree on the benefits and challenges in implementation of screening with the PAT. Subtle variations in perceived impact of barriers and facilitators between social workers and psychologists highlight the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and communication to facilitate implementation.",object despit strong evid support univers psychosoci risk screen pediatr cancer implement remain inconsist factor organiz provid patientfamili level impact implement potenti differ perspect regard risk screen among multidisciplinari provid may influenc uptak studi describ perceiv barrier facilit implement psychosoci assess tool pat psychosoci risk screener examin differ disciplin method one hundr seventeen healthcar provid hcp repres medic social work psycholog 18 pediatr cancer program complet two scale pat implement questionnair piq item score 14 scale rank differ test disciplin result barrier perceiv minor facilit signific overal piq scale score differ disciplin piqb significantli lower mean score 203 piqf 308 p 0001 barrier facilit rate impact highest mean score barrier languag barrierscultur consider 237 integr result ehr 226 facilit promot psychosoci care famili 331 promot posit psychosoci outcom 325 signific differ found rank order barrier facilit disciplin social worker psychologist former note time constraint associ screen conclus multidisciplinari hcp gener agre benefit challeng implement screen pat subtl variat perceiv impact barrier facilit social worker psychologist highlight import interdisciplinari collabor commun facilit implement
cancer,"Metastatic cancer cells, originating from cancer stem cells with metastatic capacity, utilize nutrient flexibility to navigate the challenges of the metastatic cascade. However, the nutrient required to maintain the stemness potentials of metastatic cancer cells remains unclear. Here, we reveal that metastatic breast cancer cells sustain stemness and initiate metastasis upon detachment by taking up and oxidizing lactate. In detached metastasizing breast cancer cells, lactate is incorporated into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, boosting oxidative phosphorylation, and promoting the stemness potentials via alpha-KG-DNMT3B-mediated SOX2 hypomethylation. Moreover, lactate is taken up and oxidized in mitochondria by the CD147/MCT1/LDHB complex, which correlates with stemness potentials and tumor metastasis in patients with breast cancer. An intracellularly expressed single-chain variable fragment targeting mitochondrial CD147 (mito-CD147 scFv) effectively disrupts the mitochondrial CD147/MCT1/LDHB complex, inhibits lactate-induced stemness potential, depletes circulating breast cancer cells, and reduces metastatic burden, suggesting promising clinical applications in reducing lactate-fueled metastasis.",metastat cancer cell origin cancer stem cell metastat capac util nutrient flexibl navig challeng metastat cascad howev nutrient requir maintain stem potenti metastat cancer cell remain unclear reveal metastat breast cancer cell sustain stem initi metastasi upon detach take oxid lactat detach metastas breast cancer cell lactat incorpor tricarboxyl acid cycl boost oxid phosphoryl promot stem potenti via alphakgdnmt3bmedi sox2 hypomethyl moreov lactat taken oxid mitochondria cd147mct1ldhb complex correl stem potenti tumor metastasi patient breast cancer intracellularli express singlechain variabl fragment target mitochondri cd147 mitocd147 scfv effect disrupt mitochondri cd147mct1ldhb complex inhibit lactateinduc stem potenti deplet circul breast cancer cell reduc metastat burden suggest promis clinic applic reduc lactatefuel metastasi
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Patients with intermediate risk thyroid cancer face the decision of whether or not to undergo radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment after total thyroidectomy. This process is challenging due to the unclear risks and benefits of RAI treatment for intermediate risk disease. The study identified the decisional needs of patients offered RAI treatment for thyroid cancer to inform the development of a web-based patient decision aid (PtDA). METHOD: We used purposive sampling to recruit 23 adult patients with thyroid cancer (M(age) = 39.1; 83% female) from three metropolitan hospitals who were offered RAI treatment. Participants completed an online survey before taking part in one of four 2-h focus groups moderated by a clinical psychologist. Semi-structured interviews explored patients' experiences, decisional needs, and recommended elements for a PtDA. Two raters independently coded transcripts and used content analysis to analyze qualitative data.  RESULTS: Content analysis revealed three broad domains: (1) the range of patient involvement in the RAI treatment decision-making process, (2) personal values-based decisional outcomes, and (3) decision aid content recommendations on the basis of patients' knowledge gaps about RAI treatment. Patients' recommendations included the need for information on the RAI dose and common side effects, risk stratification, safety precautions for radioactivity, low-iodine diet guidance, and financial costs. CONCLUSION: The study provides patient insights for a targeted web-based PtDA that integrates personal values, risk information, and logistical considerations to support informed decision-making about RAI treatment.

cancer,"Radioligand-antibody conjugates (RadioBodies), also known as radiolabeled antibodies, represent an emerging class that enables targeted delivery of radionuclides to tumor cells using antibodies. Conventional antibodies (full-length antibodies) and nonconventional antibodies (antibody fragments) are ideal agents for targeted delivery of radionuclides to tumor sites, owing to their high affinity and specificity. Antibody guides the radionuclide to a precise target, where it participates in killing of cancer cells (therapy) or helps with imaging (diagnosis). RadioBodies are yet to be effectively employed in cancer theranostics but have the potential for the same. Conventional antibodies have long circulatory half-lives, a feature that limits their application in diagnosis but is desirable for therapy. Using nonconventional antibodies (antibody fragments) offers the advantages of small size and removal of the Fc function, which reduces the serum half-life. In recent years, advances in antibody engineering, chelator chemistry and radionuclide technology have greatly facilitated the development of RadioBodies for desired applications. In this review, we discuss the roles of antibodies, chelators, and radionuclides in the clinical development of RadioBodies for cancer theranostics.",radioligandantibodi conjug radiobodi also known radiolabel antibodi repres emerg class enabl target deliveri radionuclid tumor cell use antibodi convent antibodi fulllength antibodi nonconvent antibodi antibodi fragment ideal agent target deliveri radionuclid tumor site owe high affin specif antibodi guid radionuclid precis target particip kill cancer cell therapi help imag diagnosi radiobodi yet effect employ cancer theranost potenti convent antibodi long circulatori halfliv featur limit applic diagnosi desir therapi use nonconvent antibodi antibodi fragment offer advantag small size remov fc function reduc serum halflif recent year advanc antibodi engin chelat chemistri radionuclid technolog greatli facilit develop radiobodi desir applic review discuss role antibodi chelat radionuclid clinic develop radiobodi cancer theranost
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Secondary lymphedema is a common complication after breast cancer treatment. Traditional diagnostic techniques often lack objectivity, are prone to operator bias, and show limited reproducibility. There is a need for diagnostic methods that are reliable, noninvasive, and suitable for monitoring disease progression. This study (German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS-ID: DRKS00027366) aimed to evaluate hyperspectral imaging as a tool for detecting and classifying secondary lymphedema. METHODS: We conducted a prospective multicenter study including 58 women with unilateral secondary lymphedema. Lymphedema severity was categorized according to the International Society of Lymphology. Each participant underwent conventional assessments, including limb circumference measurements, two-point discrimination tests, joint mobility evaluation, and ultrasound imaging of skin and subcutaneous tissue, plus gave patient-reported outcomes. Hyperspectral images were collected using the TIVITA Tissue system, which captures light reflectance from 500 to 1000 nanometers. From these data, the lipid-to-water ratio and the TIVITA tissue water index were calculated to evaluate tissue changes related to lymphedema. RESULTS: Here, we show that conventional methods correlate moderately with lymphedema stage, with ultrasound measurements of skin and subcutaneous thickness showing the strongest associations. Hyperspectral imaging shows strong correlations, with interlimb differences in lipid-to-water ratio and tissue water index outperforming conventional methods. These measurements highlight clear fluid accumulation in the affected limbs. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperspectral imaging provides reproducible, objective, and noninvasive assessment of secondary lymphedema. These findings support its potential as a diagnostic and monitoring tool to improve staging and treatment evaluation.",background secondari lymphedema common complic breast cancer treatment tradit diagnost techniqu often lack object prone oper bia show limit reproduc need diagnost method reliabl noninvas suitabl monitor diseas progress studi german clinic trial regist drksid drks00027366 aim evalu hyperspectr imag tool detect classifi secondari lymphedema method conduct prospect multicent studi includ 58 women unilater secondari lymphedema lymphedema sever categor accord intern societi lympholog particip underw convent assess includ limb circumfer measur twopoint discrimin test joint mobil evalu ultrasound imag skin subcutan tissu plu gave patientreport outcom hyperspectr imag collect use tivita tissu system captur light reflect 500 1000 nanomet data lipidtowat ratio tivita tissu water index calcul evalu tissu chang relat lymphedema result show convent method correl moder lymphedema stage ultrasound measur skin subcutan thick show strongest associ hyperspectr imag show strong correl interlimb differ lipidtowat ratio tissu water index outperform convent method measur highlight clear fluid accumul affect limb conclus hyperspectr imag provid reproduc object noninvas assess secondari lymphedema find support potenti diagnost monitor tool improv stage treatment evalu
cancer,"BACKGROUND: The role of exercise in modulating the immune system and cytokines has garnered increasing attention, particularly in the context of breast cancer survivorship. Breast cancer and its treatments often lead to immunosuppression, which can heighten the risk of infections and recurrence. Emerging evidence suggests that various forms of exercise, including aerobic and resistance exercise, can positively influence cytokine profiles in breast cancer patients. However, the specific effects and underlying mechanisms remain underexplored. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to conduct a systematic review of the studies focused on the effects of exercise on cytokine profiles of breast cancer survivors. METHODS: The databases of Cochrane Library, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science were searched until 31 December 2024, following PRISMA guidelines. Randomized controlled trials were included if they compared breast cancer survivors participating in a structured exercise program with a non-exercise control group and measured cytokine variables both before and after the intervention. The quality of the included studies was rated with the PEDro scale. RESULTS: Eleven studies with 481 individuals undergoing exercise interventions were included in the analysis and compared to 240 individuals as controls. Participants in these studies ranged in age from early 40s to late 50s. These studies examined the effects of various exercise interventions, including resistance exercise (n = 2), aerobic exercise (n = 2), concurrent aerobic + resistance exercise (n = 5), tai chi (n = 1), and yoga (n = 1). The training period ranged from 8 to 52 weeks, with most studies lasting 12-15 weeks. The average frequency of training was three sessions per week with a mean session duration of 55 min. The quality of the studies showed a mean PEDro score of 6.5 +/- 0.9 points (range 5-8 points). Both aerobic and resistance training alone or in combination impacted several immune indices, including decreases in serum concentrations of interleukin-15 (IL-15), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), TNF-alpha expression in NK and NKT cells (NKTNF-alpha, and NKTTNF-alpha), and lower IL-10/TNF-alpha ratio. Other less habitual exercise interventions such as tai chi and yoga also induced positive effects on immune indices. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer survivors enrolled in several forms of exercise training showed improved cytokine parameters compared with counterparts who did not perform exercise. The benefits of exercise training on cytokine profiles of breast cancer survivors were evident with both aerobic and resistance training, whether performed separately or in combination, and with other training regimens such as tai chi and yoga.",background role exercis modul immun system cytokin garner increas attent particularli context breast cancer survivorship breast cancer treatment often lead immunosuppress heighten risk infect recurr emerg evid suggest variou form exercis includ aerob resist exercis posit influenc cytokin profil breast cancer patient howev specif effect underli mechan remain underexplor object aim conduct systemat review studi focus effect exercis cytokin profil breast cancer survivor method databas cochran librari pubm scienc direct scopu sportdiscu web scienc search 31 decemb 2024 follow prisma guidelin random control trial includ compar breast cancer survivor particip structur exercis program nonexercis control group measur cytokin variabl intervent qualiti includ studi rate pedro scale result eleven studi 481 individu undergo exercis intervent includ analysi compar 240 individu control particip studi rang age earli 40 late 50 studi examin effect variou exercis intervent includ resist exercis n 2 aerob exercis n 2 concurr aerob resist exercis n 5 tai chi n 1 yoga n 1 train period rang 8 52 week studi last 1215 week averag frequenc train three session per week mean session durat 55 min qualiti studi show mean pedro score 65 09 point rang 58 point aerob resist train alon combin impact sever immun indic includ decreas serum concentr interleukin15 il15 macrophag migrat inhibitori factor mif tnfalpha express nk nkt cell nktnfalpha nkttnfalpha lower il10tnfalpha ratio less habitu exercis intervent tai chi yoga also induc posit effect immun indic conclus breast cancer survivor enrol sever form exercis train show improv cytokin paramet compar counterpart perform exercis benefit exercis train cytokin profil breast cancer survivor evid aerob resist train whether perform separ combin train regimen tai chi yoga
cancer,"PARG plays an important role in cancer progression and immunoresponse, but its role in breast cancer is not yet fully elucidated. The advanced breast cancer is still a persistent challenge in clinical oncology. Despite the encouraging progress made in cancer immunotherapy, its efficacy is still limited by tumor malignancy and the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Through comprehensive proteomic analysis employing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we identified ITCH-a HECT-family E3 ubiquitin ligase-as a novel interaction partner of PARG. Co-immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays revealed that the PARG inhibition markedly enhances the PARylation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH. This triggers its autoubiquitination-dependent activation, after which activated ITCH catalyzes the ubiquitination of the oncoprotein metadherin (MTDH). This ultimately leads to MTDH's proteasomal degradation and the consequent suppression of tumor growth. Importantly, RNA immunoprecipitation analysis further demonstrated that PARGi-induced ITCH/MTDH potentiates the MHC-I antigen presentation machinery in tumor cells, which correlates with increased infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes within the tumor microenvironment. In invivo validation, combinatorial therapy using the selective PARG inhibitor COH34 with anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade demonstrated synergistic therapeutic efficacy in a murine breast cancer model. To the best of our knowledge, PARG inhibition plays an important role in limiting cancer progression and potentiating immune response, depending on its regulatory function in PARylation and ubiquitination in breast cancer.",parg play import role cancer progress immunorespons role breast cancer yet fulli elucid advanc breast cancer still persist challeng clinic oncolog despit encourag progress made cancer immunotherapi efficaci still limit tumor malign immunosuppress microenviron comprehens proteom analysi employ liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometri identifi itcha hectfamili e3 ubiquitin ligasea novel interact partner parg coimmunoprecipit ubiquitin assay reveal parg inhibit markedli enhanc paryl e3 ubiquitin ligas itch trigger autoubiquitinationdepend activ activ itch catalyz ubiquitin oncoprotein metadherin mtdh ultim lead mtdh proteasom degrad consequ suppress tumor growth importantli rna immunoprecipit analysi demonstr pargiinduc itchmtdh potenti mhci antigen present machineri tumor cell correl increas infiltr cytotox lymphocyt within tumor microenviron invivo valid combinatori therapi use select parg inhibitor coh34 antipdl1 immun checkpoint blockad demonstr synergist therapeut efficaci murin breast cancer model best knowledg parg inhibit play import role limit cancer progress potenti immun respons depend regulatori function paryl ubiquitin breast cancer
cancer,"PURPOSE: Mandibular fractures (MF) are among the most common facial injuries, with significant implications for patient function and quality of life. There is a lack of comprehensive, multi-institutional studies examining short term outcomes and predictors of early complications after treatment of mandibular fractures. METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (ACS-NSQIP) was queried for the time period 2008 through 2021 to identify patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of MF. We extracted data on comorbidities, preoperative blood values, and 30-day postoperative outcomes regarding the occurrence of complications. RESULTS: A total of n = 2,705 patients (443 females; 2,262 males) with an average age of 35 years and a mean BMI of 25.4 kg/m(2) were analyzed. The most common fracture locations were the mandibular body (42%), angle (22%), and symphysis (16%). Complications occurred in 9.4% of cases, with reoperations and readmissions being the most common general complications. Multivariate analysis revealed site-specific risk profiles: condylar and symphyseal fractures showed higher complication rates, while subcondylar fractures had lower rates. Patients undergoing ORIF without placement in mandibulomaxillary fixation (MMF) had a higher rate of surgical complications. Smoking, weight loss, disseminated cancer history, and higher wound class were independently associated with increased risk of complications. CONCLUSION: A 30-day postoperative complication rate of nearly 10% emphasizes the need for robust risk stratification and targeted strategies to further improve surgical safety in this challenging patient population. Site-specific risk variations, particularly for symphyseal and condylar fractures, and the higher rate of complication in patients without MMF, underscore the importance of tailored procedural planning. Moreover, identifying smoking and inpatient care as independent risk factors underscores the value of addressing modifiable risks and optimizing care for high-risk patients to improve surgical outcomes.",purpos mandibular fractur mf among common facial injuri signific implic patient function qualiti life lack comprehens multiinstitut studi examin short term outcom predictor earli complic treatment mandibular fractur method american colleg surgeon nation surgic qualiti improv program databas acsnsqip queri time period 2008 2021 identifi patient underw open reduct intern fixat orif mf extract data comorbid preoper blood valu 30day postop outcom regard occurr complic result total n 2705 patient 443 femal 2262 male averag age 35 year mean bmi 254 kgm2 analyz common fractur locat mandibular bodi 42 angl 22 symphysi 16 complic occur 94 case reoper readmiss common gener complic multivari analysi reveal sitespecif risk profil condylar symphys fractur show higher complic rate subcondylar fractur lower rate patient undergo orif without placement mandibulomaxillari fixat mmf higher rate surgic complic smoke weight loss dissemin cancer histori higher wound class independ associ increas risk complic conclus 30day postop complic rate nearli 10 emphas need robust risk stratif target strategi improv surgic safeti challeng patient popul sitespecif risk variat particularli symphys condylar fractur higher rate complic patient without mmf underscor import tailor procedur plan moreov identifi smoke inpati care independ risk factor underscor valu address modifi risk optim care highrisk patient improv surgic outcom
cancer,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a key biomarker associated with breast cancer, and its reliable detection using effective diagnostic tools is clinically significant. Here, we developed an electrochemical aptasensor based on an electroactive labeling strategy for the detection of HER2 using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). A nickel nanofoam/gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)/silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) nanocomposite was employed as a novel electrode modifier synthesized via a simple, low-cost, and reproducible method. In this design, AuNPs enabled stable aptamer immobilization, while AgNPs acted as electroactive labels, enhancing the current response through a synergistic effect that could not be achieved with either nanoparticle alone. The newly developed aptasensor demonstrated high sensitivity and good reproducibility for HER2 detection. The aptasensor showed a wide linear range of 0.001-100 ng mL(-1), a very low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.30 pg mL(-1), and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1.0 pg mL(-1), indicating its significant potential for clinical diagnostic applications.",human epiderm growth factor receptor 2 her2 key biomark associ breast cancer reliabl detect use effect diagnost tool clinic signific develop electrochem aptasensor base electroact label strategi detect her2 use differenti puls voltammetri dpv nickel nanofoamgold nanoparticl aunpssilv nanoparticl agnp nanocomposit employ novel electrod modifi synthes via simpl lowcost reproduc method design aunp enabl stabl aptam immobil agnp act electroact label enhanc current respons synergist effect could achiev either nanoparticl alon newli develop aptasensor demonstr high sensit good reproduc her2 detect aptasensor show wide linear rang 0001100 ng ml1 low limit detect lod 030 pg ml1 limit quantif loq 10 pg ml1 indic signific potenti clinic diagnost applic
cancer,"Two key challenges in translating messenger RNA-based lipid nanoparticle (mRNA-LNP) cancer vaccines to clinical use are limited mRNA expression and unavoidable inflammatory responses. Here we develop a membrane-destabilizing zwitterionic ionizable lipid that enhances mRNA expression by promoting endosomal escape while reducing inflammatory reactogenicity. This lipid features a pyridine-based carboxybetaine (PyCB) zwitterionic headgroup, biodegradable multitailed alkyl chains and a tertiary amine linker. The PyCB headgroup forms a zwitterionic PyCB-water complex that protonates to a positively charged state below pH 6.8. This allows for good biocompatibility at physiological pH and strong protonation in endosomes, enabling earlier and more efficient mRNA release when synergistic with the tertiary amine and the tail moiety. Incorporating membrane-destabilizing zwitterionic lipids into the LNP formulation used in a commercially available mRNA vaccine significantly boosts mRNA expression in antigen-presenting cells within lymph nodes, enhancing cytotoxic T cell activation. In addition, these membrane-destabilizing zwitterionic lipid-containing nanoparticles show reduced inflammation and neutrophil infiltration at the injection site due to their zwitterionic property. These lipids are also compatible with existing targeted nanoparticle formulations, further improving mRNA delivery.",two key challeng translat messeng rnabas lipid nanoparticl mrnalnp cancer vaccin clinic use limit mrna express unavoid inflammatori respons develop membranedestabil zwitterion ioniz lipid enhanc mrna express promot endosom escap reduc inflammatori reactogen lipid featur pyridinebas carboxybetain pycb zwitterion headgroup biodegrad multitail alkyl chain tertiari amin linker pycb headgroup form zwitterion pycbwat complex proton posit charg state ph 68 allow good biocompat physiolog ph strong proton endosom enabl earlier effici mrna releas synergist tertiari amin tail moieti incorpor membranedestabil zwitterion lipid lnp formul use commerci avail mrna vaccin significantli boost mrna express antigenpres cell within lymph node enhanc cytotox cell activ addit membranedestabil zwitterion lipidcontain nanoparticl show reduc inflamm neutrophil infiltr inject site due zwitterion properti lipid also compat exist target nanoparticl formul improv mrna deliveri
cancer,"PURPOSE: This study evaluated the safety and preliminary efficacy of zolbetuximab plus chemotherapy in patients with claudin 18 isoform 2 (CLDN18.2)-positive advanced gastric cancer (AGC). METHODS: This single-institutional retrospective study enrolled patients with HER2-negative CLDN18.2-positive AGC who were treated with zolbetuximab plus chemotherapy between July 2024 and August 2025. RESULTS: The cohort included 50 patients with a median age of 63 years (range 30-83; 44% male). The primary tumor location was the stomach in 86% of the patients. Meanwhile, 26% of the patients underwent prior gastrectomy. The PD-L1 combined positive score was < 5 in 87% of patients. Among 24 patients with measurable lesions at baseline, the objective response and disease control rates were 66.7% and 87.5%, respectively. After median follow-up of 7.3 months, median progression-free survival and the duration of response were 6.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.3-10.7] and 6.7 months (95% CI 4.7-10.2), respectively. Grade >/= 3 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 62% of the patients, most commonly hypoalbuminemia (22%), neutrophil count decreased (22%) and anorexia (12%). Subsequent treatment was received by 83% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Zolbetuximab plus chemotherapy was administered to real-world patients with CLDN18.2-positive AGC with acceptable safety profiles and showed preliminary antitumor efficacy.

cancer,"Pancreatic and Esophageal cancers are highly aggressive with high mortality and limited treatment, causing over 466,000 and 544,100 deaths worldwide in 2020 respectively. This highlights the urgent need for safer,and effective anticancer agents. Catalpol, a natural iridoid glycoside, shows anticancer potential, but due to its poor drug-like properties it requires structural modification. This study investigates pyrazole-modified catalpol derivatives as dual inhibitors for these cancers using Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) modelling, molecular docking, and pharmacokinetic studies. We analyzed fourteen pyrazole-modified catalpol derivatives with reported IC50values against four cancer cell lines(BxPC-3, PANC-1, Eca109, and EC9706). The molecules were optimized using DensityFunctional Theory (DFT), and 2D molecular descriptors were calculated using PaDEL. QSAR models were developed by utilizing a Genetic Function Algorithm (GFA) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and validated using statistical metrics such as R(2), Q(2), R(2)adj, and R(2)pred. Docking studies targeted VEGFR-2 and BRAF V600E kinases using AutoDockVina, while ADMET and drug-likeness properties were predicted using SwissADME and pkCSM tools. The external validation R(2)pred values for BxPC-3, PANC-1, Eca109, and EC9706 cell lines were 0.9412, 0.9535, 0.9981, and 0.9935, respectively. Among the derivatives, compound 3k showed the highest binding affinity for VEGFR-2 (- 8.18 kcal/mol) and BRAF (- 8.64 kcal/mol), surpassing the control drugs etoposide (- 8.00 kcal/mol) and dabrafenib (- 8.15 kcal/mol) respectively. ADMET analysis confirmed good intestinal absorption, limited blood-brain barrier penetration, non-toxicity, acceptable total clearance, and compliance with Lipinski's rule. Overall, the study suggests that pyrazole-modified catalpol derivatives, especially compound 3k, are promising multi-target inhibitors for pancreatic and esophageal cancers, justify further in-vitro and in-vivo studies.",pancreat esophag cancer highli aggress high mortal limit treatment caus 466000 544100 death worldwid 2020 respect highlight urgent need saferand effect anticanc agent catalpol natur iridoid glycosid show anticanc potenti due poor druglik properti requir structur modif studi investig pyrazolemodifi catalpol deriv dual inhibitor cancer use quantit structur activ relationship qsar model molecular dock pharmacokinet studi analyz fourteen pyrazolemodifi catalpol deriv report ic50valu four cancer cell linesbxpc3 panc1 eca109 ec9706 molecul optim use densityfunct theori dft 2d molecular descriptor calcul use padel qsar model develop util genet function algorithm gfa multipl linear regress mlr valid use statist metric r2 q2 r2adj r2pred dock studi target vegfr2 braf v600e kinas use autodockvina admet druglik properti predict use swissadm pkcsm tool extern valid r2pred valu bxpc3 panc1 eca109 ec9706 cell line 09412 09535 09981 09935 respect among deriv compound 3k show highest bind affin vegfr2 818 kcalmol braf 864 kcalmol surpass control drug etoposid 800 kcalmol dabrafenib 815 kcalmol respect admet analysi confirm good intestin absorpt limit bloodbrain barrier penetr nontox accept total clearanc complianc lipinski rule overal studi suggest pyrazolemodifi catalpol deriv especi compound 3k promis multitarget inhibitor pancreat esophag cancer justifi invitro invivo studi
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is projected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2040, with the highest disease burden expected amongst Non-Hispanic Black patients. One of the most significant predictors of poor outcomes is the presence of cancer-associated cachexia (CCa). Yet, race- and ethnicity-specific biomarkers for early CCa diagnosis are lacking. METHODS: We evaluated a panel of candidate biomarkers of CCa in a diverse cohort of patients with pre-treatment serum using multiplex ELISA-based methods. RESULTS: We find that growth/differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is associated with cachexia severity, is superior to standard biomarkers at classifying cachexia, and differentiates between non-cachexia and pre-cachexia status, but only among Hispanic/Latinx and non-Hispanic White participants. Furthermore, high GDF-15 levels at diagnosis are associated with a greater weight loss from 3.3% (95%CI = -0.14-6.7) to 8.0% (CI = 5.9-10.1) over the 6 months post-diagnosis. Finally, both ENA-78/CXCL5 and GRO-alpha/CXCL1 are elevated in non-Hispanic Black individuals in a disease-independent manner (P < 0.001 for both analytes). CONCLUSIONS: GDF-15 may be a potential biomarker for ""pre-cachexia"" in the non-Hispanic White and the Hispanic population, but not non-Hispanic Black individuals. These findings underscore the unmet need to enroll non-Hispanic Black participants in clinical trials for CCa.",background pancreat ductal adenocarcinoma project becom second lead caus cancerrel death 2040 highest diseas burden expect amongst nonhispan black patient one signific predictor poor outcom presenc cancerassoci cachexia cca yet race ethnicityspecif biomark earli cca diagnosi lack method evalu panel candid biomark cca divers cohort patient pretreat serum use multiplex elisabas method result find growthdifferenti factor15 gdf15 associ cachexia sever superior standard biomark classifi cachexia differenti noncachexia precachexia statu among hispaniclatinx nonhispan white particip furthermor high gdf15 level diagnosi associ greater weight loss 33 95ci 01467 80 ci 59101 6 month postdiagnosi final ena78cxcl5 groalphacxcl1 elev nonhispan black individu diseaseindepend manner p 0001 analyt conclus gdf15 may potenti biomark precachexia nonhispan white hispan popul nonhispan black individu find underscor unmet need enrol nonhispan black particip clinic trial cca
cancer,"BACKGROUND: The EAES released guidelines on the role of taTME in the management of rectal cancer in 2022. OBJECTIVE: To develop updated, evidence-informed recommendations to support clinicians involved in the management of taTME; to provide guidance for hospital managers, policymakers, and patients with low- and mid-rectal cancers. METHODS: We performed a systematic review to identify randomized trials and matched nonrandomized studies comparing transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) to laparoscopic TME (laTME) or robotic TME (roTME) in patients with low- and mid-rectal cancer. A panel of general and colorectal surgeons, a radiologist, a pathologist, and patient partners appraised the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. The panel developed recommendations using an evidence-to-decision framework during an in-person consensus meeting. We applied a Delphi survey to establish consensus. RESULTS: The panel recommends taTME over laTME in patients with low- and selected mid-rectal cancers when access to surgeons with expertise in performing taTME in high-volume rectal cancer centers is available (strong recommendation). This recommendation applies to patients eligible for sphincter preservation who are at high risk for conversion to abdominoperineal resection, including male gender with BMI > 30 kg/m(2). The recommendation is supported by a reduction in 30-day major complications and disease recurrence at 2 years with taTME compared to laTME. When access to a surgeon with expertise in performing taTME is not available, the panel recommends against taTME over laTME (strong recommendation). Further, the panel suggests roTME as an alternative to taTME in patients with low- and selected mid-rectal cancers when access to surgeons with expertise in performing taTME is not available (conditional recommendation). CONCLUSION: We provide evidence-informed guidance on the role of taTME in the surgical management of patients with low- and mid-rectal cancers. Patients and surgeons should exercise shared-decision making to apply patient-tailored decisions when considering treatment options.",background eae releas guidelin role tatm manag rectal cancer 2022 object develop updat evidenceinform recommend support clinician involv manag tatm provid guidanc hospit manag policymak patient low midrect cancer method perform systemat review identifi random trial match nonrandom studi compar transan total mesorect excis tatm laparoscop tme latm robot tme rotm patient low midrect cancer panel gener colorect surgeon radiologist pathologist patient partner apprais certainti evid use grade panel develop recommend use evidencetodecis framework inperson consensu meet appli delphi survey establish consensu result panel recommend tatm latm patient low select midrect cancer access surgeon expertis perform tatm highvolum rectal cancer center avail strong recommend recommend appli patient elig sphincter preserv high risk convers abdominoperin resect includ male gender bmi 30 kgm2 recommend support reduct 30day major complic diseas recurr 2 year tatm compar latm access surgeon expertis perform tatm avail panel recommend tatm latm strong recommend panel suggest rotm altern tatm patient low select midrect cancer access surgeon expertis perform tatm avail condit recommend conclus provid evidenceinform guidanc role tatm surgic manag patient low midrect cancer patient surgeon exercis shareddecis make appli patienttailor decis consid treatment option
cancer,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Lung cancer screening has historically been associated with false-positive results that can lead to complications and increased costs. LungFlag is a machine-learning risk prediction model using individual-level data to identify people at high risk of developing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), prompting healthcare professionals to consider appropriate actions such as recommended screening with low-dose computed tomography. This study evaluated the budget impact of using the LungFlag risk prediction model to identify candidates for lung cancer screening from a US payer perspective. METHODS: This budget impact model estimated total annual costs with or without LungFlag for a hypothetical 1 million-member US commercial health plan. Incremental costs were evaluated over a 5-year period with a cycle length of 1 year; no discounting was applied. All costs were adjusted to 2021 US dollars. The population included screening-naive individuals aged 50-80 years with a >/=20-pack-years smoking history who were either current smokers or former smokers who had quit smoking in the previous 15 years (US Preventive Services Task Force 2021 criteria). LungFlag performance was measured 9-12 months before clinical diagnosis. Sensitivity and scenario analyses explored the robustness of base-case assumptions. RESULTS: The budget impact model showed that LungFlag was associated with a total cumulative cost savings of US$2.8 million over 5 years, largely attributable to reduced advanced NSCLC treatment costs (-$4.4 million) as more patients were identified with early stage I rather than stage III/IV disease. Using LungFlag, an estimated 17 additional NSCLC diagnoses were identified, 22 fewer NSCLC-related deaths occurred over 5 years, 50 more patients had stage I NSCLC at diagnosis, and 33 fewer patients had stage III or IV NSCLC at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Using LungFlag to identify candidates for lung cancer screening was estimated to save US$2.8 million over 5 years from a US commercial health plan perspective, largely attributable to reduced costs of treating advanced NSCLC.",backgroundobject lung cancer screen histor associ falseposit result lead complic increas cost lungflag machinelearn risk predict model use individuallevel data identifi peopl high risk develop nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc prompt healthcar profession consid appropri action recommend screen lowdos comput tomographi studi evalu budget impact use lungflag risk predict model identifi candid lung cancer screen us payer perspect method budget impact model estim total annual cost without lungflag hypothet 1 millionmemb us commerci health plan increment cost evalu 5year period cycl length 1 year discount appli cost adjust 2021 us dollar popul includ screeningna individu age 5080 year 20packyear smoke histori either current smoker former smoker quit smoke previou 15 year us prevent servic task forc 2021 criteria lungflag perform measur 912 month clinic diagnosi sensit scenario analys explor robust basecas assumpt result budget impact model show lungflag associ total cumul cost save us28 million 5 year larg attribut reduc advanc nsclc treatment cost 44 million patient identifi earli stage rather stage iiiiv diseas use lungflag estim 17 addit nsclc diagnos identifi 22 fewer nsclcrelat death occur 5 year 50 patient stage nsclc diagnosi 33 fewer patient stage iii iv nsclc diagnosi conclus use lungflag identifi candid lung cancer screen estim save us28 million 5 year us commerci health plan perspect larg attribut reduc cost treat advanc nsclc

We sought to compare bracketed lumpectomy with RFID tag with wire localization with regards to margin status and local recurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a single center retrospective study of patients undergoing bracketed lumpectomy for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive breast cancer with RFID tag or wire localization between January 2018 and July 2024. Bracketing distance, total lumpectomy volume, margin status, and oncologic outcomes were compared. RESULTS: A total of 496 patients underwent bracketed lumpectomy, including 164 with RFID localization and 332 with wire localization, with a median follow-up of 33 months. The median bracketed distance between localization devices was similar between the wire localization group (30.4 mm(3)) and the RFID group (32.3 mm(3), p = 0.181). Median lumpectomy volume was smaller in the wire group (84 cm(3)) compared with the RFID group (107 cm(3), p = 0.004). Positive margin rates were not significantly different between the wire localization compared to the RFID tag group (p = 0.546). Total, local, and distant recurrence rates were comparable between the wire (4.2, 2.7, and 0.9%) and then RFID tag groups (4.3%, [p = 1.000], 3.0%, [p = 1.000], and 1.2%, [p = 0.667], respectively.

cancer,"T cell exhaustion has been implicated in cancer and infectious diseases. In this study, we report a novel mouse model, ""MolT-II"", with T cells expressing a transgenic T cell receptor (TCR) specific for a Moloney virus envelope-derived, MHC class II-presented peptide epitope. Characterization of MolT-II CD4 T cells revealed that they are dysfunctional, showing severely impaired effector functions, reduced proliferation and increased baseline expression of co-inhibitory receptors such as PD-1, LAG-3 and CTLA-4, likely due to chronic exposure to a self-antigen. We further show that epitope-specific peptide vaccination combined with immune checkpoint blockade is able to restore the function of MolT-II CD4 T cells in vivo, associated with enhanced tumor control in mice. The MolT-II mouse strain thus represents an in vivo model for reversible CD4 T cell dysfunction, allowing the study of the role of CD4 T cell regulation in cancer, mechanisms underlying CD4 T cell dysfunction and exhaustion, and novel immunomodulatory therapies aiming to rescue dysfunctional T cells.",cell exhaust implic cancer infecti diseas studi report novel mous model moltii cell express transgen cell receptor tcr specif moloney viru envelopederiv mhc class iipres peptid epitop character moltii cd4 cell reveal dysfunct show sever impair effector function reduc prolifer increas baselin express coinhibitori receptor pd1 lag3 ctla4 like due chronic exposur selfantigen show epitopespecif peptid vaccin combin immun checkpoint blockad abl restor function moltii cd4 cell vivo associ enhanc tumor control mice moltii mous strain thu repres vivo model revers cd4 cell dysfunct allow studi role cd4 cell regul cancer mechan underli cd4 cell dysfunct exhaust novel immunomodulatori therapi aim rescu dysfunct cell
cancer,"Store-operated Ca(2)(+) entry (SOCE) is a major pathway for Ca(2)(+) entry that regulates several cellular functions. SOCE remodeling mediated by changes in the expression and/or function of the Orai channels results in the reorganization of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis leading to a variety of pathologies, including cancer. Notably, a significant alteration of Orai function has been reported in breast cancer cells, where the dysregulation of the Notch1 signaling pathway plays a role in the development and progression of cancer hallmarks. Here, we have investigated the possible role of Notch1 in the regulation of the expression of Orai1 and Orai3 in different breast cancer cell lines. Expression of the active form of Notch1, as well as cell stimulation with the Notch1 agonist Jagged-1 (Jag-1), demonstrates a differential role of Notch1 in the regulation of Orai expression in non-tumoral breast epithelial cells and triple negative or luminal breast cancer cells. The role of Notch1 was confirmed using DAPT, a gamma-secretase inhibitor that prevents activation of the Notch pathway. Modulation of Orai1 and Orai3 expression by Notch1 was paralleled by changes in SOCE. The effect in Orai expression mediated by activation of Notch1 signaling pathway was mimicked by the expression of HEY1 or the non-phosphorylatable HEY1-S68A mutant; by contrast, expression of the phosphomimetic HEY1-S68D mutant was without effect on Orai expression. Understanding the Notch1-HEY1-Orai axis might provide insights into the development of subtype-specific therapeutic strategies targeting breast cancer.",storeoper ca2 entri soce major pathway ca2 entri regul sever cellular function soce remodel mediat chang express andor function orai channel result reorgan intracellular ca2 homeostasi lead varieti patholog includ cancer notabl signific alter orai function report breast cancer cell dysregul notch1 signal pathway play role develop progress cancer hallmark investig possibl role notch1 regul express orai1 orai3 differ breast cancer cell line express activ form notch1 well cell stimul notch1 agonist jagged1 jag1 demonstr differenti role notch1 regul orai express nontumor breast epitheli cell tripl neg lumin breast cancer cell role notch1 confirm use dapt gammasecretas inhibitor prevent activ notch pathway modul orai1 orai3 express notch1 parallel chang soce effect orai express mediat activ notch1 signal pathway mimick express hey1 nonphosphorylat hey1s68a mutant contrast express phosphomimet hey1s68d mutant without effect orai express understand notch1hey1orai axi might provid insight develop subtypespecif therapeut strategi target breast cancer
cancer,"PURPOSE: This study employed cross-lagged panel network (CLPN) analysis to construct a symptom network for colorectal cancer patients at four time points during the perioperative period, aiming to identify predictive relationships and intervention opportunities. METHODS: A total of 315 patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery were enrolled in this study. They were assessed at four time points: preoperatively at admission (T0), and postoperatively on day 1 (T1), day 3 (T2), and on the day of discharge (T3). Symptom severity was evaluated using the MD Anderson Symptom Scale and the colorectal cancer module. Cross-sectional networks were analyzed using Gaussian graphical models (GGM), while CLPN models with LASSO regularization examined directed temporal relationships between symptoms, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: The analysis revealed dynamic changes in core symptoms: vomiting (T0-EI = 1.090), distress (T1/T2-EI > 1.021), and altered bowel habits (T3-EI = 0.461). Overall network strength significantly decreased from T2 to T3 (p < 0.001). In the T0-T1 band, sadness at admission (OEI = 0.684) predicted vomiting (edge weight = 0.297), low mood (0.183), and dry mouth (0.088) on postoperative day 1; in the T1-T2 band, low mood at T1 (OEI = 0.651) predicted altered stool characteristics (0.502) and constipation (0.370) at T2. Vomiting and altered stool characteristics showed incoming predictability of 0.41 and 0.45, respectively.

cancer,"T cells are central components of the adaptive immune system and play key roles in antitumor and antiviral responses. The diverse cell fates of T cells enable them to respond to different durations and strengths of antigen stimulation and various cytokine milieus in a context-dependent manner. During acute infection or vaccination, T cells differentiate into effector cells and later develop into memory cells after antigen clearance, which mediate immune protection against the same antigen. In contrast, during cancer and chronic infection, T cells fail to enter the canonical effector or memory cell differentiation path. Instead, antigen-specific T cells enter a dysfunctional, partially responsive state called exhaustion. Exhausted T cells are heterogeneous. A subset of exhausted T cells exhibits stem cell-like properties. These stem-like T cells sustain immunity through self-renewal and repopulation of terminally differentiated progenies. Stem-like properties are critical for T cell immunity induced by immunotherapy. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling the exhaustion and stemness of T cells and explores the potential of rewiring these circuits to increase the efficiency of T-cell-based immunotherapy.",cell central compon adapt immun system play key role antitumor antivir respons divers cell fate cell enabl respond differ durat strength antigen stimul variou cytokin milieu contextdepend manner acut infect vaccin cell differenti effector cell later develop memori cell antigen clearanc mediat immun protect antigen contrast cancer chronic infect cell fail enter canon effector memori cell differenti path instead antigenspecif cell enter dysfunct partial respons state call exhaust exhaust cell heterogen subset exhaust cell exhibit stem celllik properti stemlik cell sustain immun selfrenew repopul termin differenti progeni stemlik properti critic cell immun induc immunotherapi review summar recent advanc understand molecular mechan control exhaust stem cell explor potenti rewir circuit increas effici tcellbas immunotherapi
cancer,"Tumor-derived exosome secretion dynamically correlates with malignant progression, although the mechanisms by which tumor-associated antigens regulate exosome production remain unclear. Here, we found that the number of plasma exosomes increased significantly with the progression of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and identified that CD147 as a crucial mediator of exosome secretion using mass spectrometry. CD147 exhibited a positive correlation with exosomes release in NSCLC patients and various cell lines and it drove the release of exosome to promote tumor metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptomic profiling of transgenic CD147 models identified differential gene expression patterns enriched in autophagy-related pathways. Intriguingly, CD147 was found to specifically enhance autophagosome and amphisome biogenesis to promote exosomes release by using transmission electron microscopy, high-sensitivity structured light microscope, RFP-GFP-LC3 adenovirus reporters and immunofluorescence, which indicated the role of CD147 in mediating non-canonical autophagy processes. Mechanistically, CD147 activated the GCN2/EIF2alpha/ATG12 signaling axis to drive autophagosome assembly but blocked autolysosome maturation by inhibiting VAMP8/STX17/SNAP29-dependent fusion, leading to amphisome accumulation. Proteomics identified TRIM56 as a novel E3 ligase mediating K619 ubiquitination-dependent GCN2 proteasomal degradation. Subsequently, we found that CD147 suppresses TRIM56 expression, thereby stabilizing GCN2 to activate the GCN2/EIF2alpha/ATG12 axis. Meanwhile, CD147-induced IP3R3-mediated calcium overload facilitated the fusion of autophagosomes with multivesicular bodies to form amphisomes, thus enhancing exosome release. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel mechanism whereby CD147 promotes crinophagy-mediated exosome secretion through dual regulation of GCN2 stability and calcium homeostasis, thereby accelerating NSCLC progression. Our work establishes a new molecular link between autophagy modulation and cancer progression.",tumorderiv exosom secret dynam correl malign progress although mechan tumorassoci antigen regul exosom product remain unclear found number plasma exosom increas significantli progress nonsmallcel lung cancer nsclc patient identifi cd147 crucial mediat exosom secret use mass spectrometri cd147 exhibit posit correl exosom releas nsclc patient variou cell line drove releas exosom promot tumor metastasi vitro vivo transcriptom profil transgen cd147 model identifi differenti gene express pattern enrich autophagyrel pathway intriguingli cd147 found specif enhanc autophagosom amphisom biogenesi promot exosom releas use transmiss electron microscopi highsensit structur light microscop rfpgfplc3 adenoviru report immunofluoresc indic role cd147 mediat noncanon autophagi process mechanist cd147 activ gcn2eif2alphaatg12 signal axi drive autophagosom assembl block autolysosom matur inhibit vamp8stx17snap29depend fusion lead amphisom accumul proteom identifi trim56 novel e3 ligas mediat k619 ubiquitinationdepend gcn2 proteasom degrad subsequ found cd147 suppress trim56 express therebi stabil gcn2 activ gcn2eif2alphaatg12 axi meanwhil cd147induc ip3r3medi calcium overload facilit fusion autophagosom multivesicular bodi form amphisom thu enhanc exosom releas collect find reveal novel mechan wherebi cd147 promot crinophagymedi exosom secret dual regul gcn2 stabil calcium homeostasi therebi acceler nsclc progress work establish new molecular link autophagi modul cancer progress
cancer,"Malignant ovarian germ cell tumors (MOGCT) and ovarian sex cord stromal tumors (SCST) are rare ovarian tumors. Since 2013, all German federal states are obliged to record data on diagnosis, pathology, therapy, and clinical course of tumor diseases. We gathered data on MOGCT and SCST from thirteen federal cancer registries and the German Childhood Cancer Registry. Each of the participating registries provided aggregated data on MOGCT and SCST with date of diagnosis between 01.01.2016 and 31.12.2021. 629 MOGCT and 872 SCST were included, age peaks at diagnosis for MOGCT and SCST were between 20 and 24 years and between 55 and 59 years, respectively. Of all MOGCT, 23%, 22%, 13% and 12% were malignant teratoma, dysgerminoma, neuroendocrine tumors and yolk sac tumors, respectively. The large majority (94%) of SCST represented malignant granulosa cell tumors. Most tumors were diagnosed in FIGO stage I (66% of MOGCT and 85% of SCST). Surgery was reported in 58% of patients with MOGCT and in 73% of patients with SCST. Chemotherapy was administered to 26% of MOGCT patients and 8% of SCST patients. This study highlights the great potential of cancer registries as high numbers of patients are recorded, however, data are highly dependent on the reporting institutions.",malign ovarian germ cell tumor mogct ovarian sex cord stromal tumor scst rare ovarian tumor sinc 2013 german feder state oblig record data diagnosi patholog therapi clinic cours tumor diseas gather data mogct scst thirteen feder cancer registri german childhood cancer registri particip registri provid aggreg data mogct scst date diagnosi 01012016 31122021 629 mogct 872 scst includ age peak diagnosi mogct scst 20 24 year 55 59 year respect mogct 23 22 13 12 malign teratoma dysgerminoma neuroendocrin tumor yolk sac tumor respect larg major 94 scst repres malign granulosa cell tumor tumor diagnos figo stage 66 mogct 85 scst surgeri report 58 patient mogct 73 patient scst chemotherapi administ 26 mogct patient 8 scst patient studi highlight great potenti cancer registri high number patient record howev data highli depend report institut
cancer,"Early cancer diagnosis relies heavily on finding appropriate materials to recognize relevant biomarkers. In this study, we conduct a first-principle density functional theory simulation to investigate the capability of two-dimensional polyaniline (g-C(3)N) for detecting propane and acetaldehyde, as known lung cancer biomarkers. The energetically most favorable configurations of the adsorbed systems were determined, and the computed adsorption energy reveals the non-covalent interaction between biomarkers and g-C(3)N monolayer. As a result, the adsorption process is reversible, which is fundamental for the long lifespan of biosensors in real applications. On the other hand, acetaldehyde physisorption on the g-C(3)N monolayer induces a significant variation in the band gap, suggesting the possible use of g-C(3)N as a resistance-based biosensor. Charge transfer analysis shows that both biomarkers act as electron acceptors from the host material. The capability of the g-C(3)N monolayer to respond to these biomarkers was also investigated upon applying an external electric field. An electric field considerably enhances the interaction between gas molecules and the g-C(3)N monolayer by increasing the adsorption energies and charge transfer values, which are more pronounced for acetaldehyde. The results also show that the g-C(3)N monolayer energy band gap in the presence of biomarkers closes at high electric fields. These findings highlight the ability to adjust the sensing properties of the g-C(3)N monolayer through an external electric field without requiring any structural modifications.",earli cancer diagnosi reli heavili find appropri materi recogn relev biomark studi conduct firstprincipl densiti function theori simul investig capabl twodimension polyanilin gc3n detect propan acetaldehyd known lung cancer biomark energet favor configur adsorb system determin comput adsorpt energi reveal noncoval interact biomark gc3n monolay result adsorpt process revers fundament long lifespan biosensor real applic hand acetaldehyd physisorpt gc3n monolay induc signific variat band gap suggest possibl use gc3n resistancebas biosensor charg transfer analysi show biomark act electron acceptor host materi capabl gc3n monolay respond biomark also investig upon appli extern electr field electr field consider enhanc interact ga molecul gc3n monolay increas adsorpt energi charg transfer valu pronounc acetaldehyd result also show gc3n monolay energi band gap presenc biomark close high electr field find highlight abil adjust sens properti gc3n monolay extern electr field without requir structur modif
cancer,"Bispecific T-cell Engagers (BITEs) are a novel form of immunotherapy that overcome a deficiency of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) by targeting a preidentified tumor associated antigen and redirecting a polyclonal population of effector T-cells against the tumor. High grade serous ovarian cancer is a lethal disease in the recurrent setting and has not been amenable to ICI therapy. MUC16/CA125 is overexpressed in high grade serous ovarian cancer. BITEs targeting the tumor-retained portion of MUC16/CA125 have recently been described and are in early-phase clinical trials. To identify mechanisms of resistance to BITEs, we collected serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and ascites samples from patients with disease progression on MUC16-directed bispecific antibodies. Analysis of these samples showed downregulation of MUC16/CA125, elevated secretion of VEGF, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in tumor cells. Interestingly, hypoxia was determined to be a driver of these changes. These findings were prospectively validated in ovarian cancer cell lines with CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of MUC16/CA125 and VEGF. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with disease progression were capable of effective cytolysis ex vivo, suggesting that resistance to therapy was primarily tumor driven. Restoration of MUC16/CA125 expression did not restore cytotoxicity in the presence of increased VEGF secretion. Combination treatment with a VEGF inhibitor rescued cytotoxicity in hypoxia-conditioned ovarian cancer cell lines with preserved target antigen expression. Collectively, these data outline a link between hypoxia and the development of resistance to BITEs and posits inhibition of VEGF inhibition as a potentially important therapeutic intervention.",bispecif tcell engag bite novel form immunotherapi overcom defici immun checkpoint inhibitor ici target preidentifi tumor associ antigen redirect polyclon popul effector tcell tumor high grade serou ovarian cancer lethal diseas recurr set amen ici therapi muc16ca125 overexpress high grade serou ovarian cancer bite target tumorretain portion muc16ca125 recent describ earlyphas clinic trial identifi mechan resist bite collect serum peripher blood mononuclear cell ascit sampl patient diseas progress muc16direct bispecif antibodi analysi sampl show downregul muc16ca125 elev secret vegf epithelialtomesenchym transit tumor cell interestingli hypoxia determin driver chang find prospect valid ovarian cancer cell line crisprcas9 knockout muc16ca125 vegf peripher blood mononuclear cell patient diseas progress capabl effect cytolysi ex vivo suggest resist therapi primarili tumor driven restor muc16ca125 express restor cytotox presenc increas vegf secret combin treatment vegf inhibitor rescu cytotox hypoxiacondit ovarian cancer cell line preserv target antigen express collect data outlin link hypoxia develop resist bite posit inhibit vegf inhibit potenti import therapeut intervent
cancer,"A virus-derived serpin, Serp-1, has proven efficacy in treating inflammatory and coagulation disorders in preclinical and clinical studies. Serp-1 evolved over millions of years to block host immune responses, targeting serine proteases in immune and coagulation pathways. Treatment with PEGylated Serp-1 (PEGSerp-1) protein reduced lung injury in both lupus lung hemorrhage and SARS-CoV-2 models. Here, PEGSerp-1 effects on immune-coagulopathic responses is examined in a mouse colitis model. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with life-threatening complications with severe inflammation, bleeding, vasculitis, cancer and toxic megacolon. Serine protease cascades activate coagulation and complement pathways throughout the human body and are regulated by inhibitors, termed serpins, that can reduce gut inflammation. Prophylactic PEGSerp-1 significantly improved survival in severe 5% Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis, reducing inflammation and crypt damage. Colon damage and inflammation were also reduced after either acute colitis induced by 5% DSS or repeat 2% DSS induced colitis. PEGSerp-1 reduced inflammatory M1 macrophage invasion, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), fibrinogen and complement on immunohistochemical analysis. PEGSerp-1 reduced uPAR expression in human macrophage, but not colon cells.

cancer,"With improvements in childhood cancer survival, attention has shifted toward health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and long-term treatment effects. This study aimed to validate the Hungarian version of the Minneapolis-Manchester Quality of Life Instrument - Adolescent Form (MMQL-AF) and explore factors associated with HRQoL among adolescents and young people with cancer. Ninety-two patients with cancer (46 receiving active treatment and 46 >/= 1 year post-treatment) and 46 healthy controls completed the MMQL-AF. The MMQL-AF was translated into Hungarian in accordance with Beaton et al. and TARES (2024) guidelines. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). Validity was evaluated by correlations with the Hungarian Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL 4.0) and by comparing scores across groups. Five items were removed during confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to improve model fit. The MMQL-AF demonstrated acceptable reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.73-0.90; ICC 0.78-0.96; RMSEA = 0.062; 90% CI: 0.055-0.069; CFI = 0.828; TLI = 0.814; SRMR = 0.079; GFI = 0.962) and strong concurrent validity with PedsQL scores. Cancer patients reported significantly lower HRQoL than healthy peers (mean 3.58 vs. 3.81; mean difference 0.23; 95% CI: 0.05-0.41; p = 0.012). No significant difference emerged between patients on active treatment and patients off treatment. Patients with bone, soft-tissue, or central nervous system tumors reported worse outcomes (p = 0.015). Positive parental relationships were strongly associated with a better outlook (p < 0.001). The Hungarian MMQL-AF demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity for assessing HRQoL among adolescents and young people with cancer. Tumor type and family environment were associated with differences in the well-being of the patients. This instrument enables comprehensive HRQoL assessment in Hungarian pediatric oncology, supporting identification of at-risk groups and informing survivorship care strategies tailored to medical and psychosocial needs.",improv childhood cancer surviv attent shift toward healthrel qualiti life hrqol longterm treatment effect studi aim valid hungarian version minneapolismanchest qualiti life instrument adolesc form mmqlaf explor factor associ hrqol among adolesc young peopl cancer ninetytwo patient cancer 46 receiv activ treatment 46 1 year posttreat 46 healthi control complet mmqlaf mmqlaf translat hungarian accord beaton et al tare 2024 guidelin reliabl assess use cronbach alpha intraclass correl coeffici icc valid evalu correl hungarian pediatr qualiti life inventori pedsql 40 compar score across group five item remov confirmatori factor analysi cfa improv model fit mmqlaf demonstr accept reliabl cronbach alpha 073090 icc 078096 rmsea 0062 90 ci 00550069 cfi 0828 tli 0814 srmr 0079 gfi 0962 strong concurr valid pedsql score cancer patient report significantli lower hrqol healthi peer mean 358 vs 381 mean differ 023 95 ci 005041 p 0012 signific differ emerg patient activ treatment patient treatment patient bone softtissu central nervou system tumor report wors outcom p 0015 posit parent relationship strongli associ better outlook p 0001 hungarian mmqlaf demonstr accept reliabl valid assess hrqol among adolesc young peopl cancer tumor type famili environ associ differ wellb patient instrument enabl comprehens hrqol assess hungarian pediatr oncolog support identif atrisk group inform survivorship care strategi tailor medic psychosoci need
cancer,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is resistant to radiotherapy due to tumor hypoxia and abnormal angiogenesis, necessitating strategies to enhance therapeutic outcomes. This study evaluates the use of minibeam radiation therapy (MBRT), delivered through a novel 3D-printed collimator made of polylactic acid (PLA) and tungsten, to modulate the TNBC microenvironment and potentially overcome radioresistance. Three collimator configurations (400, 600, 800 mum beam widths) were tested. Mice received MBRT (150 Gy) or conventional radiotherapy (CRT, 7 or 15 Gy), with tumor responses assessed using histology, RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. The measured beam FWHM values for the MBRT 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 groups were 419 +/- 23 mum, 575 +/- 31 mum, and 798 +/- 50 mum, respectively, while the CTC distances were 832 +/- 25 mum, 1296 +/- 21 mum, and 1651 +/- 49 mum. MBRT generated stable, spatially fractionated dose distributions with high peak-to-valley ratios. Compared to CRT at equivalent valley doses, MBRT significantly reduced tumor growth, proliferation, and hypoxia while increasing necrosis. Mechanistically, MBRT downregulated HIF-1alpha/VEGFR signaling, alleviating hypoxia and angiogenesis, and enhanced vascular normalization via increased pericyte coverage. These findings suggest MBRT reprograms the TNBC microenvironment, supporting its potential as a radiosensitizing strategy for clinical translation.",tripleneg breast cancer tnbc resist radiotherapi due tumor hypoxia abnorm angiogenesi necessit strategi enhanc therapeut outcom studi evalu use minibeam radiat therapi mbrt deliv novel 3dprint collim made polylact acid pla tungsten modul tnbc microenviron potenti overcom radioresist three collim configur 400 600 800 mum beam width test mice receiv mbrt 150 gy convent radiotherapi crt 7 15 gy tumor respons assess use histolog rna sequenc immunohistochemistri measur beam fwhm valu mbrt 04 06 08 group 419 23 mum 575 31 mum 798 50 mum respect ctc distanc 832 25 mum 1296 21 mum 1651 49 mum mbrt gener stabl spatial fraction dose distribut high peaktovalley ratio compar crt equival valley dose mbrt significantli reduc tumor growth prolifer hypoxia increas necrosi mechanist mbrt downregul hif1alphavegfr signal allevi hypoxia angiogenesi enhanc vascular normal via increas pericyt coverag find suggest mbrt reprogram tnbc microenviron support potenti radiosensit strategi clinic translat
cancer,"Cancer molecular subtype classification is an essential component of precision oncology which provides insights into cancer prognosis and guides targeted therapy. Despite the growing applications of AI for cancer molecular subtype classification, challenges persist due to non-standardized dataset configurations, diverse omics modalities, and inconsistent evaluation measures. These issues limit the comparability, reproducibility, and generalizability of AI classifiers across different cancers and hinder the development of robust and accurate AI-driven tools. This study performs comparative analyses of 35 unique AI classifiers across 153 datasets, covering 8 omics modalities and 20 different cancers. Particularly, it investigates 6 different research questions, and based on comprehensive performance analyses of the 35 AI classifiers it elucidates the research questions with the following answers: (i) out of 17 different configurations for 5 out of the 8 tested omics modalities, RPPA (RPPA), Gistic2-all-data-by-genes (CNV), HM27 (Meth), and HiSeqV2-exon (Exon) configurations consistently yield better performance; (ii) in terms of 8 omics modalities, RNASeq, miRNA, CNV, and Exon generally achieve higher macro-accuracy (MACC) compared to Meth., Array, SNP and RPPA; (iii) SNP and RPPA modalities are prone to biases due to technical noise; (iv) traditional machine learning (ML) models (SVM, XGB, HGB) perform best on small and low-dimensional datasets, while deep learning (DL) models (ResNet18, CNN, NN, MLP) excel on large and high-dimensional datasets; (v) SVM achieves the highest mean MACC across all classifiers, with NN, ResNet18, DEEPGENE, and MLP also demonstrate strong performance; and (vi) DL classifiers show superior MACC as compared to ML classifiers in 12 out of 20 cancers. The findings offer key insights to guide the development of standardized, robust, and efficient AI-driven pipelines for cancer molecular subtype classification. This study enhances reproducibility and facilitates better comparison across AI methods, ultimately advancing precision oncology.",cancer molecular subtyp classif essenti compon precis oncolog provid insight cancer prognosi guid target therapi despit grow applic ai cancer molecular subtyp classif challeng persist due nonstandard dataset configur divers omic modal inconsist evalu measur issu limit compar reproduc generaliz ai classifi across differ cancer hinder develop robust accur aidriven tool studi perform compar analys 35 uniqu ai classifi across 153 dataset cover 8 omic modal 20 differ cancer particularli investig 6 differ research question base comprehens perform analys 35 ai classifi elucid research question follow answer 17 differ configur 5 8 test omic modal rppa rppa gistic2alldatabygen cnv hm27 meth hiseqv2exon exon configur consist yield better perform ii term 8 omic modal rnaseq mirna cnv exon gener achiev higher macroaccuraci macc compar meth array snp rppa iii snp rppa modal prone bias due technic nois iv tradit machin learn ml model svm xgb hgb perform best small lowdimension dataset deep learn dl model resnet18 cnn nn mlp excel larg highdimension dataset v svm achiev highest mean macc across classifi nn resnet18 deepgen mlp also demonstr strong perform vi dl classifi show superior macc compar ml classifi 12 20 cancer find offer key insight guid develop standard robust effici aidriven pipelin cancer molecular subtyp classif studi enhanc reproduc facilit better comparison across ai method ultim advanc precis oncolog
cancer,"Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is associated with improved survival in recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) but carries a high risk of postoperative complications. Accurate perioperative risk stratification remains an unmet need. To develop and internally validate a perioperative risk model for postoperative complications in ROC patients using information available by the end of surgery (pre- and intra-operative data), and to compare logistic regression (LR) and artificial neural networks (ANN) as possible predictive models. A retrospective analysis of 71 patients treated with CRS and HIPEC between 2011 and 2022 was performed. Clinical, surgical, and perioperative variables were analysed. Predictors were restricted to variables available at or before the end of the index operation, which prevents information leakage by using only data available at prediction time. LR and ANN models were developed and assessed with cross-validation. Performance reporting followed TRIPOD (Type b) and TRIPOD + AI, with Brier score, and calibration slope/intercept from out‑of‑fold (OOF) predictions. Thresholded metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC) were summarised at a prespecified probability cut-off. Exploratory univariate odds ratio analyses with Holm-adjusted p-values were used to explore procedure-complication associations. Postoperative complications occurred in 45% of patients. LR identified blood loss (p = 0.005) and number of procedures (p = 0.042) as significant predictors of complications. The LR model achieved an accuracy of 66.2%, precision of 64.3%, recall of 56.2%, F1 score of 60.0%, and AUC of 0.700. The ANN model achieved an accuracy of 97.2%, precision of 94.3%, recall of 100%, F1 score of 97.1%, and AUC of 0.967. Hysterectomy with adnexa (OR = 11.67, p = 0.035) and metastasectomy (OR = 7.42, p = 0.042) were significantly associated with higher postoperative complication rates. ANN demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to LR in identifying postoperative complications after CRS and HIPEC, as indicated by ROC analysis. Combining traditional statistical modelling with modern machine learning may enhance ROC for perioperative risk stratification after CRS with HIPEC. A well-calibrated, interpretable LR model together with a highly discriminative ANN could enable more tailored allocation of intensive care resources and earlier identification of high-risk patients, potentially improving the safety of this demanding but beneficial treatment. However, external multicentre validation is required before clinical implementation.",cytoreduct surgeri cr combin hypertherm intraperiton chemotherapi hipec associ improv surviv recurr ovarian cancer roc carri high risk postop complic accur periop risk stratif remain unmet need develop intern valid periop risk model postop complic roc patient use inform avail end surgeri pre intraop data compar logist regress lr artifici neural network ann possibl predict model retrospect analysi 71 patient treat cr hipec 2011 2022 perform clinic surgic periop variabl analys predictor restrict variabl avail end index oper prevent inform leakag use data avail predict time lr ann model develop assess crossvalid perform report follow tripod type b tripod ai brier score calibr slopeintercept out‑of‑fold oof predict threshold metric accuraci precis recal f1 score area receiv oper characterist curv auc summaris prespecifi probabl cutoff exploratori univari odd ratio analys holmadjust pvalu use explor procedurecompl associ postop complic occur 45 patient lr identifi blood loss p 0005 number procedur p 0042 signific predictor complic lr model achiev accuraci 662 precis 643 recal 562 f1 score 600 auc 0700 ann model achiev accuraci 972 precis 943 recal 100 f1 score 971 auc 0967 hysterectomi adnexa 1167 p 0035 metastasectomi 742 p 0042 significantli associ higher postop complic rate ann demonstr superior predict perform compar lr identifi postop complic cr hipec indic roc analysi combin tradit statist model modern machin learn may enhanc roc periop risk stratif cr hipec wellcalibr interpret lr model togeth highli discrimin ann could enabl tailor alloc intens care resourc earlier identif highrisk patient potenti improv safeti demand benefici treatment howev extern multicentr valid requir clinic implement

cancer,"The standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer (RC) in Japan is TME with or without lateral lymph node dissection (LLND) and subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy. The efficacy of chemotherapy after TME without LLND remains unclear, so we aimed to assess this efficacy. We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent TME without LLND and received adjuvant chemotherapy between January 2010 and December 2020 at our institution. Relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Prognostic factors for RFS, including tumor location, chemotherapy regimen, and T and N factors were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Of 197 patients, 117 were eligible. The median age was 66 years (range 26-82). Tumor locations were Ra and Rb in 67 (57%) and 50 (43%) patients. Eighty (68%) and 37 (32%) patients received fluoropyrimidine monotherapy (single agent) and oxaliplatin-based therapy (doublet) as adjuvant chemotherapy.

cancer,"Quercetin is a naturally occurring flavonoid widely recognized for its potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. However, its clinical application is limited by low water solubility and poor bioavailability. In this study, the complexation of quercetin with iron (II) ions was systematically investigated through electrochemical, spectroscopic, biological, and computational techniques to improve its physicochemical and pharmacological performance. Cyclic voltammetry revealed that quercetin undergoes irreversible oxidation due to semiquinone and para-quinonemethide formation, while Fe(II) exhibited quasi-reversible redox behavior, which became less reversible upon complexation, suggesting altered electron transfer kinetics. The stability constant (log betaMX = 3.29) and the negative Gibbs free energy (DeltaG = - 19.07 kJ/mol) confirmed spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable complex formation. UV-Vis spectroscopy showed significant bathochromic shifts (Deltalambda = 66 nm), and the continuous variation method established a 1:1 metal-to-ligand stoichiometry. (1)H NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction patterns further confirmed the coordination sites and structural modifications upon metal binding. The Fe(II)-quercetin complex demonstrated superior antioxidant capacity in DPPH radical scavenging assays, with an IC(5)(0) of 21.86 microg/mL compared to 23.47 microg/mL for free quercetin, confirming enhanced radical scavenging activity upon complexation. Cytotoxicity assays on HepG2 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines revealed enhanced bioactivity of the complex, with IC(5)(0) values of 26.80 and 18.60 microM, respectively. Antifungal testing showed moderate inhibition against Candida albicans. Molecular docking simulations using the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (PDB: 7JWY) indicated stronger binding affinity for the complex (- 5.42 kcal/mol) than quercetin alone, suggesting potential antiviral efficacy. Additionally, DFT calculations revealed increased softness and electrophilicity of the complex, supporting its enhanced reactivity. Collectively, these findings position the Fe(II)-quercetin complex as a promising multifunctional agent with potential applications in antioxidant therapy, cancer treatment, and antiviral drug development.",quercetin natur occur flavonoid wide recogn potent antioxid antiinflammatori anticanc effect howev clinic applic limit low water solubl poor bioavail studi complex quercetin iron ii ion systemat investig electrochem spectroscop biolog comput techniqu improv physicochem pharmacolog perform cyclic voltammetri reveal quercetin undergo irrevers oxid due semiquinon paraquinonemethid format feii exhibit quasirevers redox behavior becam less revers upon complex suggest alter electron transfer kinet stabil constant log betamx 329 neg gibb free energi deltag 1907 kjmol confirm spontan thermodynam favor complex format uvvi spectroscopi show signific bathochrom shift deltalambda 66 nm continu variat method establish 11 metaltoligand stoichiometri 1h nmr spectroscopi xray diffract pattern confirm coordin site structur modif upon metal bind feiiquercetin complex demonstr superior antioxid capac dpph radic scaveng assay ic50 2186 microgml compar 2347 microgml free quercetin confirm enhanc radic scaveng activ upon complex cytotox assay hepg2 mcf7 cancer cell line reveal enhanc bioactiv complex ic50 valu 2680 1860 microm respect antifung test show moder inhibit candida albican molecular dock simul use sarscov2 spike protein pdb 7jwi indic stronger bind affin complex 542 kcalmol quercetin alon suggest potenti antivir efficaci addit dft calcul reveal increas soft electrophil complex support enhanc reactiv collect find posit feiiquercetin complex promis multifunct agent potenti applic antioxid therapi cancer treatment antivir drug develop
cancer,"Chronic hepatitis B is a serious liver infection, caused by the hepatitis B virus. Chronic hepatitis B further leads for the risk of liver function failure, liver cancer and serious scarring of the liver called cirrhosis. The objective of the current study was to investigate the prevalence of chronic hepatitis b virus infection and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care at Felege Hiwot Comprehensive Specialized Hospital Ethiopia. Institutional based retrospective cross sectional study design was conducted at Felege Hiwot Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. To measure the prevalence of hepatitis B infection in the study area, testing of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was conducted over time. The study was conducted among 221 pregnant women who have attended antenatal care. Systematic random sampling technique was conducted for the selection of participants in the current study. The overall prevalence of hepatitis B virus among pregnant women in the current study was 4.55%. Among 221 pregnant women taken as study participants, 49 of them who had history of medical illness were screened for hepatitis B surface antigen and among these 25 had positive result, yielding a sensitivity (95% confidence interval) of 80% (70 - 88.5) and a specificity of 96.8% (93.7 - 98.4) for Healgen and Determine; 91.6 - 96.5 for Advanced Quality).

cancer,"Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) represents a prevalent endocrine neoplasm. Dysregulated tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (TACSTD2) expression is functionally involved in the progression of multiple cancers. Nonetheless, the biological molecular mechanisms underlying TACSTD2 in PTC remain unclear. To verify the biological function of TACSTD2 in PTC, we conducted loss- and gain-of-function experiments, namely, cell proliferation (Cell Counting Kit-8), EdU incorporation, colony formation, and transwell migration/invasion assays, along with establishing a nude mouse xenograft tumor model. Our findings revealed that TACSTD2 knockout impeded PTC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and reduced tumorigenicity in vivo. In contrast, TACSTD2 overexpression reversed these effects in vitro. Through integrated bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation, TACSTD2 was recognized as a downstream target of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)-modulated N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification. In an m6A-dependent manner, METTL3 reduced TACSTD2 mRNA stability. m6A-mediated degradation of TACSTD2 mRNA was reliant on the m6A reader protein YTHDC2. As evidenced by rescue experiments, TACSTD2 overexpression resulted in a partial restoration of the METTL3-induced tumor-suppressive phenotype. Finally, the METTL3/TACSTD2/YTHDC2 axis was confirmed to be an inhibitor in PTC and activates the TNF signaling to promote cell apoptosis and inhibit the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Collectively, METTL3-modulated m6A modification of TACSTD2 exerts an indispensable tumor-suppressive function in PTC progression. The METTL3/TACSTD2/YTHDC2 axis may serve as a molecular target for PTC therapy.",papillari thyroid cancer ptc repres preval endocrin neoplasm dysregul tumorassoci calcium signal transduc 2 tacstd2 express function involv progress multipl cancer nonetheless biolog molecular mechan underli tacstd2 ptc remain unclear verifi biolog function tacstd2 ptc conduct loss gainoffunct experi name cell prolifer cell count kit8 edu incorpor coloni format transwel migrationinvas assay along establish nude mous xenograft tumor model find reveal tacstd2 knockout imped ptc cell prolifer migrat invas vitro reduc tumorigen vivo contrast tacstd2 overexpress revers effect vitro integr bioinformat analysi experiment valid tacstd2 recogn downstream target methyltransferaselik 3 mettl3modul n6methyladenosin m6a modif m6adepend manner mettl3 reduc tacstd2 mrna stabil m6amedi degrad tacstd2 mrna reliant m6a reader protein ythdc2 evidenc rescu experi tacstd2 overexpress result partial restor mettl3induc tumorsuppress phenotyp final mettl3tacstd2ythdc2 axi confirm inhibitor ptc activ tnf signal promot cell apoptosi inhibit epithelialmesenchym transit collect mettl3modul m6a modif tacstd2 exert indispens tumorsuppress function ptc progress mettl3tacstd2ythdc2 axi may serv molecular target ptc therapi
cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major cause of cancer-related mortality, motivating delivery systems that retain antitumor activity while limiting off-target toxicity. We engineered neutral multilamellar soy-lecithin liposomes co-encapsulating beta-carotene (BC) and doxorubicin (DOX). Thin-film hydration produced vesicles with a DLS Z-average of 122.4 +/- 83.4 nm (PDI = 0.534) and zeta-potential of - 25.6 +/- 8.0 mV, and a TEM diameter of 184 +/- 34 nm, with > 90% entrapment efficiency for both cargos. In HCT-116 cells the formulation preserved DOX potency (IC(5)(0), microg mL(-)(1), mean +/- SD: free DOX 610.9 +/- 11.4; DOX-Lipo 614.0 +/- 1.8; BC-DOX-Lipo 618.9 +/- 5.8) and remained ~ 1.5-fold more active than BC alone (free BC 960.6 +/- 13.6; BC-Lipo 951.8 +/- 18.8). Annexin V/PI flow cytometry showed that BC-DOX-Lipo achieved the highest total apoptosis (44.51 +/- 4.45%) and deep G(0)/G(1) arrest (92.06 +/- 9.2%), reducing S-phase to 6.37 +/- 0.60% (p = 0.0186 vs DOX-Lipo). Alkaline comet analysis indicated that co-delivery modestly attenuated DOX-associated DNA fragmentation (tailed cells 11.43 +/- 0.45% for BC-DOX-Lipo vs 16.27 +/- 0.25% for DOX-Lipo, p < 0.001), consistent with BC's redox buffering. Differential scanning calorimetry and FTIR supported drug-bilayer interactions: BC slightly increased Tm and acyl-chain order, whereas DOX disrupted cooperativity; co-loading shifted T(m) to 37.84  degrees C and broadened the transition, indicating a more fluid bilayer at 37  degrees C. In-silico ADMET profiling (contextual, not in-vivo PK) highlighted superior oral absorption and BBB penetration for BC and negligible oral uptake for DOX; docking predicted higher DOX affinities across Bcl-2, beta-catenin, P-glycoprotein, and topoisomerase II (e.g., - 9.06 to - 9.30 kcal mol(-)(1)) relative to BC ( approximately  - 7.6 to - 7.8 kcal mol(-)(1)). Overall, liposomal co-delivery maintains DOX cytotoxicity while strengthening G(1)/S checkpoint blockade and increasing programmed cell death, with partial moderation of DNA fragmentation. These in-vitro data motivate stability optimization and in-vivo evaluation in CRC models.",colorect cancer crc remain major caus cancerrel mortal motiv deliveri system retain antitumor activ limit offtarget toxic engin neutral multilamellar soylecithin liposom coencapsul betacaroten bc doxorubicin dox thinfilm hydrat produc vesicl dl zaverag 1224 834 nm pdi 0534 zetapotenti 256 80 mv tem diamet 184 34 nm 90 entrap effici cargo hct116 cell formul preserv dox potenc ic50 microg ml1 mean sd free dox 6109 114 doxlipo 6140 18 bcdoxlipo 6189 58 remain 15fold activ bc alon free bc 9606 136 bclipo 9518 188 annexin vpi flow cytometri show bcdoxlipo achiev highest total apoptosi 4451 445 deep g0g1 arrest 9206 92 reduc sphase 637 060 p 00186 vs doxlipo alkalin comet analysi indic codeliveri modestli attenu doxassoci dna fragment tail cell 1143 045 bcdoxlipo vs 1627 025 doxlipo p 0001 consist bc redox buffer differenti scan calorimetri ftir support drugbilay interact bc slightli increas tm acylchain order wherea dox disrupt cooper coload shift tm 3784 degre c broaden transit indic fluid bilay 37 degre c insilico admet profil contextu invivo pk highlight superior oral absorpt bbb penetr bc neglig oral uptak dox dock predict higher dox affin across bcl2 betacatenin pglycoprotein topoisomeras ii eg 906 930 kcal mol1 rel bc approxim 76 78 kcal mol1 overal liposom codeliveri maintain dox cytotox strengthen g1 checkpoint blockad increas program cell death partial moder dna fragment invitro data motiv stabil optim invivo evalu crc model
cancer,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) are known for their anti-inflammatory potential, which includes the macrophage polarization into an anti-inflammatory and tissue remodeling state. GCs are routinely co-administered to cancer patients to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy. However, it is not well known if GCs can modulate tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to promote tumor progression. Here, we show that dexamethasone (DEX) induces dose-dependent differentiation of THP-1 monocyte-derived anti-tumorigenic (M1) macrophages into pro-tumorigenic (M2-like) macrophages, even in the presence of M1 cues, and that DEX can repolarize fully differentiated M1 macrophages into an M2-like state. These macrophages have a cytokine profile similar to the pro-tumorigenic (M2) macrophages and can stimulate the proliferation and invasion of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells in vitro. DEX treatment of an orthotopic mouse model of TNBC attenuated paclitaxel-mediated tumor growth inhibition, increased M2-like TAMs in primary tumors, and enhanced lung metastasis. Transcriptomic analysis of DEX-treated M1 macrophages revealed not only transcriptomic overlap with M2 macrophages, but also with human breast cancer TAM transcriptomic data, and further to a specific TAM signature associated with aggressive estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer. Our study illustrates a remarkable macrophage repolarization plasticity upon DEX exposure that can promote tumorigenesis, warranting care in prescribing high doses of GCs to breast cancer patients, especially to those considered for chemotherapy.",glucocorticoid gc known antiinflammatori potenti includ macrophag polar antiinflammatori tissu remodel state gc routin coadminist cancer patient allevi side effect chemotherapi howev well known gc modul tumorassoci macrophag tam promot tumor progress show dexamethason dex induc dosedepend differenti thp1 monocytederiv antitumorigen m1 macrophag protumorigen m2like macrophag even presenc m1 cue dex repolar fulli differenti m1 macrophag m2like state macrophag cytokin profil similar protumorigen m2 macrophag stimul prolifer invas tripleneg breast cancer tnbc cell vitro dex treatment orthotop mous model tnbc attenu paclitaxelmedi tumor growth inhibit increas m2like tam primari tumor enhanc lung metastasi transcriptom analysi dextreat m1 macrophag reveal transcriptom overlap m2 macrophag also human breast cancer tam transcriptom data specif tam signatur associ aggress estrogen receptorneg breast cancer studi illustr remark macrophag repolar plastic upon dex exposur promot tumorigenesi warrant care prescrib high dose gc breast cancer patient especi consid chemotherapi
cancer,"Cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) is a transmembrane glycoprotein implicated in tumor progression and metastasis, while phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) plays central role in MAPK pathway-driven oncogenic signaling. We investigated the expression and clinical relevance of CD44 in colorectal cancer (CRC) and explored its synergistic interaction with p-ERK1/2 in predicting metastatic risk. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD44 and p-ERK1/2 was performed in tissue microarray from 1,137 primary CRC cases. Associations with clinicopathological parameters and survival outcomes were analyzed using Chi-square tests, Kaplan-Meier curves and logistic regression models. CD44 was over expressed in 47.7% (542/1,137) cases and was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.0042), stage III disease (p = 0.0045), high-grade tumors (p = 0.0111), deficient mismatch repair status (p = 0.0007), high Ki-67 (p = 0.0051) and p-ERK1/2 expressions (p = 0.0012). However, CD44 alone did not predict survival outcomes (overall survival and disease-free survival). Co-expression of CD44 and p-ERK1/2 was observed in 284 cases (25.3%) and was significantly associated with stage III/IV disease (p = 0.0022), lymph node involvement (p = 0.0117) and metachronous distant metastasis (p = 0.0404). Co-expression emerged as an independent predictor of distant metastasis in multivariate analysis (Odds ratio = 1.73; 95% confidence interval = 1.11-2.69; p = 0.0149). CD44 and p-ERK1/2 co-expression defines a high-risk subset of CRC patients with increased metastatic potential. These findings highlight a clinically relevant biomarker axis that may aid in prognostic stratification and future therapeutic targeting.",cluster differenti 44 cd44 transmembran glycoprotein implic tumor progress metastasi phosphoryl erk12 perk12 play central role mapk pathwaydriven oncogen signal investig express clinic relev cd44 colorect cancer crc explor synergist interact perk12 predict metastat risk immunohistochemistri ihc cd44 perk12 perform tissu microarray 1137 primari crc case associ clinicopatholog paramet surviv outcom analyz use chisquar test kaplanmei curv logist regress model cd44 express 477 5421137 case significantli associ lymph node metastasi p 00042 stage iii diseas p 00045 highgrad tumor p 00111 defici mismatch repair statu p 00007 high ki67 p 00051 perk12 express p 00012 howev cd44 alon predict surviv outcom overal surviv diseasefre surviv coexpress cd44 perk12 observ 284 case 253 significantli associ stage iiiiv diseas p 00022 lymph node involv p 00117 metachron distant metastasi p 00404 coexpress emerg independ predictor distant metastasi multivari analysi odd ratio 173 95 confid interv 111269 p 00149 cd44 perk12 coexpress defin highrisk subset crc patient increas metastat potenti find highlight clinic relev biomark axi may aid prognost stratif futur therapeut target
cancer,"Inflammation, acute activity, intestinal metaplasia, and atrophy are key indicators in gastric biopsy evaluations, with their grading being crucial for assessing gastric cancer progression. However, diagnostic subjectivity among pathologists and the complex interrelationships between these indicators present significant challenges. Additionally, the high resolution of whole slide images (WSIs) complicates large-scale annotation efforts. To address these issues, we propose a multi-task learning model utilizing self-supervised pre-trained weights from extensive pathological datasets. The model integrates four indicators-severity of inflammation, atrophy, acute activity, and intestinal metaplasia-training on WSIs to predict these indicators while accounting for their interrelationships. Our results show that multi-task learning outperforms single-task models, achieving higher accuracy across all indicators. This model can thus serve as an auxiliary tool for evaluating non-tumor gastric diseases and supporting diagnosis.",inflamm acut activ intestin metaplasia atrophi key indic gastric biopsi evalu grade crucial assess gastric cancer progress howev diagnost subject among pathologist complex interrelationship indic present signific challeng addit high resolut whole slide imag wsi complic largescal annot effort address issu propos multitask learn model util selfsupervis pretrain weight extens patholog dataset model integr four indicatorssever inflamm atrophi acut activ intestin metaplasiatrain wsi predict indic account interrelationship result show multitask learn outperform singletask model achiev higher accuraci across indic model thu serv auxiliari tool evalu nontumor gastric diseas support diagnosi
cancer,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) arising in the setting of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare type of kidney cancer and features VHL germline mutation. This type of ccRCC is rarely characterised at the single-cell level. In this work, whole-exome sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) were conducted on one ccRCC sample with VHL disease. Integrating scRNA-seq and whole-exome sequencing data by the Seurat package, we determined the relationship between single-cell transcriptome features and gene mutations. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were performed on one VHL germline mutation ccRCC and six non-VHL germline mutation ccRCC samples. We revealed the gene expression characteristics of ccRCC with VHL germline mutation. The frameshift mutations in OBP2A and BCR1, and the elevated expression of COX7A1 were most specific characteristics of ccRCC tumor cells with VHL mutation. And the extensive infiltration of exhausted T cells was the characteristic of tumor microenvironment. In addition, we discovered the relationship between genetic mutations and immune checkpoints.

cancer,"Sonic Hedgehog signaling is aberrantly activated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the regulatory molecules of Sonic Hedgehog signaling during NSCLC development are still largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that HHIP Like 2 (HHIPL2) is a crucial Sonic Hedgehog signaling regulator, accelerating NSCLC progression via positively governing Sonic Hedgehog signaling. Clinically, HHIPL2 is highly expressed in NSCLC and indicates a poor prognosis. Consistently, via depletion or gain of HHIPL2 in vivo and in vitro, we identified its oncogenic role in NSCLC proliferation and metastasis. Mechanistically, HHIPL2 interacted with the RNA-binding protein HNRNPC to alter its nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation. HHIPL2-regulated HNRNPC accumulation in the cytoplasm promoted the mRNA stability of HNF1A, a transcription factor for SHH, which subsequently enhanced the Sonic Hedgehog signaling activity to facilitate NSCLC progression. Furthermore, we discovered that triptolide (TPL), an HNF1A inhibitor, impeded HHIPL2-mediated Sonic Hedgehog signaling activation and NSCLC malignancy. Therefore, our findings not only uncover a previously unrecognized role for HHIPL2 in regulating the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway but also highlight a novel HHIPL2/HNRNPC/HNF1A axis as an attractive target for NSCLC therapy.Schematic diagram (created by Figdraw.com) showing that HHIPL2 positively governs Hedgehog signaling to accelerate NSCLC progression via enhancing HNRNPC-mediated HNF1A mRNA stabilization.",sonic hedgehog signal aberrantli activ nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc howev regulatori molecul sonic hedgehog signal nsclc develop still larg unknown demonstr hhip like 2 hhipl2 crucial sonic hedgehog signal regul acceler nsclc progress via posit govern sonic hedgehog signal clinic hhipl2 highli express nsclc indic poor prognosi consist via deplet gain hhipl2 vivo vitro identifi oncogen role nsclc prolifer metastasi mechanist hhipl2 interact rnabind protein hnrnpc alter nucleocytoplasm transloc hhipl2regul hnrnpc accumul cytoplasm promot mrna stabil hnf1a transcript factor shh subsequ enhanc sonic hedgehog signal activ facilit nsclc progress furthermor discov triptolid tpl hnf1a inhibitor imped hhipl2medi sonic hedgehog signal activ nsclc malign therefor find uncov previous unrecogn role hhipl2 regul sonic hedgehog signal pathway also highlight novel hhipl2hnrnpchnf1a axi attract target nsclc therapyschemat diagram creat figdrawcom show hhipl2 posit govern hedgehog signal acceler nsclc progress via enhanc hnrnpcmediat hnf1a mrna stabil
cancer,"Most neuroendocrine cancers lack caspase 8 protein expression. While this feature was thought to facilitate escape from extrinsic apoptosis, its cancer-regulatory function has remained unexplored. Here, we devise a mouse model of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) recapitulating the lack of expression of caspase 8 seen in humans and uncover an unexpected role for necroptosis-fueled pre-tumoral inflammation resulting in reprogramming towards a neuronal progenitor cell-like state and increased metastatic disease. Notably, transcriptional signatures of this cellular state are enriched in relapsed and metastatic human SCLC. Mechanistically, caspase 8 loss within the pre-tumoral niche promotes inflammation marked by increased recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) which are responsible for the promotion of metastatic disease. Importantly, inactivation of the necroptosis executioner MLKL reverses pre-tumoral inflammation, decreases metastasis as well as neuronal-like reprogramming. Taken together, our findings suggest that pre-tumoral inflammatory cell death contributes to neuronal progenitor mimicry, immunosuppression and increased metastasis in SCLC.",neuroendocrin cancer lack caspas 8 protein express featur thought facilit escap extrins apoptosi cancerregulatori function remain unexplor devis mous model small cell lung cancer sclc recapitul lack express caspas 8 seen human uncov unexpect role necroptosisfuel pretumor inflamm result reprogram toward neuron progenitor celllik state increas metastat diseas notabl transcript signatur cellular state enrich relaps metastat human sclc mechanist caspas 8 loss within pretumor nich promot inflamm mark increas recruit regulatori cell treg respons promot metastat diseas importantli inactiv necroptosi execution mlkl revers pretumor inflamm decreas metastasi well neuronallik reprogram taken togeth find suggest pretumor inflammatori cell death contribut neuron progenitor mimicri immunosuppress increas metastasi sclc
cancer,"Adult stem cells (SCs) transition between quiescent and active states to maintain tissue integrity, and dysregulation of this balance can lead to tissue degeneration, cancer, or premature aging. Both intrinsic factors and extrinsic niche signals influence these states; however, the molecular mechanisms that integrate extrinsic cues with intrinsic programs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the conserved repressive histone mark, H2AK119ub, serves as a molecular switch linking inhibitory fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signals with the quiescent transcriptional program in hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). Modulation of FGF signaling is associated with changes in H2AK119ub levels, thereby toggling HFSCs between quiescence and activation states. Mechanistically, H2AK119ub directly represses a proliferation-promoting transcriptional program preserving HFSC quiescence. Loss of H2AK119ub in HFSCs shortens the quiescent phase and induces repeated rounds of HFSC activation, ultimately leading to SC exhaustion - a hallmark of aging tissue. Analysis of other mammalian SC systems and Drosophila germline SCs confirms that H2AK119ub is a broadly conserved hallmark of quiescence and is dynamic upon SC activation. These findings reveal a signaling-epigenetic axis that controls SC quiescence and underscores the importance of the conserved role of H2AK119ub in maintaining tissue homeostasis.",adult stem cell sc transit quiescent activ state maintain tissu integr dysregul balanc lead tissu degener cancer prematur age intrins factor extrins nich signal influenc state howev molecular mechan integr extrins cue intrins program remain poorli understood show conserv repress histon mark h2ak119ub serv molecular switch link inhibitori fibroblast growth factor fgf signal quiescent transcript program hair follicl stem cell hfsc modul fgf signal associ chang h2ak119ub level therebi toggl hfsc quiescenc activ state mechanist h2ak119ub directli repress proliferationpromot transcript program preserv hfsc quiescenc loss h2ak119ub hfsc shorten quiescent phase induc repeat round hfsc activ ultim lead sc exhaust hallmark age tissu analysi mammalian sc system drosophila germlin sc confirm h2ak119ub broadli conserv hallmark quiescenc dynam upon sc activ find reveal signalingepigenet axi control sc quiescenc underscor import conserv role h2ak119ub maintain tissu homeostasi
cancer,"Probiotic-based biotherapy for colorectal cancer (CRC) faces significant challenges due to poor tumor-targeting and limited bioactivities within the complex tumor microenvironment. This study shows that Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri)'s inherent bioactivities, including proliferation, metabolism, and colorectal colonization, can be enhanced by manganese, prompting the fabrication of a manganese-engineered strain (MnLR). Oral administration of MnLR with its metabolic substrate-glycerol (MnLR/Gly) promotes the enrichment of L. reuteri and its antitumor metabolites within colon tumors. Across multiple preclinical colon tumor models, MnLR/Gly alone achieves a 95.6% inhibition of orthotopic tumor growth, liver metastases reduction by 62.1%, and confers durable protection, with 75% of prophylactically treated mice remaining long-term tumor-free and 62.5% resisting tumor rechallenge.

cancer,"The poor prognosis of bladder cancer (BCa) is primarily attributed to the acquisition of invasive and metastatic capabilities by tumor cells through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), yet the dynamic alterations in ferroptosis during EMT and their regulatory mechanisms remain unelucidated. This study is the first to reveal the mechanism by which the Smad3/CISD2 signaling axis regulates ferroptosis in mesenchymal-like bladder cancer cells. Clinical sample analysis demonstrated significantly reduced expression of E-cadherin and upregulation of N-cadherin and Vimentin in muscle-invasive bladder cancer tissues (MIBC), with EMT-related marker levels correlating with overall survival rates in BCa patients. In TGF-beta1-induced mesenchymal-like bladder cancer cells, ferroptosis-related genes (GPX4, SLC7A11) were markedly elevated, alongside increased lipid peroxides (LPO) and glutathione (GSH) levels. However, mesenchymal-like bladder cancer cells exhibited heightened sensitivity to the ferroptosis inducer Erastin, showing more pronounced suppression of proliferation, elevated ROS, higher LPO and MDA levels, and reduced GSH, confirming their enhanced susceptibility to ferroptosis. RNA-seq revealed significant downregulation of Smad3 in ferroptosis inducer treated mesenchymal-like bladder cancer cells. Smad3 knockdown further exacerbated ferroptosis markers (elevated Fe(2)(+), ROS, LPO; decreased GSH), inhibited migration, invasion, and proliferation-phenotypes reversible by ferroptosis inhibitors. Mechanistically, ChIP-seq combined with RNA-seq demonstrated that Smad3 regulates CISD2 expression by binding its promoter region, with clinical specimens confirming a positive correlation between Smad3 and CISD2 expression. Functional rescue experiments showed that CISD2 overexpression in Smad3-knockdown mesenchymal-like bladder cancer cells reversed abnormal increases in Fe(2)(+), ROS, LPO, and MDA while restoring GSH levels, indicating that Smad3 modulates ferroptosis through a CISD2-dependent pathway. In vivo experiments further demonstrated that targeting the Smad3/CISD2 axis significantly suppressed xenograft tumor growth and activated ferroptosis. In conclusion, this study elucidates a novel mechanism by which the Smad3/CISD2 axis dynamically regulates ferroptosis through redox homeostasis reprogramming during EMT, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting the progression of MIBC.",poor prognosi bladder cancer bca primarili attribut acquisit invas metastat capabl tumor cell epithelialmesenchym transit emt yet dynam alter ferroptosi emt regulatori mechan remain unelucid studi first reveal mechan smad3cisd2 signal axi regul ferroptosi mesenchymallik bladder cancer cell clinic sampl analysi demonstr significantli reduc express ecadherin upregul ncadherin vimentin muscleinvas bladder cancer tissu mibc emtrel marker level correl overal surviv rate bca patient tgfbeta1induc mesenchymallik bladder cancer cell ferroptosisrel gene gpx4 slc7a11 markedli elev alongsid increas lipid peroxid lpo glutathion gsh level howev mesenchymallik bladder cancer cell exhibit heighten sensit ferroptosi induc erastin show pronounc suppress prolifer elev ro higher lpo mda level reduc gsh confirm enhanc suscept ferroptosi rnaseq reveal signific downregul smad3 ferroptosi induc treat mesenchymallik bladder cancer cell smad3 knockdown exacerb ferroptosi marker elev fe2 ro lpo decreas gsh inhibit migrat invas proliferationphenotyp revers ferroptosi inhibitor mechanist chipseq combin rnaseq demonstr smad3 regul cisd2 express bind promot region clinic specimen confirm posit correl smad3 cisd2 express function rescu experi show cisd2 overexpress smad3knockdown mesenchymallik bladder cancer cell revers abnorm increas fe2 ro lpo mda restor gsh level indic smad3 modul ferroptosi cisd2depend pathway vivo experi demonstr target smad3cisd2 axi significantli suppress xenograft tumor growth activ ferroptosi conclus studi elucid novel mechan smad3cisd2 axi dynam regul ferroptosi redox homeostasi reprogram emt provid potenti therapeut strategi target progress mibc
cancer,"Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with radiotherapy serving as a cornerstone of treatment. However, the development of radioresistance significantly compromises therapeutic efficacy and patient outcomes. Through integrative analysis of TCGA and GEO datasets combined with quantitative proteomics, we identified acetyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSS1) as a key driver of radioresistance in breast cancer. ACSS1 is aberrantly overexpressed in breast cancer and correlates with poor prognosis following radiotherapy. Functional studies revealed that overexpressed ACSS1 is able to enhance radioresistance both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ACSS1 amplifies the ionizing radiation (IR)-induced metabolic coupling of pyruvate with ROS for acetate synthesis, which fuels energy production and expands the nuclear acetyl-CoA pool, enabling histone acetylation at DNA damage sites. Such acetylation promotes chromatin relaxation at damage sites, facilitating the recruitment of homologous recombination (HR) repair machinery and ultimately leading to radioresistance. Our findings reveal that ACSS1 orchestrates acetyl-CoA-driven histone acetylation to enhance DNA repair efficiency, highlighting a metabolic-epigenetic crosstalk that sustains radioresistance in breast cancer. Targeting ACSS1 represents a promising therapeutic strategy to sensitize tumours to radiotherapy and improve clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients.",breast cancer remain lead caus cancerrel mortal worldwid radiotherapi serv cornerston treatment howev develop radioresist significantli compromis therapeut efficaci patient outcom integr analysi tcga geo dataset combin quantit proteom identifi acetylcoa synthetas 1 acss1 key driver radioresist breast cancer acss1 aberrantli overexpress breast cancer correl poor prognosi follow radiotherapi function studi reveal overexpress acss1 abl enhanc radioresist vitro vivo mechanist acss1 amplifi ioniz radiat irinduc metabol coupl pyruv ro acet synthesi fuel energi product expand nuclear acetylcoa pool enabl histon acetyl dna damag site acetyl promot chromatin relax damag site facilit recruit homolog recombin hr repair machineri ultim lead radioresist find reveal acss1 orchestr acetylcoadriven histon acetyl enhanc dna repair effici highlight metabolicepigenet crosstalk sustain radioresist breast cancer target acss1 repres promis therapeut strategi sensit tumour radiotherapi improv clinic outcom breast cancer patient
cancer,"Epitranscriptomic modifications represent a fundamental regulatory layer in cancer biology, with RNA methylation emerging as a pivotal mechanism governing transcriptomic dynamics. Among these, 5-methylcytosine (m(5)C) RNA methylation-a ubiquitous and conserved epitranscriptomic mark-has been identified across diverse RNA species, including mRNAs, rRNAs, tRNAs, and mitochondrial RNAs. Notably, the RNA m(5)C ""writers""-enzymes responsible for installing this modification onto target RNAs-have emerged as central regulators of tumorigenesis, with NSUN (NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase) proteins playing a particularly pivotal role. We synthesize current knowledge of the cellular localization, substrate specificity, and biological functions of m(5)C-modifying enzymes, focusing predominantly on the NSUN family in the cancer context. We first dissect the spatiotemporal regulation patterns of NSUN proteins-from their nuclear roles in pre-mRNA processing to cytoplasmic functions in mRNA decay and translation-and their conserved methyltransferase domains that dictate target RNA recognition. This review further explores the molecular mechanisms by which NSUN proteins govern tumor progression, metastasis, and therapeutic responses, emphasizing their dual roles in both initiating oncogenic programs and maintaining cancer cell plasticity. Finally, we discuss the translational implications of targeting NSUN-mediated m(5)C pathways, highlighting small-molecule inhibitors designed against NSUN substrate specificity, combinatorial strategies with conventional chemotherapy or immunotherapy, and the promise of epitranscriptomic diagnostics and prognostic based on NSUN expression signatures. By positioning NSUN proteins as integral nodes in the RNA epigenomic network, this synthesis not only deepens our understanding of cancer pathogenesis but also identifies novel epitranscriptomic targets for precision oncology.",epitranscriptom modif repres fundament regulatori layer cancer biolog rna methyl emerg pivot mechan govern transcriptom dynam among 5methylcytosin m5c rna methylationa ubiquit conserv epitranscriptom markha identifi across divers rna speci includ mrna rrna trna mitochondri rna notabl rna m5c writersenzym respons instal modif onto target rnashav emerg central regul tumorigenesi nsun nop2sun rna methyltransferas protein play particularli pivot role synthes current knowledg cellular local substrat specif biolog function m5cmodifi enzym focus predominantli nsun famili cancer context first dissect spatiotempor regul pattern nsun proteinsfrom nuclear role premrna process cytoplasm function mrna decay translationand conserv methyltransferas domain dictat target rna recognit review explor molecular mechan nsun protein govern tumor progress metastasi therapeut respons emphas dual role initi oncogen program maintain cancer cell plastic final discuss translat implic target nsunmedi m5c pathway highlight smallmolecul inhibitor design nsun substrat specif combinatori strategi convent chemotherapi immunotherapi promis epitranscriptom diagnost prognost base nsun express signatur posit nsun protein integr node rna epigenom network synthesi deepen understand cancer pathogenesi also identifi novel epitranscriptom target precis oncolog
cancer,"CDK2 is a principal mediator of CDK4/6 resistance. Concurrent CDK2/4/6 blockade may be effective in treating HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer (ABC). This randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled, phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05375461) assessed the efficacy of culmerciclib, a CDK2/4/6 inhibitor, plus fulvestrant in ABC. Patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative, locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer were randomized (2:1) to receive culmerciclib plus fulvestrant or matching placebo plus fulvestrant. Between March 18, 2022 and March 3, 2023, 293 pretreated patients (median age 53.0 years; pre- or perimenopausal 42.3%; bone metastasis 65.2%) were randomized to assigned treatments. At this prespecified interim analysis, culmerciclib plus fulvestrant extended the median investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) significantly, the primary endpoint, as compared with placebo plus fulvestrant (16.6 months, 95% CI 13.8 to not evaluable versus 7.5 months, 95% CI 5.3 to 11.0; hazard ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.26-0.51; stratified log rank test P < 0.001). Consistent effects were observed across diverse subgroups of patients. At a median follow-up duration of 13.8 months, overall survival was immature. The investigators-assessed objective response rate was 40.2% (95% CI, 33.3-47.5) for culmerciclib compared to 12.1% (95% CI 6.4-20.2) for placebo (stratified Mantel-Haenszel chi(2) test P < 0.001). Diarrhea (87.1%) and neutropenia (80.4%) were the most common toxicities with culmerciclib plus fulvestrant. In conclusion, this randomized clinical trial met its primary outcome. Culmerciclib plus fulvestrant is well tolerated and leads to a significant gain in PFS of pretreated HR-positive HER2-negative ABC patients.",cdk2 princip mediat cdk46 resist concurr cdk246 blockad may effect treat hrposit her2neg advanc breast cancer abc random doubleblind parallelcontrol phase 3 trial clinicaltrialsgov nct05375461 assess efficaci culmerciclib cdk246 inhibitor plu fulvestr abc patient hrposit her2neg local recurr metastat breast cancer random 21 receiv culmerciclib plu fulvestr match placebo plu fulvestr march 18 2022 march 3 2023 293 pretreat patient median age 530 year pre perimenopaus 423 bone metastasi 652 random assign treatment prespecifi interim analysi culmerciclib plu fulvestr extend median investigatorassess progressionfre surviv pf significantli primari endpoint compar placebo plu fulvestr 166 month 95 ci 138 evalu versu 75 month 95 ci 53 110 hazard ratio 036 95 ci 026051 stratifi log rank test p 0001 consist effect observ across divers subgroup patient median followup durat 138 month overal surviv immatur investigatorsassess object respons rate 402 95 ci 333475 culmerciclib compar 121 95 ci 64202 placebo stratifi mantelhaenszel chi2 test p 0001 diarrhea 871 neutropenia 804 common toxic culmerciclib plu fulvestr conclus random clinic trial met primari outcom culmerciclib plu fulvestr well toler lead signific gain pf pretreat hrposit her2neg abc patient
cancer,"Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing a surgeon's ability to locate and resect all malignant lesions, thereby improving a patient's probability of survival. While several tumor-targeted near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores have been developed to image selected cancer types, no single tumor-targeted dye has been found to image all cancers. To remedy this deficiency, we have examined the ability of a fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-targeted NIR fluorophore to broad-spectrum solid tumors when combined with pafolacianine (OTL-38, Cytalux). Pafolacianine was selected for this imaging cocktail because it highlights all cells that express either folate receptor alpha (a receptor that is expressed on  approximately 40% of human cancers) or folate receptor beta (a related receptor expressed on tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells). An FAP-targeted conjugate of the same near-infrared fluorescent dye (S0456) was also selected because it targets myofibroblasts that infiltrate virtually all solid tumors but are essentially absent from healthy tissues. In this paper, we describe the design, synthesis, and characterization of a novel FAP ligand (FAP9) and determine its affinity (K(d)  approximately  2 nM) and specificity (>2000-fold over homologous enzymes) for FAP. We then quantify its ability to image many different cancer types in murine tumor models and combine it in different ratios with pafolacianine to determine the ratio that yields the highest total tumor fluorescence and tumor-to-background ratio in seven tumor models. Because the combination of the two fluorescent conjugates invariably images tumors better than either conjugate alone, and since the two-dye combination displays no obvious toxicities, we propose that a cocktail of FAP9-S0456 plus pafolacianine warrants evaluation as a candidate for intraoperative imaging of all human tumors.",fluorescenceguid surgeri fg emerg power tool enhanc surgeon abil locat resect malign lesion therebi improv patient probabl surviv sever tumortarget nearinfrar nir fluorophor develop imag select cancer type singl tumortarget dye found imag cancer remedi defici examin abil fibroblast activ protein faptarget nir fluorophor broadspectrum solid tumor combin pafolacianin otl38 cytalux pafolacianin select imag cocktail highlight cell express either folat receptor alpha receptor express approxim 40 human cancer folat receptor beta relat receptor express tumorassoci macrophag myeloidderiv suppressor cell faptarget conjug nearinfrar fluoresc dye s0456 also select target myofibroblast infiltr virtual solid tumor essenti absent healthi tissu paper describ design synthesi character novel fap ligand fap9 determin affin kd approxim 2 nm specif 2000fold homolog enzym fap quantifi abil imag mani differ cancer type murin tumor model combin differ ratio pafolacianin determin ratio yield highest total tumor fluoresc tumortobackground ratio seven tumor model combin two fluoresc conjug invari imag tumor better either conjug alon sinc twody combin display obviou toxic propos cocktail fap9s0456 plu pafolacianin warrant evalu candid intraop imag human tumor
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) is a preferred method for the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Two techniques of radiotherapy have been used in TNT trials so far, including long-course chemoradiotherapy (LCRT) and short-course radiotherapy (SCRT). However, to date, no study compares these techniques in a head-to-head fashion. Our objective is to compare the complete clinical response among patients with LARC who receive long or short-course radiation therapy in combination with the same chemotherapy regimen. METHODS: 158 patients (18-80 years old) with standard or high-risk LARC (T3/T4 tumor or lymph node positive) located at least 5 cm from the anal verge will be randomized into two groups: LCRT (with a dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 sessions) or SCRT (with a dose of 25 Gy in five sessions). Both of these groups will receive concurrent chemotherapy (capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) twice daily) followed by consolidation chemotherapy with the CAPEOX regimen for 6 cycles or mFOLFOX7 for 9 cycles. We will compare the complete clinical response (initially 12-16 weeks after the last RT fraction and eventually 2 weeks after the last chemotherapy cycle) by MRI as the primary endpoint. Overall survival (OS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), local control, and toxicities will be evaluated after 3-5 years as the secondary endpoints. DISCUSSION: Advances in the treatment of rectal cancer focus on metastasis control, besides local control by using neoadjuvant therapy. Determining the complete clinical response, OS, and MFS of short-course versus long-course chemoradiation will assist in choosing the best LARC treatment protocol.

It is a therapeutic bronchoscopic intervention for both benign and malignant conditions, being mostly performed with a palliative intent, especially in cases of malignant central airway obstruction (CAO).We report a previously undocumented complication of airway stenting-disintegration of a self-expanding metallic stent (SEMS) and its spontaneous expectoration. A man in his late 40s with newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the lung presented with CAO and respiratory failure. Rigid bronchoscopy with tumour debulking and Y-SEMS placement was performed, resulting in clinical stabilisation. Four-and-a-half months post-stenting, the patient presented with expectoration of metallic fragments. Bronchoscopy revealed extensive disintegration of the posterior wall of the tracheal limb of the stent, with the bronchial limbs intact. The disintegrated stent was carefully removed under rigid bronchoscopy without any complications. Given adequate airway patency, no replacement stent was inserted. The patient continued systemic chemotherapy and remained stable, with no recurrence of airway compromise.

cancer,"A phantom or vanishing tumour of the lung is an uncommon radiographic finding, often linked to fluid overload conditions such as heart failure or chronic kidney disease. It is characterised by the presence of interlobular effusion within the transverse or oblique fissure of the right lung. Despite its infrequency, it is a significant differential diagnosis for radiographic opacities in the right middle lung zone, given its potential to mimic more ominous pathologies such as neoplastic masses or infiltrative processes.In this report, we present a case involving a man in his 70s who presented with a 10-day history of productive cough, chest pain and shortness of breath. An initial chest X-ray (CXR) showed a well-defined, dense, round mass in the right lower lobe. An echocardiogram revealed a significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Following the initiation of loop diuretics and fluid restriction, the mass-like opacity completely disappeared on follow-up CXR after 7 days, confirming the diagnosis of a vanishing tumour. This case highlights the critical importance of addressing the underlying heart failure prior to considering further invasive diagnostic procedures, as this can help avoid unnecessary, expensive, and potentially harmful interventions.",phantom vanish tumour lung uncommon radiograph find often link fluid overload condit heart failur chronic kidney diseas characteris presenc interlobular effus within transvers obliqu fissur right lung despit infrequ signific differenti diagnosi radiograph opac right middl lung zone given potenti mimic omin patholog neoplast mass infiltr processesin report present case involv man 70 present 10day histori product cough chest pain short breath initi chest xray cxr show welldefin dens round mass right lower lobe echocardiogram reveal significantli reduc left ventricular eject fraction follow initi loop diuret fluid restrict masslik opac complet disappear followup cxr 7 day confirm diagnosi vanish tumour case highlight critic import address underli heart failur prior consid invas diagnost procedur help avoid unnecessari expens potenti harm intervent
cancer,"Head and neck cancers (HNCs) represent a heterogeneous group of malignancies, predominantly composed of squamous cell carcinoma. Radiotherapy (RT), either alone or concurrently with chemotherapy, remains a central component of definitive and adjuvant treatment in HNCs. The success of radiotherapy depends on precise target volume delineation, which relies heavily on advanced imaging techniques. Positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) is well-established in RT planning workflows and endorsed by international guidelines. Recent advances in molecular imaging using fibroblast activation protein inhibitors (FAPI) targeting PET tracers offer improved tumor visualization and target delineation with early studies demonstrating more distinct tumor margins and improved diagnostic performance compared with FDG PET in HNCs. These advantages align with the critical need for highly reliable imaging in a disease site where complex anatomy complicates RT delivery. Early findings suggest a promising role for FAPI PET, in refining gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation and complementing current RT workflows. Despite the promising findings, current evidence is limited to small, primarily single-center cohorts, some with heterogeneous tumor subtypes, and the absence of prospective outcome-based validation. In addition, the utility of FAPI PET in post-RT response assessment and the optimal timing of imaging has yet to be clear defined. Rigorous, methodologically well-designed prospective studies are needed to establish the clinical value, prognostic significance, and impact of FAPI PET on radiotherapy outcomes in HNCs.",head neck cancer hnc repres heterogen group malign predominantli compos squamou cell carcinoma radiotherapi rt either alon concurr chemotherapi remain central compon definit adjuv treatment hnc success radiotherapi depend precis target volum delin reli heavili advanc imag techniqu positron emiss tomographi fluorodeoxyglucos fdgpet wellestablish rt plan workflow endors intern guidelin recent advanc molecular imag use fibroblast activ protein inhibitor fapi target pet tracer offer improv tumor visual target delin earli studi demonstr distinct tumor margin improv diagnost perform compar fdg pet hnc advantag align critic need highli reliabl imag diseas site complex anatomi complic rt deliveri earli find suggest promis role fapi pet refin gross tumor volum gtv delin complement current rt workflow despit promis find current evid limit small primarili singlecent cohort heterogen tumor subtyp absenc prospect outcomebas valid addit util fapi pet postrt respons assess optim time imag yet clear defin rigor methodolog welldesign prospect studi need establish clinic valu prognost signific impact fapi pet radiotherapi outcom hnc
cancer,"Radium-223 ((223)Ra), an alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical targets bone and prolongs overall survival (OS) while reducing skeletal-related events (SREs) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients (mCRPC). However, assessing (223)Ra therapeutic response is difficult due to its distinct mechanism of action on bone remodeling and tumor microenvironment. Therefore, a multimodal approach to evaluate response is required, beyond conventional serum tumor biomarkers such as PSA and ALP. This review integrates current and emerging strategies for evaluating (223)Ra response. We discuss classic serum biomarkers, highlighting their prognostic and monitoring roles. We also examine emerging liquid biopsy tools, such as circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, bone metabolism markers and exosomes that may reflect the metabolic changes induced by (223)Ra. We also explore the clinical response patterns and limitations of imaging biomarkers that play a central role in response assessment such as (18)F-fluoride PET/CT, whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI and PSMA PET/CT. We cover RECIST-based assessments and innovative technologies, including radiomics and artificial intelligence, that integrate clinical, molecular, and imaging data to enhance outcome prediction, automate lesion analysis, and reveal patterns related to treatment response, supporting personalized care. In conclusion, a multimodal approach that combines biological and imaging markers with modern analytical methods enhances (223)Ra therapy response evaluation, leading to improved clinical outcomes in mCRPC.",radium223 223ra alphaemit radiopharmaceut target bone prolong overal surviv os reduc skeletalrel event sre metastat castrationresist prostat cancer patient mcrpc howev assess 223ra therapeut respons difficult due distinct mechan action bone remodel tumor microenviron therefor multimod approach evalu respons requir beyond convent serum tumor biomark psa alp review integr current emerg strategi evalu 223ra respons discuss classic serum biomark highlight prognost monitor role also examin emerg liquid biopsi tool circul tumor cell circul tumor dna bone metabol marker exosom may reflect metabol chang induc 223ra also explor clinic respons pattern limit imag biomark play central role respons assess 18ffluorid petct wholebodi diffusionweight mri psma petct cover recistbas assess innov technolog includ radiom artifici intellig integr clinic molecular imag data enhanc outcom predict autom lesion analysi reveal pattern relat treatment respons support person care conclus multimod approach combin biolog imag marker modern analyt method enhanc 223ra therapi respons evalu lead improv clinic outcom mcrpc
cancer,"Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted theranostic agents have transformed prostate cancer (PC) management, but their performance is limited by variable PSMA expression and off-target uptake. We investigates the first-in-human positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of prostatic acid phosphatase (ACP3), a novel and highly specific PC target, using the radioligand [(68)Ga]Ga-OncoACP3-DOTA. We analyzed and matched [(68)Ga]Ga-OncoACP3-DOTA and [(18)F]PSMA-1007 PET scans in a cohort of 25 patients with PC. We compared the biodistribution and tumor uptake of the two tracers using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and compared their performance. Superiority was defined as >10% more lesions detected or >50% higher lesional maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)). [(68)Ga]Ga-OncoACP3-DOTA showed low background uptake, including in the salivary glands and kidneys, with a significant difference from the high [(18)F]PSMA-1007 uptake in these organs (p < 0.002). Overall, SUV(max) in localized or metastatic PC did not significantly differ between the two tracers. Better [(68)Ga]Ga-OncoACP3-DOTA performance was observed in 11/25 matched scan pairs, and better [(18)F]PSMA-1007 performance in eight of 25 pairs. [(68)Ga]Ga-OncoACP3-DOTA changed therapeutic management in three of six patients with biochemical recurrence, and in two of 12 patients with known metastases. Although the retrospective comparison is potentially biased, the intense and reliable tumor uptake and the low off-target activity of OncoACP3-DOTA provide a strong rationale for future exploration in trials on PET imaging and radioligand therapy with beta- and alpha-particle emitters.",prostatespecif membran antigen psmatarget theranost agent transform prostat cancer pc manag perform limit variabl psma express offtarget uptak investig firstinhuman positron emiss tomographi pet imag prostat acid phosphatas acp3 novel highli specif pc target use radioligand 68gagaoncoacp3dota analyz match 68gagaoncoacp3dota 18fpsma1007 pet scan cohort 25 patient pc compar biodistribut tumor uptak two tracer use wilcoxon ranksum test compar perform superior defin 10 lesion detect 50 higher lesion maximum standard uptak valu suvmax 68gagaoncoacp3dota show low background uptak includ salivari gland kidney signific differ high 18fpsma1007 uptak organ p 0002 overal suvmax local metastat pc significantli differ two tracer better 68gagaoncoacp3dota perform observ 1125 match scan pair better 18fpsma1007 perform eight 25 pair 68gagaoncoacp3dota chang therapeut manag three six patient biochem recurr two 12 patient known metastas although retrospect comparison potenti bias intens reliabl tumor uptak low offtarget activ oncoacp3dota provid strong rational futur explor trial pet imag radioligand therapi beta alphaparticl emitt
cancer,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In EMPIRE-1, [(18)F]-fluciclovine positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to guide salvage radiotherapy (RT) for prostate cancer recurrence after prostatectomy resulted in an improvement in event-free survival (EFS) over conventional imaging alone. The aim of EMPIRE-2 was to explore the impact of RT dose escalation to sites of uptake on PET in comparison to EMPIRE-1. METHODS: EMPIRE-2 was a randomized trial of [(18)F]-fluciclovine versus [(68)Ga]-PSMA-11 in a cohort of men with biochemical progression after prostatectomy and negative conventional imaging findings. After stratification, patients were randomized to RT guided by [(18)F]-fluciclovine PET (arm 1) or [(68)Ga]-PSMA-11 PET (arm 2). PET findings were used for treatment decisions and for RT dose escalation (</=76.0 Gy to the prostate bed and </=56.0 Gy to the pelvis). The primary endpoint was 2-yr EFS in comparison to the [(18)F]-fluciclovine RT arm in EMPIRE-1. The secondary endpoint was a planned EFS comparison for [(18)F]-fluciclovine versus [(68)Ga]-PSMA-11 in EMPIRE-2. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: In the cohort of 140 patients, 59 randomized to arm 1 patients and 60 randomized to arm 2 completed RT. Median follow-up was 2.6 yr (interquartile range 1.8-4.0). The 2-yr EFS rates were 87% for the overall EMPIRE-2 cohort versus 80% for the EMPIRE-1 comparison cohort (difference 7.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.7-12%; p = 0.01). After propensity score weighting, the corresponding 2-yr EFS rates were 84% versus 73% (difference 11%, 95% CI 3.6-24%; p = 0.01).

cancer,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening for prostate cancer (PCa) has limited accuracy, and it is linked to overdiagnosis. The PROSA trial aimed to evaluate whether a contrast-free biparametric magnetic resonance imaging (bpMRI)-first screening strategy improves the detection of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) as the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes included overall PCa detection, benefit-harm metrics, and cost effectiveness from a health care payer perspective. METHODS: This single-center, randomized controlled trial enrolled 816 asymptomatic men aged 49-69 yr (>/=40 yr with a PCa family history). Participants were randomized into two arms: arm A underwent bpMRI regardless of the PSA levels; arm B received bpMRI only if PSA >/=3 ng/ml (or 2.5 ng/ml with a family history). Men with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score >/=3 were directed to a targeted biopsy. Imaging and pathology assessors were blinded; csPCa is defined as International Society of Urological Pathology grade group >/=2. The primary outcomes included csPCa detection, benefit-harm metrics, and cost effectiveness from a health care payer perspective. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Among 759 randomized men, biopsy and csPCa detection rates were higher in arm A (10.8% and 4.6%, respectively) than in arm B (5.2% and 1.8%, respectively), with a relative risk of 2.6 (95% confidence interval 1.1-6.1; p = 0.05) for the csPCa detection rate. Benefit-harm metrics favored the MRI-first strategy, showing higher grade selectivity (1.89 vs 1.75), biopsy efficiency (0.74 vs 0.54), and biopsy avoidance (23.1 vs 11.9). No serious adverse event was recorded. The MRI-first strategy yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro2201.75 per csPCa case detected. Limitations include single-round design and short follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In this randomized screening trial, a contrast-free MRI-first pathway improved csPCa detection, enhanced benefit-harm metrics, and showed favorable cost effectiveness.",background object prostatespecif antigen psabas screen prostat cancer pca limit accuraci link overdiagnosi prosa trial aim evalu whether contrastfre biparametr magnet reson imag bpmrifirst screen strategi improv detect clinic signific pca cspca primari outcom secondari outcom includ overal pca detect benefitharm metric cost effect health care payer perspect method singlecent random control trial enrol 816 asymptomat men age 4969 yr 40 yr pca famili histori particip random two arm arm underw bpmri regardless psa level arm b receiv bpmri psa 3 ngml 25 ngml famili histori men prostat imag report data system score 3 direct target biopsi imag patholog assessor blind cspca defin intern societi urolog patholog grade group 2 primari outcom includ cspca detect benefitharm metric cost effect health care payer perspect key find limit among 759 random men biopsi cspca detect rate higher arm 108 46 respect arm b 52 18 respect rel risk 26 95 confid interv 1161 p 005 cspca detect rate benefitharm metric favor mrifirst strategi show higher grade select 189 vs 175 biopsi effici 074 vs 054 biopsi avoid 231 vs 119 seriou advers event record mrifirst strategi yield increment costeffect ratio euro220175 per cspca case detect limit includ singleround design short followup conclus clinic implic random screen trial contrastfre mrifirst pathway improv cspca detect enhanc benefitharm metric show favor cost effect
cancer,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Digital pathology-based artificial intelligence (DP-AI) biomarkers are emerging as transformative tools to guide clinical management of patients affected by various malignancies. We aimed to synthesise current evidence regarding their prognostic and predictive utility in urologic cancers. METHODS: In this prospectively registered systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD420251036536), we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science in April 2025 for studies evaluating the prognostic and predictive values of DP-AI models in patients with prostate (PCa), bladder (BCa), renal cell (RCC), testicular (TCa), or penile (PeCa) cancer. The risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool. Results were tabulated and summarised qualitatively. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Of the 1537 screened individual records, we included 31 studies validating DP-AI models in 21 155 patients. Nineteen studies were conducted in PCa (n = 17 541), six in BCa (n = 2349), five in RCC (n = 1176), and one in TCa (n = 89) patients. Ten PCa studies (n = 8951) utilised the ArteraAI model, including two (n = 2786) showing that it allows identification of patients treated with radiotherapy for clinically localised PCa that can safely omit short-term (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR] 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.19-0.63) or long-term (sHR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.41-0.73) androgen deprivation therapy. Two studies (n = 894) developed and validated a model allowing identification of patients with non-muscle-invasive BCa poorly responding to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (HR 2.3; 95% CI: 1.9-2.8), including one study (n = 253) validating a predictive biomarker for patients who may benefit from upfront gemcitabine/docetaxel. Many DP-AI models showed a prognostic association in localised PCa (n = 16 863), metastatic PCa (n = 678), non-muscle-invasive BCa (n = 2069), muscle-invasive BCa (n = 280), localised RCC (n = 1176), and germline TCa (n = 89) settings. None of the included studies assessed DP-AI models prospectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: DP-AI biomarkers hold promise to improve treatment personalisation through integration into clinical practice.

cancer,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) is one of the procedures most often performed by trainee urologists. ENTRY is a cooperative partnership aimed at improving the training of urology residents. Metrics for TURBT were published after a Delphi consensus process involving experts. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and construct validity (via known-group and convergent validity) of objective metrics for characterizing the intraoperative performance of TUTBT as optimal versus suboptimal. METHODS: Thirty videos of TURBT performed by experts (n = 15) and novices (n = 15) were evaluated by three experienced urologists trained to reliably and independently score TURBT performance using the metrics previously developed. The videos were anonymized and the assessors were blinded to the surgeon, hospital, and expertise. The inter-rater reliability score was assessed and surgical errors were reported using a dummy dichotomous variable. A two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test was applied for between-group comparisons. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: The median number of overall errors was 1 (interquartile range [IQR] 0-2) in the expert group versus 5 (IQR 4-7) in the novice group, with a median difference of -4 errors (95% confidence interval [CI] -5 to -3; p = 0.001). The median number of noncritical errors per TURBT procedure was 1 (IQR 0-2) in the expert group versus 3 (IQR 2-4) in the novice group, with a median difference of -2 errors (95% CI -3 to -1; p = 0.001). The median number of critical errors was 0 (IQR 0-1) for the expert group versus 2 (IQR 2-3) for the novice group, with a median difference of -2 errors (95% CI -3 to -1; p = 0.001). We compared the performance of the expert and novice groups, which revealed a concordance index of 0.6 for noncritical errors, 0.73 for critical errors, and 0.66 for overall errors. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our study demonstrates the construct validity of metrics developed for the quality of TURBT performance. This represents a further step in establishing a quality-assured structured and standardized training program for TURBT.",background object transurethr resect bladder tumor turbt one procedur often perform traine urologist entri cooper partnership aim improv train urolog resid metric turbt publish delphi consensu process involv expert aim studi assess reliabl construct valid via knowngroup converg valid object metric character intraop perform tutbt optim versu suboptim method thirti video turbt perform expert n 15 novic n 15 evalu three experienc urologist train reliabl independ score turbt perform use metric previous develop video anonym assessor blind surgeon hospit expertis interrat reliabl score assess surgic error report use dummi dichotom variabl twosampl wilcoxon ranksum mannwhitney test appli betweengroup comparison key find limit median number overal error 1 interquartil rang iqr 02 expert group versu 5 iqr 47 novic group median differ 4 error 95 confid interv ci 5 3 p 0001 median number noncrit error per turbt procedur 1 iqr 02 expert group versu 3 iqr 24 novic group median differ 2 error 95 ci 3 1 p 0001 median number critic error 0 iqr 01 expert group versu 2 iqr 23 novic group median differ 2 error 95 ci 3 1 p 0001 compar perform expert novic group reveal concord index 06 noncrit error 073 critic error 066 overal error conclus clinic implic studi demonstr construct valid metric develop qualiti turbt perform repres step establish qualityassur structur standard train program turbt

cancer,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate patient and pharmacist satisfaction with two information systems using QR codes to access information about oral cancer treatments. METHODS: THERANOVA-LIM (NCT04931329) was a prospective, descriptive, single-centre study of cancer patients receiving oral treatment. Patients were divided into two groups: one group using the information card and the other using the standard prescription with QR code. Patient satisfaction was assessed at 3 months using questionnaires. RESULTS: In all, 128 patients were included: 55 received a 'drug information card' and 73 a 'prescription with QR code'. The median age was 69 (37-90). The three most common cancers were breast (37.5%), prostate (14.1%) and brain (10.9%). The vast majority of patients had metastatic cancer (90%). The three most prescribed drugs were capecitabine (21.1%), ribociclib (11.7%) and temozolomide (11.7%). Patients presented the QR codes during medical consultations (25.0%), pharmacy visits (100%) and during home visits by nurses (25.0%). Both patients and professionals were satisfied with these new systems. Pharmacists felt that the prescription with a QR code was more useful for their daily practice in the pharmacy (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: QR code systems proved effective in providing information to patients and healthcare professionals. The QR code prescription appeared to be the most practical for pharmacy activities.

cancer,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The addition of docetaxel to radiotherapy (RT) and long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is not a standard of care for the treatment of high-risk localized prostate cancer (HRLPC). We performed an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to assess the addition of docetaxel to RT and ADT in HRLPC. METHODS: IPD from patients with HRLPC (as defined by any of the following risk factors: Gleason score >/=8, prostate-specific antigen >20 ng/ml, cT3-T4, and/or N1) treated in trials evaluating RT + ADT +/- docetaxel, available in the Intermediate Clinical Endpoints in Carcinoma of the Prostate (ICECaP) repository, were collated. The primary outcome was metastasis-free survival (MFS), and the secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), and time to metastasis (TTM). Analyses were conducted using a one-stage IPD meta-analysis. Disease risk was defined as high (one risk factor) or very high (two to three risk factors and/or N1). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards and Fine-Gray competing risk models estimated the effect of addition of docetaxel to RT + ADT on each time-to-event outcome. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 1690 patients from four trials were included. Docetaxel did not lead to an overall benefit in MFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.89), OS (HR 0.88), and TTM (HR 0.87), but there was a significant benefit in EFS (HR 0.87) and PCSM (HR 0.70). The 5- and 10-yr MFS rates were, respectively, 79% and 57% in patients treated with RT + ADT, and 84% and 62% in those who received RT + ADT + docetaxel. There was no clear evidence of a greater benefit of docetaxel in patients with very-high-risk disease than in those with high-risk disease (MFS: HR 0.87 vs 0.97; OS: HR 0.86 vs 0.95; EFS: HR 0.83 vs 0.93; TTM: HR 0.86 vs 0.92; and PCSM: HR 0.70 vs 0.73), with no statistically significant difference in treatment effect by risk group (all p-interaction >0.1). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Addition of docetaxel to RT + ADT did not lead to a significant benefit in MFS or OS. Clinical stratification together with biomarkers should be evaluated to determine whether biologic features can identify HRLPC patients who are more likely to benefit from intensification of therapy with docetaxel.",background object addit docetaxel radiotherapi rt longterm androgen depriv therapi adt standard care treatment highrisk local prostat cancer hrlpc perform individu patient data ipd metaanalysi assess addit docetaxel rt adt hrlpc method ipd patient hrlpc defin follow risk factor gleason score 8 prostatespecif antigen 20 ngml ct3t4 andor n1 treat trial evalu rt adt docetaxel avail intermedi clinic endpoint carcinoma prostat icecap repositori collat primari outcom metastasisfre surviv mf secondari outcom overal surviv os eventfre surviv ef prostat cancerspecif mortal pcsm time metastasi ttm analys conduct use onestag ipd metaanalysi diseas risk defin high one risk factor high two three risk factor andor n1 multivari cox proport hazard finegray compet risk model estim effect addit docetaxel rt adt timetoev outcom key find limit total 1690 patient four trial includ docetaxel lead overal benefit mf hazard ratio hr 089 os hr 088 ttm hr 087 signific benefit ef hr 087 pcsm hr 070 5 10yr mf rate respect 79 57 patient treat rt adt 84 62 receiv rt adt docetaxel clear evid greater benefit docetaxel patient veryhighrisk diseas highrisk diseas mf hr 087 vs 097 os hr 086 vs 095 ef hr 083 vs 093 ttm hr 086 vs 092 pcsm hr 070 vs 073 statist signific differ treatment effect risk group pinteract 01 conclus clinic implic addit docetaxel rt adt lead signific benefit mf os clinic stratif togeth biomark evalu determin whether biolog featur identifi hrlpc patient like benefit intensif therapi docetaxel
cancer,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recent Edinburgh-based research demonstrated high negative predictive value (NPV) for urinary dipstick testing for haematuria (UDH) in low-risk bladder cancer surveillance. This enabled a new protocol where flexible cystoscopy in surveillance years 2 and 4 is performed only if UDH is positive. Adopted across Scotland and included as aspirational in European Association of Urology guidelines, this protocol has yet to be validated in real-world settings. This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes of low-risk bladder cancer with the implementation of the new surveillance protocol. METHODS: The protocol began in December 2018. All patients with low-risk bladder cancer on initial transurethral resection of bladder tumour were included from January 2019 to February 2025. General practitioners conducted UDH in surveillance years 2 and 4; cystoscopy followed if positive. Patient and clinical data were prospectively recorded using a standardised institutional pro forma. This study performed the first clinical evaluation of the deintensified low-risk protocol. The study evaluated the recurrence and progression rates, NPV of UDH throughout surveillance, and number of check cystoscopies performed. The statistical analysis used Stata-BE version 19.0 for Mac. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 250 patients were observed with a recurrence rate of 14.4% and a progression rate of 1.6%, similar to preprotocol outcomes. The NPV of UDH remained above 94% throughout surveillance. Flexible cystoscopy use declined by 18.2%, saving at least  pound51 000. Limitations included a lack of randomisation, modest cohort sizes at 4 and 5 yr of surveillance, and absence of patient-reported outcomes.

cancer,"Cuproptosis offers a promising alternative to apoptosis-based cancer therapies but faces challenges, such as poor tumor drug accumulation, rapid clearance of copper ionophores, and high intracellular glutathione (GSH). Herein, we developed a GSH-responsive prodrug polymersome (PED@ICG) for copper-independent cuproptosis and synergistic photothermal therapy. Diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC) was covalently attached via disulfide bonds, ensuring a GSH-triggered release and intracellular GSH depletion. The amphiphilic polyprodrug formed stable polymersomes, and ICG coloading endowed imaging ability and NIR-activated photothermal heating. PED@ICG exhibited efficient cellular uptake through dynamin-mediated endocytosis, achieved deep tumor penetration, and selectively released DTC within the reductive tumor microenvironment. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated potent anticancer efficacy without the need for exogenous copper, while NIR irradiation further enhanced therapeutic outcomes through localized hyperthermia. This work offers a promising strategy for precise cuproptosis modulation and photothermal synergism, providing a clinically translatable nanoplatform for copper-independent tumor therapy.",cuproptosi offer promis altern apoptosisbas cancer therapi face challeng poor tumor drug accumul rapid clearanc copper ionophor high intracellular glutathion gsh herein develop gshrespons prodrug polymersom pedicg copperindepend cuproptosi synergist phototherm therapi diethyldithiocarbam dtc coval attach via disulfid bond ensur gshtrigger releas intracellular gsh deplet amphiphil polyprodrug form stabl polymersom icg coload endow imag abil niractiv phototherm heat pedicg exhibit effici cellular uptak dynaminmedi endocytosi achiev deep tumor penetr select releas dtc within reduct tumor microenviron vitro vivo studi demonstr potent anticanc efficaci without need exogen copper nir irradi enhanc therapeut outcom local hyperthermia work offer promis strategi precis cuproptosi modul phototherm synerg provid clinic translat nanoplatform copperindepend tumor therapi
cancer,"Chromatin architecture plays a key role in development and cancer, yet most studies lack mechanistic depth due to widespread epigenomic remodeling. To address this, we tracked chromatin structure dynamics during the progression of endocrine resistance in ER(+) breast cancer using Hi-C, chromatin accessibility, epigenomic, and transcriptomic profiling. We uncovered a critical role for H3K9 methylation and the demethylase KDM4C association with SWI/SNF in driving proliferation of cells fated to become resistant through a nongenomic estrogen-mediated mechanism. These findings highlight the mechanistic contribution of chromatin regulation in therapy resistance and offer a blueprint for studying similar processes in cancer, development, and cell fate decisions.",chromatin architectur play key role develop cancer yet studi lack mechanist depth due widespread epigenom remodel address track chromatin structur dynam progress endocrin resist er breast cancer use hic chromatin access epigenom transcriptom profil uncov critic role h3k9 methyl demethylas kdm4c associ swisnf drive prolifer cell fate becom resist nongenom estrogenmedi mechan find highlight mechanist contribut chromatin regul therapi resist offer blueprint studi similar process cancer develop cell fate decis
cancer,"BACKGROUND: The BRCA2 c.8351G>A p.(Arg2784Gln) variant has long been classified as a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) due to conflicting evidence used in variant classification. This study aims to clarify its pathogenicity and associated risks for breast and ovarian cancer. METHODS: This study was conducted by the international Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles consortium. We collected data from 29 informative families with this variant. Co-segregation likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated using the full-likelihood method to assess pathogenicity, and cancer risks were estimated with modified segregation analysis. RESULTS: Co-segregation analysis using a grid search across scaled penetrance levels for BRCA2 truncating variants yielded the strongest evidence in favour of pathogenicity, with LR maximised at approximately 20% of full penetrance (LR=11.026). Furthermore, estimated breast cancer risks were markedly higher for early onset breast cancer; women diagnosed at <50 years had a HR of 4.5, compared with a HR of 1.65 for women diagnosed at >/=50 years. The estimated lifetime risks were 25% for breast cancer and 6% for ovarian cancer.Evidence of pathogenicity was also supported by the presence of the variant allele in two patients with Fanconi anaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that BRCA2 c.8351G>A p.(Arg2784Gln) has a disease-causing effect, with reduced penetrance, similar to other pathogenic variants in moderate risk breast cancer genes such as ATM and CHEK2. We also provide risk-adapted recommendations for clinical management.

cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Cytotoxic drugs (cytostatics), widely used in the treatment of not only cancer diseases, are substances with potentially dangerous properties for healthcare personnel. Long-term daily exposure to cytostatics is associated with the possible manifestation of their genotoxic, carcinogenic and teratogenic effects. Handling of these drugs (during receipt, storage, preparation, packaging, transport, administration) can lead to contamination of the workplace and thus to exposure of healthcare personnel present. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our work was to propose, based on previous results and experience gained from long-term monitoring, a limit threshold value for surface contamination with cytotoxic drugs. METHODOLOGY: As part of the long-term monitoring (2008-2021) of surface contamination by cytostatics in pharmacies and hospitals in the Czech and Slovak Republics, the presence of eight drugs (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, methotrexate, irinotecan, paclitaxel, fluorouracil, gemcitabine and platinum as a representative of platinum cytostatics - oxaliplatin, carboplatin, cisplatin) was monitored. Samples were taken by employees of individual healthcare facilities and surface contamination was evaluated by the RECETOX Research Center of Masaryk University Brno using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. RESULTS: our study evaluated the surface contamination of cytostatics in 40 pharmacies (N = 1,277 samples) and 43 hospitals (N = 946 samples). Based on the results obtained and in accordance with currently known knowledge, we propose a threshold value of 100 pg/cm2 as the limit value of permissible contamination of cytostatics for most areas in pharmacies and hospitals (reception, storage, packaging, transport, application). On the one hand, contamination in isolator areas, where cytostatics are prepared in a controlled environment and using effective protective equipment and where their increased presence can therefore be ""expected"", should be perceived differently, and on the other hand, areas in administrative facilities and day rooms, where no protective equipment is used and contamination should therefore be zero. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the level of contamination in healthcare facilities working with cytotoxic drugs helps to set up work processes so that the working environment is safe for employees. Regular monitoring is an important tool. The proposal of a value of 100 pg/cm2 as an exposure hygiene limit represents the first step towards implementing mandatory monitoring into national legislation.",introduct cytotox drug cytostat wide use treatment cancer diseas substanc potenti danger properti healthcar personnel longterm daili exposur cytostat associ possibl manifest genotox carcinogen teratogen effect handl drug receipt storag prepar packag transport administr lead contamin workplac thu exposur healthcar personnel present object aim work propos base previou result experi gain longterm monitor limit threshold valu surfac contamin cytotox drug methodolog part longterm monitor 20082021 surfac contamin cytostat pharmaci hospit czech slovak republ presenc eight drug cyclophosphamid ifosfamid methotrex irinotecan paclitaxel fluorouracil gemcitabin platinum repres platinum cytostat oxaliplatin carboplatin cisplatin monitor sampl taken employe individu healthcar facil surfac contamin evalu recetox research center masaryk univers brno use liquid chromatographi tandem mass spectrometri induct coupl plasma mass spectrometri result studi evalu surfac contamin cytostat 40 pharmaci n 1277 sampl 43 hospit n 946 sampl base result obtain accord current known knowledg propos threshold valu 100 pgcm2 limit valu permiss contamin cytostat area pharmaci hospit recept storag packag transport applic one hand contamin isol area cytostat prepar control environ use effect protect equip increas presenc therefor expect perceiv differ hand area administr facil day room protect equip use contamin therefor zero conclus knowledg level contamin healthcar facil work cytotox drug help set work process work environ safe employe regular monitor import tool propos valu 100 pgcm2 exposur hygien limit repres first step toward implement mandatori monitor nation legisl
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a common side effect in patients with breast cancer. Various non-pharmacological interventions are employed to alleviate CRF; however, current research lacks evaluations of their efficacy. This study compared the effectiveness of different non-pharmacological interventions on CRF in patients with breast cancer and to provide references for future research and clinical practice. METHODS: We systematically searched multiple databases, including the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (VIP), China Biology Medicine (CBM), PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and EMBASE, covering the period from the inception of each database to August 2024. The quality of the included studies was assessed via the AMSTAR-2 scale (a measurement tool to assess systematic reviews 2), and evidence mapping was used to summarise the characteristics of included studies. RESULTS: 52 systematic reviews/meta-analyses were included. The types of non-pharmacological interventions included 34 exercise interventions, 6 multidimensional interventions (a multimodal intervention approach involving three or more non-pharmacological therapies), 4 psychosocial interventions, 2 massage or acupuncture therapies, 2 art therapies, 1 moxibustion, 1 dietary supplement, 1 continuity of care and 1 systemic care. The conclusions of these studies were categorised as 'beneficial' for 41 studies, 'may be beneficial' for 9 studies and 'inconclusive' for 2 studies. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence mapping revealed that exercise interventions are the most widely used and effective interventions for CRF in patients with breast cancer. However, owing to the variety of non-pharmacological interventions and the fact that some of them are less common in studies, more large-sample, high-quality, prospective randomised trials and systematic reviews/meta-analyses involving different interventions are needed to further validate them in the future.",background cancerrel fatigu crf common side effect patient breast cancer variou nonpharmacolog intervent employ allevi crf howev current research lack evalu efficaci studi compar effect differ nonpharmacolog intervent crf patient breast cancer provid refer futur research clinic practic method systemat search multipl databas includ china nation knowledg infrastructur cnki wanfang vip databas chines technic period vip china biolog medicin cbm pubm web scienc cochran librari embas cover period incept databas august 2024 qualiti includ studi assess via amstar2 scale measur tool assess systemat review 2 evid map use summaris characterist includ studi result 52 systemat reviewsmetaanalys includ type nonpharmacolog intervent includ 34 exercis intervent 6 multidimension intervent multimod intervent approach involv three nonpharmacolog therapi 4 psychosoci intervent 2 massag acupunctur therapi 2 art therapi 1 moxibust 1 dietari supplement 1 continu care 1 system care conclus studi categoris benefici 41 studi may benefici 9 studi inconclus 2 studi conclus evid map reveal exercis intervent wide use effect intervent crf patient breast cancer howev owe varieti nonpharmacolog intervent fact less common studi largesampl highqual prospect randomis trial systemat reviewsmetaanalys involv differ intervent need valid futur
cancer,"OBJECTIVES: Men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) suffer from symptoms related to both their disease and its treatment with marked variation between individuals with respect to symptom expression. This study aimed to determine whether genetic variation in cytokine expression is associated with symptom severity. METHODS: An exploratory prospective, longitudinal consecutive patient cohort study was undertaken across two Queensland sites. Patient characteristics including tumour burden and current treatment were collected at baseline. Symptom severity was assessed 3-4 weekly for up to 6 assessments, with blood taken for genetic analysis once only during the study. Cytokine gene variants of each participant were assessed using a panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) most described in the literature. RESULTS: Of the 66 participants, 27/66 (41%) had a low, and 39/66 (59%) a high tumour burden. Symptom severity was not related to tumour burden or patient characteristics. Of the 142 SNPs analysed from 62 participants, 15 SNPs from 7 genes were significantly associated with symptom severity. After Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment, SNPs rs2069772 from Interleukin-2 (IL2) and rs230494 from Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFKb) remained significant. CONCLUSION: Although multiple factors can influence symptom severity, genetic variation may play a part. The early identification of men likely to develop severe symptoms during the course of their prostate cancer could theoretically enable symptoms to be managed more aggressively from an early stage. These preliminary findings need to be replicated in a larger cohort of men with CRPC.",object men castrateresist prostat cancer crpc suffer symptom relat diseas treatment mark variat individu respect symptom express studi aim determin whether genet variat cytokin express associ symptom sever method exploratori prospect longitudin consecut patient cohort studi undertaken across two queensland site patient characterist includ tumour burden current treatment collect baselin symptom sever assess 34 weekli 6 assess blood taken genet analysi studi cytokin gene variant particip assess use panel singl nucleotid polymorph snp describ literatur result 66 particip 2766 41 low 3966 59 high tumour burden symptom sever relat tumour burden patient characterist 142 snp analys 62 particip 15 snp 7 gene significantli associ symptom sever benjaminihochberg adjust snp rs2069772 interleukin2 il2 rs230494 nuclear factor kappalightchainenhanc activ b cell nfkb remain signific conclus although multipl factor influenc symptom sever genet variat may play part earli identif men like develop sever symptom cours prostat cancer could theoret enabl symptom manag aggress earli stage preliminari find need replic larger cohort men crpc
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the factors for increasing sedentary time during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in older patients with locally advanced oesophageal cancer (LAEC) and to elucidate potential clinical mechanisms. METHODS: We conducted a single-centre exploratory prospective cohort study. Between October 2021 and December 2023, consecutive 80 patients with LAEC aged >/=65 years were scheduled for curative oesophagectomy after NAC. The change in sedentary time (Delta=after NAC - before NAC; expressed in min/week) was calculated from sedentary time measured by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. Factors associated with the change in sedentary time were investigated using a multivariate regression model. Two-tailed statistical significance was accepted at p<0.05. RESULTS: A total of 69 patients were included in the analysis. The mean age was 72.9 years, and docetaxel+cisplatin + fluorouracil, cisplatin+fluorouracil and oxaliplatin+leucovorin + fluorouracil regimens were administered to 46 (67%), 4 (6%) and 19 (27%) patients, respectively. The mean sedentary times before and after chemotherapy were 3235+/-1477 min/week and 3557+/-1598 min/week, and the mean change in sedentary time during chemotherapy was 322+/-736 min/week. Worsening fatigue was a significant factor influencing increased sedentary time during chemotherapy (vs non-worsening fatigue, adjusted coefficient 531.111, 95% CI 104.960 to 957.261, p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical mechanism of increasing sedentary time during chemotherapy may be associated with worsening fatigue. In older adults with LAEC, a physical activity intervention during NAC may improve clinical outcomes.",object studi aim investig factor increas sedentari time neoadjuv chemotherapi nac older patient local advanc oesophag cancer laec elucid potenti clinic mechan method conduct singlecentr exploratori prospect cohort studi octob 2021 decemb 2023 consecut 80 patient laec age 65 year schedul cur oesophagectomi nac chang sedentari time deltaaft nac nac express minweek calcul sedentari time measur global physic activ questionnair factor associ chang sedentari time investig use multivari regress model twotail statist signific accept p005 result total 69 patient includ analysi mean age 729 year docetaxelcisplatin fluorouracil cisplatinfluorouracil oxaliplatinleucovorin fluorouracil regimen administ 46 67 4 6 19 27 patient respect mean sedentari time chemotherapi 32351477 minweek 35571598 minweek mean chang sedentari time chemotherapi 322736 minweek worsen fatigu signific factor influenc increas sedentari time chemotherapi vs nonworsen fatigu adjust coeffici 531111 95 ci 104960 957261 p0015 conclus clinic mechan increas sedentari time chemotherapi may associ worsen fatigu older adult laec physic activ intervent nac may improv clinic outcom
cancer,"Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) of patients with differentiated metastatic thyroid cancer has been standard treatment for more than 80 y. A high and uniform expression of the NaI symporter in malignant thyroid cells results in tumoricidal absorbed doses (ADs) delivered by the beta-particle emissions of the radioactive iodine ((131)I). Treatment is less effective for patients whose disease exhibits reduced or variable expression of NaI symporter. Methods: We have investigated a treatment strategy that combines radioiodine with external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for patients with low (131)I uptake. By combining the AD delivered by the RPT agent with that delivered by EBRT, we achieve the targeted tumoricidal AD (80 Gy 2-Gy equieffective dose) while maintaining safe normal-organ AD. A tracer administration of RPT is used to calculate a patient-specific administered activity (AA) for therapy that yields organ-at-risk ADs below toxicity thresholds. The tumor and relevant organ-at-risk ADs from the therapeutic administration are calculated and provided to the radiation oncology medical physicists for combination therapy planning. We illustrate this precision-medicine approach to treating thyroid cancer patients using data from the first 5 patients in our ongoing clinical trial. Results: A precision-medicine approach gave an AA ranging from 14.3 to 19.5 GBq. Combined RPT-EBRT therapy of the selected lesions yielded doses ranging from 73 to 147 Gy. Conclusion: We have demonstrated the feasibility of combined RPT-EBRT in thyroid cancer patients with reduced radioiodine uptake when a standard AA of 5.55 GBq (150 mCi) would have delivered a much lower AD to lesions, less likely to lead to a response. There is considerable patient variability in clearance kinetics. Clinical benefit assessment in adjusting AA on the basis of a precision methodology would require a multicenter trial.",radiopharmaceut therapi rpt patient differenti metastat thyroid cancer standard treatment 80 high uniform express nai symport malign thyroid cell result tumoricid absorb dose ad deliv betaparticl emiss radioact iodin 131i treatment less effect patient whose diseas exhibit reduc variabl express nai symport method investig treatment strategi combin radioiodin externalbeam radiotherapi ebrt patient low 131i uptak combin ad deliv rpt agent deliv ebrt achiev target tumoricid ad 80 gy 2gi equieffect dose maintain safe normalorgan ad tracer administr rpt use calcul patientspecif administ activ aa therapi yield organatrisk ad toxic threshold tumor relev organatrisk ad therapeut administr calcul provid radiat oncolog medic physicist combin therapi plan illustr precisionmedicin approach treat thyroid cancer patient use data first 5 patient ongo clinic trial result precisionmedicin approach gave aa rang 143 195 gbq combin rptebrt therapi select lesion yield dose rang 73 147 gy conclus demonstr feasibl combin rptebrt thyroid cancer patient reduc radioiodin uptak standard aa 555 gbq 150 mci would deliv much lower ad lesion less like lead respons consider patient variabl clearanc kinet clinic benefit assess adjust aa basi precis methodolog would requir multicent trial
cancer,"Cells navigate within diverse curved microenvironments derived from extracellular matrix (ECM) and neighboring cells in vivo. While current studies primarily focus on cell migration on curved surfaces, cellular adaptive responses to confinement-coupled geometric curvature remain largely unexplored. Herein, we design a confined curvature-based microfluidic chip (CCM-Chip) that mimics the physiologically relevant physical cues encountered during cell migration and investigate how cells dynamically answer to local geometric features. In the CCM-Chip, cells exhibit shape bending, nuclear deformation, and cytoskeletal remodeling that correlate with local geometric curvature. We then engineer a microgrooved uniaxial stretching microdevice to manipulate cell shape and find that curvature-induced cell shape results in nuclear envelope stretching, thus initiating downstream nuclear responses. Significantly, the stretched nuclear envelope effectively triggers the recruitment of cPLA2 to the nucleus, with nesprin and SUN1 serving as critical mediators in the process of nuclear mechanotransduction. The cPLA2 activation promotes stress fiber polarization at the cell front and enhances cellular contractility, facilitating curvature-induced cell migration. This work provides a versatile biomimetic microdevice for cell migration studies and highlights the key role of nuclear deformation-induced cPLA2 signaling in adaptive cell migration, advancing the development of therapeutic strategies against cancer metastasis.",cell navig within divers curv microenviron deriv extracellular matrix ecm neighbor cell vivo current studi primarili focu cell migrat curv surfac cellular adapt respons confinementcoupl geometr curvatur remain larg unexplor herein design confin curvaturebas microfluid chip ccmchip mimic physiolog relev physic cue encount cell migrat investig cell dynam answer local geometr featur ccmchip cell exhibit shape bend nuclear deform cytoskelet remodel correl local geometr curvatur engin microgroov uniaxi stretch microdevic manipul cell shape find curvatureinduc cell shape result nuclear envelop stretch thu initi downstream nuclear respons significantli stretch nuclear envelop effect trigger recruit cpla2 nucleu nesprin sun1 serv critic mediat process nuclear mechanotransduct cpla2 activ promot stress fiber polar cell front enhanc cellular contractil facilit curvatureinduc cell migrat work provid versatil biomimet microdevic cell migrat studi highlight key role nuclear deformationinduc cpla2 signal adapt cell migrat advanc develop therapeut strategi cancer metastasi
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Western diet and associated production of secondary bile acids (BAs) have been linked to the development of sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC). Despite observational studies showing that secondary BAs produced by 7alpha-dehydroxylating (7alphaDH+) gut bacteria are increased in CRC, a causal proof of their tumour-promoting effects is lacking. OBJECTIVE: Investigate the causal role of BAs produced by 7alphaDH+ gut bacteria in CRC. DESIGN: We performed feeding studies in a porcine model of CRC combined with multi-omics analyses and gnotobiotic mouse models colonised with 7alphaDH+ bacteria or a genetically modified strain to demonstrate causality. RESULTS: Western diet exacerbated the CRC phenotype in APC (1311/+) pigs. This was accompanied by increased levels of the secondary BA deoxycholic acid (DCA) and higher colonic epithelial cell proliferation. The latter was counteracted by the BA-scavenging drug colestyramine. Metagenomic analysis across multiple human cohorts revealed higher occurrence of bai (BA inducible) operons from Clostridium scindens and close relatives in faeces of patients with CRC. Addition of these specific 7alphaDH+ bacteria (C. scindens/Extibacter muris) to defined communities of gut bacteria led to DCA production and increased colon tumour burden in mouse models of chemically or genetically induced CRC. A mutant strain of Faecalicatena contorta lacking 7alphaDH caused fewer colonic tumours in azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate treated mice and triggered less epithelial cell proliferation in human colon organoids compared with wild-type F. contorta. CONCLUSION: This work provides functional evidence for the causal role of secondary BAs produced by gut bacteria through 7alphaDH in CRC under adverse dietary conditions, opening avenues for future preventive strategies.",background western diet associ product secondari bile acid ba link develop sporad colorect cancer crc despit observ studi show secondari ba produc 7alphadehydroxyl 7alphadh gut bacteria increas crc causal proof tumourpromot effect lack object investig causal role ba produc 7alphadh gut bacteria crc design perform feed studi porcin model crc combin multiom analys gnotobiot mous model colonis 7alphadh bacteria genet modifi strain demonstr causal result western diet exacerb crc phenotyp apc 1311 pig accompani increas level secondari ba deoxychol acid dca higher colon epitheli cell prolifer latter counteract bascaveng drug colestyramin metagenom analysi across multipl human cohort reveal higher occurr bai ba induc operon clostridium scinden close rel faec patient crc addit specif 7alphadh bacteria c scindensextibact muri defin commun gut bacteria led dca product increas colon tumour burden mous model chemic genet induc crc mutant strain faecalicatena contorta lack 7alphadh caus fewer colon tumour azoxymethanedextran sodium sulfat treat mice trigger less epitheli cell prolifer human colon organoid compar wildtyp f contorta conclus work provid function evid causal role secondari ba produc gut bacteria 7alphadh crc advers dietari condit open avenu futur prevent strategi
cancer,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of cervical high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) in a community-based setting and its risk factors association in women living in hard-to-reach areas in Bangladesh. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study SETTING: The study was carried out in six subdistricts, located in hard-to-reach and climate-impacted regions of Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 8000 married women aged 30-60 years were invited for screening. Women who were unable to give consent, were pregnant or had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix, previous screening less than 5 years, or treatment of the cervix or had symptoms of potential cervical cancer were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: A community-based hrHPV self-collected screening for cervical cancer was conducted from June 2022 to July 2023. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of cervical hrHPV and risk factor association. RESULTS: 11 127 women were eligible for screening; 7850 women submitted hrHPV self-swabs, 7828 valid HPV test results were reported and 164 women (2.1%) tested hrHPV positive. Women living in the North were 2.1 times more likely to be hrHPV positive compared with women living in the South (adjusted OR (AOR)=2.1, 95% CI: 1.5 to 3.8, p=0.023) and widowed women were 3.0 times more likely to be hrHPV positive than married women (AOR=3.0, 95% CI: 1.7 to 5.3, p=0.001). Another risk factor associated with testing hrHPV positive was the use of hormonal contraceptives for 5 years and above (AOR=7.0, 95% CI: 2.0 to 24.4, p=0.002). CONCLUSION: The study identified a low overall prevalence of hrHPV infection (2.1%) among women in hard-to-reach areas in Bangladesh, with some regional variations. Higher prevalence was observed in widowed compared with married women and among women reporting more than 5 years of hormonal contraceptive use. This study shows no evidence of particularly high-risk groups in hard-to-reach areas in Bangladesh. The findings support the feasibility of implementing a nationwide hr-HPV-based self-sampling strategy as a viable approach to reach WHO targets for reducing the burden of cervical cancer. Recommendation for policymakers to support future research to identify hrHPV prevalence among women in comparable groups in other geographically remote areas in Bangladesh.

cancer,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the association between the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the prognosis of patients with breast cancer (BC) in southern Ethiopia. DESIGN: We conducted a hospital-based retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The study was conducted at Hawassa and Wolaita Sodo University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 492 women with BC diagnosed from January 2020 to December 2022 were enrolled. Follow-up extended from the date of diagnosis until the occurrence of an event (death), loss to follow-up or the study end date. OUTCOME MEASURES: Data were collected using a structured data collection tool through medical record review and exported to Stata V.16 for analysis. Unweighted and weighted Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to estimate death-free survival time. Inverse-probability-weighted regression adjustment was employed to estimate the association of NLR with time to death. At a statistical significance level of p<0.05, regression coefficients with 95% CIs were reported. RESULTS: The incidence of mortality in patients with BC with a higher NLR was 4.2 (95% CI 3.3 to 5.2) per 100 person-month observation (PMO); it was 1.9 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.4) per 100 PMO for those with a low NLR. When everyone in the population of interest has a low NLR, the average time to death is estimated as 17.2 (95% CI 11.4 to 23.0) months. For women with a higher NLR, the average time to death is estimated as 10.8 (95% CI 8.93 to 12.8) months. For women with a higher NLR, the average time to death was shorter by 6.3 months (coefficient: -6.3, 95% CI -12.5 to -0.082). Furthermore, the effectiveness of exposure to high NLR (ratio of average treatment effect to low NLR potential outcome means) was a 36.7% (95% CI 12% to 61%) reduction in mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: A high NLR was associated with significantly higher mortality in BC patients, independent of baseline clinicopathological variables. Patients with elevated NLR more often presented with advanced stage disease and distant metastases. These findings indicate that NLR, a simple and accessible biomarker, may help to identify patients at increased risk of poor prognosis.",object studi aim examin associ neutrophiltolymphocyt ratio nlr prognosi patient breast cancer bc southern ethiopia design conduct hospitalbas retrospect cohort studi set studi conduct hawassa wolaita sodo univers comprehens special hospit particip total 492 women bc diagnos januari 2020 decemb 2022 enrol followup extend date diagnosi occurr event death loss followup studi end date outcom measur data collect use structur data collect tool medic record review export stata v16 analysi unweight weight kaplanmei surviv curv use estim deathfre surviv time inverseprobabilityweight regress adjust employ estim associ nlr time death statist signific level p005 regress coeffici 95 ci report result incid mortal patient bc higher nlr 42 95 ci 33 52 per 100 personmonth observ pmo 19 95 ci 15 24 per 100 pmo low nlr everyon popul interest low nlr averag time death estim 172 95 ci 114 230 month women higher nlr averag time death estim 108 95 ci 893 128 month women higher nlr averag time death shorter 63 month coeffici 63 95 ci 125 0082 furthermor effect exposur high nlr ratio averag treatment effect low nlr potenti outcom mean 367 95 ci 12 61 reduct mortal rate conclus high nlr associ significantli higher mortal bc patient independ baselin clinicopatholog variabl patient elev nlr often present advanc stage diseas distant metastas find indic nlr simpl access biomark may help identifi patient increas risk poor prognosi
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Sexual concerns are a key unmet need among patients with cancer. Women are less likely than men to be assessed for sexual concerns, due in part to a lack of appropriate screening tools. The Self-Efficacy to Communicate about Sex and Intimacy (SECSI) scale measures perceived ability to communicate about sex and intimacy during cancer yet has not been evaluated among patients undergoing active treatment. OBJECTIVES: This study describes sexual, emotional, and interpersonal well-being of partnered women undergoing chemotherapy and evaluates the psychometrics of the SECSI in this sample. METHODS: Participants (N = 149) completed measures of mental health, sexual health, and relationship satisfaction. RESULTS: Almost 60% of participants reported engaging in sexual activity in the last month. Participants reported feeling most bothered by low sexual interest. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated a single-factor structure was insufficient for the SECSI while exploratory factor analysis extracted one factor. Convergent and discriminant validity of the SECSI were also supported by this study's findings. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates women undergoing chemotherapy are both engaged in sexual activity, yet bothered by decreased interest, and provides further support for the use of the SECSI in a group of women currently in chemotherapy.",background sexual concern key unmet need among patient cancer women less like men assess sexual concern due part lack appropri screen tool selfefficaci commun sex intimaci secsi scale measur perceiv abil commun sex intimaci cancer yet evalu among patient undergo activ treatment object studi describ sexual emot interperson wellb partner women undergo chemotherapi evalu psychometr secsi sampl method particip n 149 complet measur mental health sexual health relationship satisfact result almost 60 particip report engag sexual activ last month particip report feel bother low sexual interest confirmatori factor analysi indic singlefactor structur insuffici secsi exploratori factor analysi extract one factor converg discrimin valid secsi also support studi find conclus studi indic women undergo chemotherapi engag sexual activ yet bother decreas interest provid support use secsi group women current chemotherapi
cancer,"OBJECTIVES: Many patients with breast cancer (BC) experience reproductive concerns that contribute to psychosocial distress. Although many patients experience elevated levels of distress, few pursue psychosocial support (PSS) to manage their distress. We characterized the associations between BC patients' PSS utilization and demoralization, hopelessness, anxiety, depression, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and previous experiences with psychosocial providers. METHODS: One hundred and four BC patients with reproductive concerns were recruited. Bivariate correlations assessed the relationships between measures of psychosocial distress and health care utilization. Independent logistic regressions were run to evaluate the unique associations between predictors of interest and PSS utilization. RESULTS: Most participants (57.7%) reported utilizing PSS during treatment. Higher levels of demoralization (OR = 1.109, p = 0.004) and HRQOL (OR = 0.964, p = 0.010) were significantly associated with increased odds of PSS utilization. Prior satisfaction with mental healthcare practitioners was also significantly associated with psychosocial utilization (OR = 0.561, p = 0.018). Anxiety, depression, and hopelessness were not significantly associated with PSS utilization. CONCLUSIONS: These data underscore the role of demoralization, HRQOL, and prior mental health care experiences in BC patient's PSS utilization. Many distress screening tools assess patients for the presence of depression and anxiety, but do not assess for demoralization. Thus, incorporating demoralization into screening tools may better identify and engage BC patients with reproductive concerns in PSS services.",object mani patient breast cancer bc experi reproduct concern contribut psychosoci distress although mani patient experi elev level distress pursu psychosoci support pss manag distress character associ bc patient pss util demor hopeless anxieti depress healthrel qualiti life hrqol previou experi psychosoci provid method one hundr four bc patient reproduct concern recruit bivari correl assess relationship measur psychosoci distress health care util independ logist regress run evalu uniqu associ predictor interest pss util result particip 577 report util pss treatment higher level demor 1109 p 0004 hrqol 0964 p 0010 significantli associ increas odd pss util prior satisfact mental healthcar practition also significantli associ psychosoci util 0561 p 0018 anxieti depress hopeless significantli associ pss util conclus data underscor role demor hrqol prior mental health care experi bc patient pss util mani distress screen tool assess patient presenc depress anxieti assess demor thu incorpor demor screen tool may better identifi engag bc patient reproduct concern pss servic
cancer,"CD47 plays an important role in immune evasion through suppressing macrophage phagocytosis. CD47 blockade has been widely explored in immunotherapy of cancers through enhancing macrophage phagocytosis. However, the role of CD47 in lung cancer cell apoptosis and ferroptosis is not well defined. In this study, we found that CD47 was highly expressed and ferroportin (FPN) was low expressed in lung cancer cells. Over-expression of CD47 increased the expression of Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2); but suppressed the expression of FPN. Knock-down and blockade of CD47 expression and activity suppressed the expression of Nrf2 and enhanced the expression of FPN, subsequently improved lung cancer cell ferroptosis, accompanied with increased expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hemosiderin deposition. Suppression of Nrf2 activity by Brusatol increased FPN expression at a concentration-dependent manner; whereas over-expression of FPN increased lung cancer cell ferroptosis. More studies in mouse model showed that knockdown of CD47 effectively attenuated lung cancer cell growth after subcutaneous inoculation of shCD47-pretreated LLC cells, associated with increased infiltration of neutrophils, CD8+ T cells and Malondialdehyde (MDA) products. Meanwhile, the expressions of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta were elevated in the treated tumor tissues.

cancer,"Despite multimodality treatment efforts, resistance to platinum and PARP inhibitors represents a primary impediment to improve prognosis of ovarian cancer. Here, we found that ovarian cancer tissues had higher C/EBPbeta expression compared with normal tissues and high C/EBPbeta expression predicted unfavorable survival outcomes. Elevated C/EBPbeta expression enhanced cisplatin resistance and olaparib resistance. C/EBPbeta could affect DDR signals of ovarian cancer. CDK12, serving as a C/EBPbeta-regulated DDR-related gene, was directly targeted by and bound with C/EBPbeta. C/EBPbeta could promote CDK12 expression and confer drug tolerance via CDK12. Manipulation of CDK12 could reverse the effects of C/EBPbeta. Using CDK12 inhibitor THZ531 could rescue C/EBPbeta-mediated cisplatin resistance and olaparib resistance. Our findings indicated that C/EBPbeta is a potent DDR regulator of ovarian cancer, which directly targets CDK12 and upregulates its expression. High C/EBPbeta expression mediates platinum resistance and PARP inhibitor resistance via CDK12. Targeting C/EBPbeta via CDK12 inhibition could rescue drug responsiveness of ovarian cancer, thereby counteracting platinum and PARP inhibitor resistance. C/EBPbeta could thus be exploited as a candidate prognostic biomarker in ovarian cancer.",despit multimod treatment effort resist platinum parp inhibitor repres primari impedi improv prognosi ovarian cancer found ovarian cancer tissu higher cebpbeta express compar normal tissu high cebpbeta express predict unfavor surviv outcom elev cebpbeta express enhanc cisplatin resist olaparib resist cebpbeta could affect ddr signal ovarian cancer cdk12 serv cebpbetaregul ddrrelat gene directli target bound cebpbeta cebpbeta could promot cdk12 express confer drug toler via cdk12 manipul cdk12 could revers effect cebpbeta use cdk12 inhibitor thz531 could rescu cebpbetamedi cisplatin resist olaparib resist find indic cebpbeta potent ddr regul ovarian cancer directli target cdk12 upregul express high cebpbeta express mediat platinum resist parp inhibitor resist via cdk12 target cebpbeta via cdk12 inhibit could rescu drug respons ovarian cancer therebi counteract platinum parp inhibitor resist cebpbeta could thu exploit candid prognost biomark ovarian cancer

This study characterized the carcinogenic potential of single or combined dietary exposure to Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP, a PAH) and a mixture of six food-derived NOCs in the A/J Min/+ mouse model for human colorectal cancer. Mice were given diets containing low or high concentrations of BaP and/or NOCs for nine weeks. The concentrations were based on estimated daily intake levels in the European population. A sex-dependent increased CRC initiation was detected after combined exposure to the high doses of BaP and NOCs. No effects were seen on CRC following exposure to the low doses of BaP or NOCs individually or in combination. Targeted plasma metabolomics revealed alterations in cellular membranes, lipid and energy metabolism in mice exposed to the high doses of BaP and NOCs. An alteration of plasma metabolites was also seen in mice exposed to the low dose of BaP, but not in mice exposed to the low dose of NOCs or to the combined low doses of BaP and NOCs. The study highlights the complex interplay between dietary carcinogens.",process meat contain multipl substanc mutagen properti limit knowledg combin effect polycycl aromat hydrocarbon pah nnitroso compound noc studi character carcinogen potenti singl combin dietari exposur benzoapyren bap pah mixtur six foodderiv noc aj min mous model human colorect cancer mice given diet contain low high concentr bap andor noc nine week concentr base estim daili intak level european popul sexdepend increas crc initi detect combin exposur high dose bap noc effect seen crc follow exposur low dose bap noc individu combin target plasma metabolom reveal alter cellular membran lipid energi metabol mice expos high dose bap noc alter plasma metabolit also seen mice expos low dose bap mice expos low dose noc combin low dose bap noc studi highlight complex interplay dietari carcinogen
cancer,"Breast cancer remains a major global health challenge, with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) posing a particular therapeutic dilemma due to its lack of targetable receptors and reliance on chemotherapy, which is often thwarted by drug resistance. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel metal-polyphenol nano-platform (DLF@NPs) via a one-pot coordination assembly of L-dopa (L-DA), doxorubicin (DOX), and ferrous ions (Fe(2+)). This GSH/pH-dual-responsive nanoparticle exploits the overexpression of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) on breast cancer cells for targeted delivery and tumor-specific enrichment, effectively addressing the off-target toxicity and resistance associated with free DOX. Upon internalization into the acidic and high-GSH tumor microenvironment, DLF@NPs rapidly disassemble, releasing their payload. The liberated DOX not only exerts its apoptotic effect but also activates NADPH oxidases (NOXs) to elevate intracellular H(2)O(2) levels. This endogenous H(2)O(2) supply fuels a Fenton reaction catalyzed by the co-released Fe(2+), generating highly toxic hydroxyl radicals. Furthermore, L-DA reduces the resultant Fe(3+) back to Fe(2+), establishing a catalytic cycle that robustly amplifies reactive oxygen species (ROS). The resultant ROS burst synergizes with DOX by inducing severe mitochondrial damage, leading to potentiated apoptosis. In summary, this work proposes a novel targeted nanoplatform that utilizes the synergy between chemodynamic therapy and chemotherapy to provide a promising strategy for combating drug-resistant breast cancer.",breast cancer remain major global health challeng tripleneg breast cancer tnbc pose particular therapeut dilemma due lack target receptor relianc chemotherapi often thwart drug resist overcom limit develop novel metalpolyphenol nanoplatform dlfnp via onepot coordin assembl ldopa lda doxorubicin dox ferrou ion fe2 gshphdualrespons nanoparticl exploit overexpress ltype amino acid transport 1 lat1 breast cancer cell target deliveri tumorspecif enrich effect address offtarget toxic resist associ free dox upon intern acid highgsh tumor microenviron dlfnp rapidli disassembl releas payload liber dox exert apoptot effect also activ nadph oxidas nox elev intracellular h2o2 level endogen h2o2 suppli fuel fenton reaction catalyz coreleas fe2 gener highli toxic hydroxyl radic furthermor lda reduc result fe3 back fe2 establish catalyt cycl robustli amplifi reactiv oxygen speci ro result ro burst synerg dox induc sever mitochondri damag lead potenti apoptosi summari work propos novel target nanoplatform util synergi chemodynam therapi chemotherapi provid promis strategi combat drugresist breast cancer
cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC), a malignancy characterized by high aggressiveness, metastatic propensity, frequent recurrence, and poor prognosis, underscores the critical need for identifying biomarkers to guide targeted therapeutic strategies. Solute carrier family 38 member 5 (SLC38A5) emerges as a promising target due to its pharmacological tractability and role in cancer progression. In this study, we demonstrate that SLC38A5 promoted CRC progression through both bioinformatic analysis and experimental validation. Knockdown of SLC38A5 significantly suppressed cell viability, colony formation, and migratory ability in DLD1 and HCT116 cells. Notably, SLC38A5 depletion sensitized CRC cells to RSL3-induced ferroptosis. Mechanistically, SLC38A5 inhibition down-regulated antioxidant-related genes Nrf2 and Heme Oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and key ferroptosis regulators GPX4 and SLC7A11, while modulating Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long-Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) and Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 (SCD1) expression. Additionally, SLC38A5 knockdown impaired nuclear translocation of YAP, the core transcriptional co-activator in the Hippo signaling pathway. ‌Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis demonstrated the binding of YAP to Nrf2. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism wherein SLC38A5 confers ferroptosis resistance in CRC via YAP nuclear translocation within the Hippo signaling pathway. Collectively, this study highlights SLC38A5 as a potential therapeutic target to enhance ferroptosis-based cancer therapy, offering new strategies to improve CRC treatment outcomes.",colorect cancer crc malign character high aggress metastat propens frequent recurr poor prognosi underscor critic need identifi biomark guid target therapeut strategi solut carrier famili 38 member 5 slc38a5 emerg promis target due pharmacolog tractabl role cancer progress studi demonstr slc38a5 promot crc progress bioinformat analysi experiment valid knockdown slc38a5 significantli suppress cell viabil coloni format migratori abil dld1 hct116 cell notabl slc38a5 deplet sensit crc cell rsl3induc ferroptosi mechanist slc38a5 inhibit downregul antioxidantrel gene nrf2 heme oxygenas 1 ho1 key ferroptosi regul gpx4 slc7a11 modul acylcoa synthetas longchain famili member 4 acsl4 stearoylcoa desaturas 1 scd1 express addit slc38a5 knockdown impair nuclear transloc yap core transcript coactiv hippo signal pathway ‌chromatin immunoprecipit chip analysi demonstr bind yap nrf2 find reveal novel mechan wherein slc38a5 confer ferroptosi resist crc via yap nuclear transloc within hippo signal pathway collect studi highlight slc38a5 potenti therapeut target enhanc ferroptosisbas cancer therapi offer new strategi improv crc treatment outcom
cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of patient and area-level sociodemographic factors associated with the use of GC testing for localized PCa. Although genomic classifiers (GC) can improve stratification of prostate cancer (PCa) risk and facilitate personalization of treatment decision making, the factors influencing a patient's use of GCs remains poorly characterized. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study to identify patients who were diagnosed with localized PCa from 2012-2022 and received genomic testing. We compiled clinical, area deprivation index (ADI), and health insurance information. The primary study outcome was receipt of the GC assay from biopsy. Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between ADI and receipt of a GC test. RESULTS: Among 2,103 eligible patients, 40.1% underwent genomic testing, and of those, 97.5% had available ADI information. A higher proportion of patients in the least deprived areas received genomic testing (40.9%) compared to those in the most deprived areas (34.6%) (p<0.001). When adjusting for clinical and pathologic factors, age at time of biopsy, Hispanic ethnicity, and residence in a more deprived area were associated with lower odds of receiving a GC test. Among tested patients, ADI was not significantly associated with GC risk (all p-values >0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Use of genomic testing was lower in patients living in areas with higher levels of social disadvantage, as well as patients of Hispanic ethnicity. These findings highlight potential sources of disparity in the use of discretionary risk assessment tools for PCa.",object evalu associ patient arealevel sociodemograph factor associ use gc test local pca although genom classifi gc improv stratif prostat cancer pca risk facilit person treatment decis make factor influenc patient use gc remain poorli character method conduct retrospect studi identifi patient diagnos local pca 20122022 receiv genom test compil clinic area depriv index adi health insur inform primari studi outcom receipt gc assay biopsi logist regress analys use evalu associ adi receipt gc test result among 2103 elig patient 401 underw genom test 975 avail adi inform higher proport patient least depriv area receiv genom test 409 compar depriv area 346 p0001 adjust clinic patholog factor age time biopsi hispan ethnic resid depriv area associ lower odd receiv gc test among test patient adi significantli associ gc risk pvalu 005 conclus use genom test lower patient live area higher level social disadvantag well patient hispan ethnic find highlight potenti sourc dispar use discretionari risk assess tool pca
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Germline alterations and smoking status in lung cancer could inform etiology and clinical decisions. We explored germline alteration prevalence in predisposition genes across lung cancer histologies from two large populations. METHODS: Germline sequencing of 11,740 primary lung cancers was performed with Tempus xT tumor-normal matched assay (DNAseq of 648 genes at average 500x coverage, normal specimens at 150x coverage, full transcriptome RNA-seq). Pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) potential germline alterations in 46 genes were compared between smokers and never smokers; never smokers somatic EGFR altered (sEGFRalt) and wild-type (sEGFRwt); non-small cell (NSCLC) and small cell (SCLC) histologies; and NSCLC sEGFRalt and NSCLC sEGFRwt. P/LP variants were investigated in these 46 genes in 1,330 patients with lung cancer from the UK BioBank by smoking status. FINDINGS: Tempus sequencing revealed P/LP alterations in 4.8% of smokers and 5.8% of never smokers, with most alterations in MUTYH (1.3% vs. 1.1%), ATM (0.7% vs. 1.0%), BRCA2 (0.6% vs. 0.9%) and EGFR (< 0.1% vs. 0.4%). Never-smoker sEGFRalt (n=549) and sEGFRwt (n=1025) tumors had alterations in MUTYH (1.1% vs. 1.1%), ATM (0.7% vs. 1.1%), and EGFR (1.1% vs. 0%). NSCLC and SCLC tumors had alterations in MUTYH (1.3% vs. 0.3%), ATM (0.8% vs. 0.3%), and BRCA2 (0.7% vs. 0%). sEGFRalt and sEGFRwt NSCLC tumors had germline alterations in MUTYH (1.6% vs 1.3%), ATM (0.5% vs. 0.8%), EGFR (1.3% vs. 0%), and BRCA2 (0.8% vs. 0.6%). UK Biobank patients had similar P/LP alterations: 4.3% of smokers and 5.1% of never-smokers, with most germline alterations in ATM (0.8%), BRCA2 (0.79%) and MUTYH (0.62%) in smokers and MUTYH (1.5%) and CHEK2 (1.01%) in never-smokers. INTERPRETATION: Similar distribution of P/LP potential germline alterations in lung cancer subtypes from distinct populations by smoking status suggests increased next-generation germline sequencing may improve risk assessment.",background germlin alter smoke statu lung cancer could inform etiolog clinic decis explor germlin alter preval predisposit gene across lung cancer histolog two larg popul method germlin sequenc 11740 primari lung cancer perform tempu xt tumornorm match assay dnaseq 648 gene averag 500x coverag normal specimen 150x coverag full transcriptom rnaseq pathogeniclik pathogen plp potenti germlin alter 46 gene compar smoker never smoker never smoker somat egfr alter segfralt wildtyp segfrwt nonsmal cell nsclc small cell sclc histolog nsclc segfralt nsclc segfrwt plp variant investig 46 gene 1330 patient lung cancer uk biobank smoke statu find tempu sequenc reveal plp alter 48 smoker 58 never smoker alter mutyh 13 vs 11 atm 07 vs 10 brca2 06 vs 09 egfr 01 vs 04 neversmok segfralt n549 segfrwt n1025 tumor alter mutyh 11 vs 11 atm 07 vs 11 egfr 11 vs 0 nsclc sclc tumor alter mutyh 13 vs 03 atm 08 vs 03 brca2 07 vs 0 segfralt segfrwt nsclc tumor germlin alter mutyh 16 vs 13 atm 05 vs 08 egfr 13 vs 0 brca2 08 vs 06 uk biobank patient similar plp alter 43 smoker 51 neversmok germlin alter atm 08 brca2 079 mutyh 062 smoker mutyh 15 chek2 101 neversmok interpret similar distribut plp potenti germlin alter lung cancer subtyp distinct popul smoke statu suggest increas nextgener germlin sequenc may improv risk assess
cancer,"BRAF V600E mutation (BRAFm) is present in around 8% of metastatic colorectal cancers (mCRC) and is associated with a poor prognosis. The encorafenib-cetuximab combination (ENCO-CET) is currently the standard second-line treatment of BRAFm mCRC. However, 2-5% of patients treated with cetuximab experience grade 3-4 infusion-related reactions (IRRs), leading to treatment discontinuation. In addition, BRAF inhibitors must be combined with an anti-EGFR to have any efficacy in BRAFm mCRCCitation. As panitumumab (PANI) is associated with a lower risk of IRRs, this study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of ENCO-PANI as an alternative strategy in patients experiencing an IRR to CET. We retrospectively collected BRAFm mCRC patients that switched ENCO-CET for ENCO-PANI following an IRR to CET. Twenty pts were identified across 12 centers from 4 countries. Most were male (12/20), 11/20 had right-sided primary tumor and 5/20 pts were dMMR/MSI. Median age was 66, treatment line was 2(nd) line in 85% and 3(rd) line in 15% of patients; 19 patients started ENCO-CET and switched to ENCO-PANI (cycle 2 or 3) and 1 received ENCO-PANI upfront due to patient's choice. Response rate was 25% and disease control rate 85%. Median progression-free survival was 6.2 and median overall survival 11 months. Adverse events (AEs) during ENCO-PANI occurred in 15/20, mostly G1-G2. No new IRRs nor toxic deaths were reported. ENCO-PANI appears to be as safe and effective in pts treated for a BRAFm mCRC unable to continue CET and may represent a valid alternative therapeutic option in this setting.",braf v600e mutat brafm present around 8 metastat colorect cancer mcrc associ poor prognosi encorafenibcetuximab combin encocet current standard secondlin treatment brafm mcrc howev 25 patient treat cetuximab experi grade 34 infusionrel reaction irr lead treatment discontinu addit braf inhibitor must combin antiegfr efficaci brafm mcrccitat panitumumab pani associ lower risk irr studi aim assess safeti efficaci encopani altern strategi patient experienc irr cet retrospect collect brafm mcrc patient switch encocet encopani follow irr cet twenti pt identifi across 12 center 4 countri male 1220 1120 rightsid primari tumor 520 pt dmmrmsi median age 66 treatment line 2nd line 85 3rd line 15 patient 19 patient start encocet switch encopani cycl 2 3 1 receiv encopani upfront due patient choic respons rate 25 diseas control rate 85 median progressionfre surviv 62 median overal surviv 11 month advers event ae encopani occur 1520 mostli g1g2 new irr toxic death report encopani appear safe effect pt treat brafm mcrc unabl continu cet may repres valid altern therapeut option set
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates remain limited, and effective methods for offering the choice of colonoscopy or stool testing through outreach have not been identified. We evaluate the effect of sequential choice compared to colonoscopy outreach on screening completion, and further evaluate behavioral nudges in the electronic health record (EHR). METHODS: In this pragmatic randomized clinical trial, patients were randomly allocated in a 1:2:2 ratio to 1) usual care (no outreach), 2) colonoscopy only, or 3) sequential choice of colonoscopy, then fecal immunochemical testing (FIT). Patients in arms 2 and 3 were additionally randomized to receive either (a) usual care, or (b) a visit-based, clinician-directed nudge facilitated by the EHR with follow-up texting to the patient. The primary outcome is CRC screening completion within 3 years by either colonoscopy, 2 negative fecal immunochemical tests (FIT), or 1 positive FIT followed by colonoscopy within one year. ANALYSIS: For the patient-directed analysis, the primary outcome will be evaluated by comparing CRC screening completion among patients randomized to either outreach arm (2 or 3) to the no outreach arm (1). We will also compare completion between the colonoscopy only arm (1) and the sequential choice arm (2). For the visit-based analysis, we will compare CRC screening completion among patients between the usual care arms (2a and 3a) and the nudge arms (2b and 3b). CONCLUSION: This trial is unique in evaluating the long-term effectiveness of offering sequential choice to colonoscopy alone through a multi-level, centralized outreach and visit-based design.

cancer,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common and intolerable adverse effect of oxaliplatin and paclitaxel. The intolerance to CIPN symptoms often leads to poor compliance and treatment discontinuation, jeopardizing survival outcomes. However, no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved interventions exist for preventing or treating CIPN. A major challenge has been that neuroprotective candidates often diminish the effectiveness of chemotherapy, limiting their translational development. Here, we aimed to identify neuroprotective agents that maintain anticancer activity. Using ND7/23 dorsal root ganglion neurons treated with oxaliplatin and paclitaxel, we screened our compound library and identified formononetin, a natural isoflavone, as a promising candidate. Formononetin significantly protected ND7/23 DRG neurons against oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity by reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis via activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) antioxidant pathway and modulating protein expressions of pro-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X (Bax) and anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2). Formononetin showed limited protection against paclitaxel-induced structural neurite damage. Importantly, unlike the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which decreased the anticancer effectiveness of both oxaliplatin and paclitaxel, formononetin maintained their anticancer effects in colorectal cancer HT29 cells and cervical cancer SiHa cells. Taken together, formononetin holds potential as a neuroprotectant to prevent oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity without compromising anticancer efficacy.",chemotherapyinduc peripher neuropathi cipn common intoler advers effect oxaliplatin paclitaxel intoler cipn symptom often lead poor complianc treatment discontinu jeopard surviv outcom howev food drug administr fdaapprov intervent exist prevent treat cipn major challeng neuroprotect candid often diminish effect chemotherapi limit translat develop aim identifi neuroprotect agent maintain anticanc activ use nd723 dorsal root ganglion neuron treat oxaliplatin paclitaxel screen compound librari identifi formononetin natur isoflavon promis candid formononetin significantli protect nd723 drg neuron oxaliplatininduc neurotox reduc oxid stress apoptosi via activ nuclear factor erythroid 2relat factor 2 nrf2heme oxygenase1 ho1 antioxid pathway modul protein express proapoptot bcell lymphoma 2associ x bax antiapoptot bcell lymphoma 2 bcl2 formononetin show limit protect paclitaxelinduc structur neurit damag importantli unlik ro scaveng nacetylcystein nac decreas anticanc effect oxaliplatin paclitaxel formononetin maintain anticanc effect colorect cancer ht29 cell cervic cancer siha cell taken togeth formononetin hold potenti neuroprotect prevent oxaliplatininduc neurotox without compromis anticanc efficaci

cancer,"Cholangiocarcinoma is often very challenging to diagnose due to high false negative biopsy rates. There are known precursors to cholangiocarcinoma such as primary sclerosing cholangitis and hepatitis; however, identifying early and sensitive biomarkers for liver injury and tumor progression could enhance cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and management. Recent studies have suggested blood and bile-based microRNA (miRNA) panels performed better than existing tumor markers. To further investigate this, we conducted next-generation sequencing of thioacetamide (TAA) induced cholangiocarcinoma in an established rat model. We identified 2938 unique differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 27 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) between tumor bearing rats and normal controls. Pathway analyses on the DEGs and DEMs revealed the molecular mechanisms of hepatic hyperplasia and nephritis. To filter for ideal biomarkers, we further performed qPCR on bile and serum. Three miRNAs (miR-146b-5p, miR-223-3p and miR-214-3p) overlapped with the DEMs from solid tumors. Therefore, those miRNAs have the potential to serve as early and sensitive biomarkers for TAA-induced cholangiocarcinoma.

cancer,"PURPOSE: This study reports the long-term outcomes of simultaneous integrated boost radiotherapy (SIB-RT) combined with oral S-1 chemotherapy (CRTCT) in inoperable patients aged >/= 70 years with inoperable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: In this multicenter, phase III randomized trial, patients with inoperable, locally advanced stage II-IV ESCC were randomized to receive either CRTCT or RT alone. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), restricted mean survival time (RMST), and patterns of failure. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 75 months, patients in the CRTCT group had longer OS than those in the RT group (hazard ratio (HR), 0.74; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.57-0.95; P = 0.02), with better 5-year OS rates (34.1 % vs. 23.6 %,P = 0.02), PFS (31.1 % vs. 20.9 %,P = 0.02), and RMST (33.0 vs. 27.0 months,P = 0.02). CRTCT's effect on OS stabilized over 5 years. Locoregional failure was lower in the CRTCT group (HR, 0.64; 95 % CI, 0.45-0.92; P = 0.02), with similar distant and mixed failure risks. CONCLUSIONS: SIB-RT combined with oral S-1 chemotherapy significantly improved long-term survival and therefore might be considered a standard of care for elderly patients with inoperable ESCC.

cancer,"PURPOSE: Precise delineation of genitourinary structures during prostate cancer (PCa) care is critical to optimize treatment delivery while minimizing toxicity and injury. The Prostate and UREthra on MRI (PURE-MRI) study is an international, prospective study to assess physicians' accuracy segmenting prostate and urethra on MRI. METHODS: Physicians who diagnose or treat PCa were invited to contour prostate and urethra on patient cases using standard T(2)-weighted MRI (all planes). We compared these contours to reference consensus segmentations produced by a multidisciplinary panel of experts. We also evaluated performance of validated auto-segmentation AI tools. Accuracy was assessed with spatial and volumetric analyses. A mixed effects model was used to evaluate potential factors influencing contour performance. RESULTS: 62 specialists from 11 countries created 114 prostate and 110 urethra contours. Prostate median (min, max) accuracy for physicians [vs. AI] was Dice: 0.92 (0.62, 0.95) [vs. 0.95 (0.94, 0.96)], maximum deviation inside prostate: 3.4 mm (1.0, 12.4) [vs. 3.0 mm (3.0, 3.0)], maximum deviation beyond prostate: 5.3 mm (2.4, 17.3) [vs. 3.9 mm (3.1, 4.9)], mean deviation (per case) from the reference prostate: 1.6 mm (0.9, 3.9) [vs. 1.2 mm (1.1, 1.6)]. Urethra accuracy was Dice: 0.33 (0.03, 0.69) [vs. 0.41 (0.35, 0.48)], coverage: 36 % (3 %, 96 %) [vs. 81 % (80 %, 91 %)], maximum (2D) deviation beyond urethra: 1.6 mm (1.0, 2.3) [vs. 1.8 mm (1.3, 2.1)]. CONCLUSION: Physicians contour the prostate on MRI with overall Dice >0.9, though typical cases still include at least one error >5 mm and sometimes >10 mm. Physician urethra contours were less accurate, with typical coverage of <40 % of the reference urethra (compared to >80 % for AI). Physician trainees performed similarly to experienced clinicians. AI tools give comparable accuracy to practicing physicians for prostate contours and achieve better coverage of the urethra.",purpos precis delin genitourinari structur prostat cancer pca care critic optim treatment deliveri minim toxic injuri prostat urethra mri puremri studi intern prospect studi assess physician accuraci segment prostat urethra mri method physician diagnos treat pca invit contour prostat urethra patient case use standard t2weight mri plane compar contour refer consensu segment produc multidisciplinari panel expert also evalu perform valid autosegment ai tool accuraci assess spatial volumetr analys mix effect model use evalu potenti factor influenc contour perform result 62 specialist 11 countri creat 114 prostat 110 urethra contour prostat median min max accuraci physician vs ai dice 092 062 095 vs 095 094 096 maximum deviat insid prostat 34 mm 10 124 vs 30 mm 30 30 maximum deviat beyond prostat 53 mm 24 173 vs 39 mm 31 49 mean deviat per case refer prostat 16 mm 09 39 vs 12 mm 11 16 urethra accuraci dice 033 003 069 vs 041 035 048 coverag 36 3 96 vs 81 80 91 maximum 2d deviat beyond urethra 16 mm 10 23 vs 18 mm 13 21 conclus physician contour prostat mri overal dice 09 though typic case still includ least one error 5 mm sometim 10 mm physician urethra contour less accur typic coverag 40 refer urethra compar 80 ai physician traine perform similarli experienc clinician ai tool give compar accuraci practic physician prostat contour achiev better coverag urethra
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) is part of the human skin virome. Like other HPyVs, it encodes proteins with oncogenic properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 73-year-old Italian female patient with stage II right-sided colon adenocarcinoma underwent hemicolectomy; she died one month later because of bacterial sepsis. Colon tumor (T), adjacent healthy (AH) tissue, and serum samples were collected. Total nucleic acids were subjected to next-generation sequencing, followed by metagenomics analysis. HPyV detection was confirmed by real-time PCR and Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA); HPyV6 transcripts and proteins were identified by means of PCR and Western blot/mass spectrometry, respectively. RESULTS: Viral metagenomics analysis revealed the presence of several viral genomes, mainly belonging to unclassified viruses and phages, in both AH and T tissues. HPyV6 DNA was detected in the T tissue, representing 7 % of the viral sequences, but not in the AH tissue. Subsequent molecular analysis confirmed the presence of the HPyV6 genomes (3.3x10(6)copies/ug) as episomes, infecting 19.8 % of the tumor cells; LT-Ag and VP1 transcripts were expressed in the T tissue, and the LT-Ag protein was expressed twice as highly in the T tissue as in the AH tissue. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the differential presence and expression of the HPyV6 genome in colon tumors but not in the AH tissue. These results are indicative of ongoing active replication of the virus, which might play a triggering role in malignant transformation.",introduct human polyomaviru 6 hpyv6 part human skin virom like hpyv encod protein oncogen properti materi method 73yearold italian femal patient stage ii rightsid colon adenocarcinoma underw hemicolectomi die one month later bacteri sepsi colon tumor adjac healthi ah tissu serum sampl collect total nucleic acid subject nextgener sequenc follow metagenom analysi hpyv detect confirm realtim pcr roll circl amplif rca hpyv6 transcript protein identifi mean pcr western blotmass spectrometri respect result viral metagenom analysi reveal presenc sever viral genom mainli belong unclassifi virus phage ah tissu hpyv6 dna detect tissu repres 7 viral sequenc ah tissu subsequ molecular analysi confirm presenc hpyv6 genom 33x106copiesug episom infect 198 tumor cell ltag vp1 transcript express tissu ltag protein express twice highli tissu ah tissu conclus first report differenti presenc express hpyv6 genom colon tumor ah tissu result indic ongo activ replic viru might play trigger role malign transform
cancer,"This study aimed to develop and evaluate polymeric mixed micelles for the oral delivery of Fulvestrant (FVT), with or without Quercetin (QUE), using Soluplus(R) and Pluronic(R) F127. Among the tested weight ratios, 75:25 micelles exhibited optimal properties, including average particle sizes below 200 nm, a narrow size distribution (PDI < 0.2), high drug loading (8-8.7 %), and encapsulation efficiency > 90 %. The optimized formulations (FVT-MM and FVT-QUE-MM) showed spherical morphology, stability over 15 days, and sustained FVT release without an initial burst. In vitro, these formulations preserved the antiproliferative activity of FVT against MCF-7 cells after 72 h of treatment and maintained high cytocompatibility in Caco-2 cells (>90 %). Ex vivo Franz diffusion studies with porcine intestine revealed enhanced FVT permeation for FVT-QUE-MM ( approximately 1.8-fold vs. FVT-MM). Both formulations also inhibited MCF-7 cell adhesion to fibronectin and migration, with stronger effects observed for FVT-QUE-MM. Oral pharmacokinetic studies in rats demonstrated significantly increased relative FVT bioavailability for FVT-MM (2.85- fold) and FVT-QUE-MM (3.71-fold) compared to FVT suspension. These findings suggest that Soluplus(R)/Pluronic(R) F127 micelles, particularly those co-loaded with QUE, represent a promising strategy to improve the oral delivery and therapeutic efficacy of FVT.",studi aim develop evalu polymer mix micel oral deliveri fulvestr fvt without quercetin que use soluplusr pluronicr f127 among test weight ratio 7525 micel exhibit optim properti includ averag particl size 200 nm narrow size distribut pdi 02 high drug load 887 encapsul effici 90 optim formul fvtmm fvtquemm show spheric morpholog stabil 15 day sustain fvt releas without initi burst vitro formul preserv antiprolif activ fvt mcf7 cell 72 h treatment maintain high cytocompat caco2 cell 90 ex vivo franz diffus studi porcin intestin reveal enhanc fvt permeat fvtquemm approxim 18fold vs fvtmm formul also inhibit mcf7 cell adhes fibronectin migrat stronger effect observ fvtquemm oral pharmacokinet studi rat demonstr significantli increas rel fvt bioavail fvtmm 285 fold fvtquemm 371fold compar fvt suspens find suggest soluplusrpluronicr f127 micel particularli coload que repres promis strategi improv oral deliveri therapeut efficaci fvt
cancer,"Autophagy is a degradative process for recycling and breaking down cellular components, with several context-dependent functions in the development of tumors and resistance to therapy. Numerous clinical trials aiming to target autophagy in different tumors have been initiated as indicated by encouraging results from diverse preclinical investigations. Research on the connection between autophagosomes and the prognosis of different malignancies is now underway. The autophagy machinery itself may serve as a source of biomarkers for this purpose. Numerous research studies have established the association between autophagy-related genes (ATGs) and proteins (Atgs) in diverse types of cancer. Nonetheless, the outcomes of this association are still uncertain and the validation of reliable autophagy-related biomarkers is still lagging behind, owing to the paradoxical roles of autophagy in tumor biology and the scarcity of primary research studies. Herein, we explore recent developments, issues, and trends in the evaluation of clinically significant ATGs' and their encoded proteins' biomarker potential in human malignancies.",autophagi degrad process recycl break cellular compon sever contextdepend function develop tumor resist therapi numer clinic trial aim target autophagi differ tumor initi indic encourag result divers preclin investig research connect autophagosom prognosi differ malign underway autophagi machineri may serv sourc biomark purpos numer research studi establish associ autophagyrel gene atg protein atg divers type cancer nonetheless outcom associ still uncertain valid reliabl autophagyrel biomark still lag behind owe paradox role autophagi tumor biolog scarciti primari research studi herein explor recent develop issu trend evalu clinic signific atg encod protein biomark potenti human malign
cancer,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Accurate polyp measurement is vital for colorectal cancer treatment and surveillance. Traditional methods are often unreliable. The FDA-approved Virtual Scale Endoscopy (VSE) provides real-time, laser-calibrated overlays to improve size measurements. This meta-analysis evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of VSE compared with conventional methods: visual assessment (VA), snare, and biopsy forceps. METHODS: We conducted a pairwise meta-analysis comparing VSE and VA, along with a frequent network meta-analysis (NMA) assessing VSE, VA, snare, and forceps retrieved from PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Embase, WPRIM, and Scopus until January 2025. Risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) were computed with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). SUCRA analysis ranked interventions. PROSPERO ID: CRD420251024644 RESULTS: Eleven studies were included, comprising 1,581 polyps across six clinical and five pre-clinical studies. In pairwise analysis, VSE significantly improved measurement accuracy compared to VA (MD 14.52%; 95% CI [10.35-18.70]) and reduced total misclassifications (54.3% vs 73.6%; RR 0.64; 95% CI [0.42-0.97]). In clinical subgroups, VSE markedly reduced overestimation rates (22.5% vs 41.5%; RR 0.52; 95% CI [0.44-0.63]). NMA confirmed VSE as the top-ranked modality for minimizing total misclassification (SUCRA 100%), outperforming snare, forceps, and VA. No overall differences were detected in total over- or underestimation. CONCLUSIONS: VSE significantly improves polyp sizing accuracy compared to VA, snare, and forceps across both clinical and pre-clinical settings. NMA supports VSE as the top-ranking modality, suggesting its potential to enhance decision-making in polypectomy and surveillance. Larger multi-center trials are needed for validation.",background aim accur polyp measur vital colorect cancer treatment surveil tradit method often unreli fdaapprov virtual scale endoscopi vse provid realtim lasercalibr overlay improv size measur metaanalysi evalu diagnost accuraci vse compar convent method visual assess va snare biopsi forcep method conduct pairwis metaanalysi compar vse va along frequent network metaanalysi nma assess vse va snare forcep retriev pubm cochran web scienc embas wprim scopu januari 2025 risk ratio rr mean differ md comput 95 confid interv ci sucra analysi rank intervent prospero id crd420251024644 result eleven studi includ compris 1581 polyp across six clinic five preclin studi pairwis analysi vse significantli improv measur accuraci compar va md 1452 95 ci 10351870 reduc total misclassif 543 vs 736 rr 064 95 ci 042097 clinic subgroup vse markedli reduc overestim rate 225 vs 415 rr 052 95 ci 044063 nma confirm vse toprank modal minim total misclassif sucra 100 outperform snare forcep va overal differ detect total underestim conclus vse significantli improv polyp size accuraci compar va snare forcep across clinic preclin set nma support vse toprank modal suggest potenti enhanc decisionmak polypectomi surveil larger multicent trial need valid
cancer,"Cancer is a complex dissipative system operating far from equilibrium, characterized by increased entropy production compared to normal tissues. Traditional thermodynamic approaches often fail to capture its full dynamics. In this study, we apply non-equilibrium stochastic thermodynamics to analyze different stages of carcinogenesis: neoplastic transformation (using the Avrami-Dobrzynski approach), tumor growth (described by the Gompertz model), and metastasis, in relation to tumor entropy and self-organization. Our results reveal a relationship between entropy production and tumor expansion rate, indicating that cellular reproduction enhances entropy generation. We also examine the information entropy of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that restricting external energy intake does not halt tumor progression, underscoring the resilience of cancer as an autonomous physical system. These findings highlight the thermodynamic nature of cancer and suggest that metastasis is an inevitable consequence of entropy-driven evolution.",cancer complex dissip system oper far equilibrium character increas entropi product compar normal tissu tradit thermodynam approach often fail captur full dynam studi appli nonequilibrium stochast thermodynam analyz differ stage carcinogenesi neoplast transform use avramidobrzynski approach tumor growth describ gompertz model metastasi relat tumor entropi selforgan result reveal relationship entropi product tumor expans rate indic cellular reproduct enhanc entropi gener also examin inform entropi hepatocellular carcinoma cell furthermor demonstr restrict extern energi intak halt tumor progress underscor resili cancer autonom physic system find highlight thermodynam natur cancer suggest metastasi inevit consequ entropydriven evolut
cancer,"Living near green areas with high vegetation may contribute to an active lifestyle, stress reduction, and enhance social cohesion, and consequently may be associated with improved cancer survival. Epidemiologic studies focused on greenness exposure and cancer-specific mortality, specifically colorectal cancer (CRC)-specific mortality, are sparse. We examined the association between residential greenness at diagnosis and CRC-specific mortality. Using the Kentucky Cancer Registry database, 35,868 primary CRC cases diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2018 were followed until death or November 2020. Residential greenness exposure at diagnosis was estimated using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with 270m and 1230m buffers. Using Cox models, we estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of CRC-specific mortality and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by quartiles of greenness. We assessed effect modification using the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT). We observed 9,805 CRC-specific deaths over 208,098 person-years of follow-up. While crude assessments suggested an inverse relationship between NDVI quartiles and CRC-specific mortality, the association was null after adjustment for individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics (270m Buffer aHR Quartile 4 versus Quartile 1: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.95, 1.08, p-trend = 0.65; 1230m Buffer aHR Quartile 4 versus Quartile 1: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.10, p-trend = 0.26). No effect modification was observed by urban/rural status, race, or neighborhood-level income, while modification by stage was observed for the 270m buffer (LRT p-value = 0.03). Our findings suggest that residing in greener areas was not associated with CRC-specific mortality. Future studies should consider additional greenness measures, greenness interactions, and residential changes over follow-up.",live near green area high veget may contribut activ lifestyl stress reduct enhanc social cohes consequ may associ improv cancer surviv epidemiolog studi focus green exposur cancerspecif mortal specif colorect cancer crcspecif mortal spars examin associ residenti green diagnosi crcspecif mortal use kentucki cancer registri databas 35868 primari crc case diagnos januari 2000 decemb 2018 follow death novemb 2020 residenti green exposur diagnosi estim use normal differ veget index ndvi 270m 1230m buffer use cox model estim adjust hazard ratio ahr crcspecif mortal 95 confid interv ci quartil green assess effect modif use likelihood ratio test lrt observ 9805 crcspecif death 208098 personyear followup crude assess suggest invers relationship ndvi quartil crcspecif mortal associ null adjust individu neighborhoodlevel characterist 270m buffer ahr quartil 4 versu quartil 1 101 95 ci 095 108 ptrend 065 1230m buffer ahr quartil 4 versu quartil 1 103 95 ci 096 110 ptrend 026 effect modif observ urbanrur statu race neighborhoodlevel incom modif stage observ 270m buffer lrt pvalu 003 find suggest resid greener area associ crcspecif mortal futur studi consid addit green measur green interact residenti chang followup
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer (LC) after lung transplantation (LTx) is a rare but severe complication whose treatment and outcomes remain unclear. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective observational cohort study included consecutive patients diagnosed between 2000-2023 with primary LC after LTx or heart-LTx. Patient characteristics, cancer stage, treatment modalities, and outcomes were analyzed. Survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods. We compared the cohort to control recipients without post-transplantation LC. RESULTS: Of 7313 recipients, 143 (2%) developed LC, after a median interval of 5.3 years. Fifty-five cancers (37%) were stage I disease and 53 (35%) metastatic disease. In 60 (42%) patients, curative-intent surgery, predominantly via a thoracotomy (79%) was performed and achieved R0 resection in 53/57 (93%) patients. Day-90 mortality was 5% after lobectomy and 33% after pneumonectomy. Of the 31 (21%) patients given curative-intent radiotherapy, three developed radiation-induced grade 3 or 4 lung toxicity. Median overall survival in patients with stage I, II, III, and IV disease was 83, 16, 10, and 6 months, respectively. Compared to controls, patients with LC were older at transplantation, had greater donor and recipient smoking exposure, and more often received single-LTx (43% vs. 16%). Of the 62 single-LTx recipients, 52 (84%) had LC in the native lung. CONCLUSIONS: Curative-intent surgical resection, when avoiding pneumonectomy, and radiotherapy yield good long-term survival in early-stage post-transplantation LC. The dramatic survival differences between early and advanced stages emphasize the critical importance of routine low-dose computed tomography screening in all recipients, notably after single-LTx.",background lung cancer lc lung transplant ltx rare sever complic whose treatment outcom remain unclear method multicent retrospect observ cohort studi includ consecut patient diagnos 20002023 primari lc ltx heartltx patient characterist cancer stage treatment modal outcom analyz surviv assess use kaplanmei method compar cohort control recipi without posttransplant lc result 7313 recipi 143 2 develop lc median interv 53 year fiftyf cancer 37 stage diseas 53 35 metastat diseas 60 42 patient curativeint surgeri predominantli via thoracotomi 79 perform achiev r0 resect 5357 93 patient day90 mortal 5 lobectomi 33 pneumonectomi 31 21 patient given curativeint radiotherapi three develop radiationinduc grade 3 4 lung toxic median overal surviv patient stage ii iii iv diseas 83 16 10 6 month respect compar control patient lc older transplant greater donor recipi smoke exposur often receiv singleltx 43 vs 16 62 singleltx recipi 52 84 lc nativ lung conclus curativeint surgic resect avoid pneumonectomi radiotherapi yield good longterm surviv earlystag posttransplant lc dramat surviv differ earli advanc stage emphas critic import routin lowdos comput tomographi screen recipi notabl singleltx
cancer,"Surgical pathology reports provide essential diagnostic information critical for cancer staging, treatment planning, and cancer registry documentation. However, their writing styles and formats vary widely, reflecting each pathologist's stylistic choices, institutional norms, and inherited practices from residency training. When performing large-scale data analysis, this unstructured nature and variability across tumor types and institutions pose significant hurdles for automated data extraction. To overcome these challenges, we present a consensus-driven, reasoning-based framework that adapts multiple locally deployed large language models (LLMs) to extract both standard diagnostic variables (site, laterality, histology, stage, grade, and behavior) and organ-specific biomarkers. Each LLM generates structured outputs, accompanied by justifications, which are subsequently evaluated for accuracy and coherence by three separate reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1-large, Qwen3-32B, and QWQ-32B). Final consensus values are determined through aggregation. Board-certified pathologists conducted expert validation. This framework was applied to over 6,100 pathology reports from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) spanning 10 organ systems and 510 reports from Moffitt Cancer Center. For the TCGA dataset, automated evaluation demonstrated mean accuracy of 84.9%+/-7.3%, with histology (88%), site (87%), stage and behavior (84%) showing the highest extraction accuracy averaged across all models. Expert review of randomly selected 138 reports confirmed high agreement for behavior (100.0%), histology (99%), grade (96%), and site (95%) in the TCGA dataset, with slightly lower performance for stage (89%) and laterality (88%). In Moffitt Cancer Center reports (brain, breast, and lung), accuracy remained high (88.2%+/-7.2%), with behavior (99%), histology (97%), laterality (96%), grade (94%), and site (93%) achieving strong agreement. Biomarker extraction achieved 70.6%+/-7.9% overall accuracy, with TP53 (84%) on brain tumor, Ki-67 (68%) on breast cancer, and ROS1 (82%) on lung cancer showing highest accuracy. Inter-evaluator agreement analysis revealed high concordance (correlations >/= 0.93) across the three evaluation models. Statistical analyses revealed significant main effects of model type (F=1716.82, p<0.001), variable (F=3236.68, p<0.001), and organ system (F=1946.43, p<0.001), as well as model x variable x organ interactions (F=24.74, p<0.001), emphasizing the role of clinical context in model performance. These results highlight the potential of stratified, multi-organ evaluation frameworks with multi-evaluator consensus in LLM benchmarking for clinical applications. Overall, this consensus-based approach demonstrates that locally deployed LLMs can provide a transparent, accurate, and auditable solution for integration into real-world pathology workflows such as synoptic reporting and cancer registry abstraction.",surgic patholog report provid essenti diagnost inform critic cancer stage treatment plan cancer registri document howev write style format vari wide reflect pathologist stylist choic institut norm inherit practic resid train perform largescal data analysi unstructur natur variabl across tumor type institut pose signific hurdl autom data extract overcom challeng present consensusdriven reasoningbas framework adapt multipl local deploy larg languag model llm extract standard diagnost variabl site later histolog stage grade behavior organspecif biomark llm gener structur output accompani justif subsequ evalu accuraci coher three separ reason model deepseekr1larg qwen332b qwq32b final consensu valu determin aggreg boardcertifi pathologist conduct expert valid framework appli 6100 patholog report cancer genom atla tcga span 10 organ system 510 report moffitt cancer center tcga dataset autom evalu demonstr mean accuraci 84973 histolog 88 site 87 stage behavior 84 show highest extract accuraci averag across model expert review randomli select 138 report confirm high agreement behavior 1000 histolog 99 grade 96 site 95 tcga dataset slightli lower perform stage 89 later 88 moffitt cancer center report brain breast lung accuraci remain high 88272 behavior 99 histolog 97 later 96 grade 94 site 93 achiev strong agreement biomark extract achiev 70679 overal accuraci tp53 84 brain tumor ki67 68 breast cancer ros1 82 lung cancer show highest accuraci interevalu agreement analysi reveal high concord correl 093 across three evalu model statist analys reveal signific main effect model type f171682 p0001 variabl f323668 p0001 organ system f194643 p0001 well model x variabl x organ interact f2474 p0001 emphas role clinic context model perform result highlight potenti stratifi multiorgan evalu framework multievalu consensu llm benchmark clinic applic overal consensusbas approach demonstr local deploy llm provid transpar accur audit solut integr realworld patholog workflow synopt report cancer registri abstract
cancer,"Long-standing diabetes mellitus (long-DM) (> 3 years) is associated with worse clinical outcomes in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic alterations may contribute to this association; however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the role of the tumor-suppressive long non-coding RNA MEG3 and related molecules in the development of PDAC with long-DM. A total of 117 patients who underwent surgical resection for PDAC at Hirosaki University Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Histopathological assessment followed WHO criteria and the Union for International Cancer Control tumor-node-metastasis classification. Promoter methylation of MEG3 was assessed via methylation-specific PCR using formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue. MEG3 expression levels were measured by qPCR. Additionally, proteomic profiling was performed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue samples. Among the 117 PDAC cases, patients with long-DM exhibited significantly poorer tumor differentiation and reduced cancer-specific survival. MEG3 promoter methylation was more prevalent in patients with long-DM. MEG3 methylation was correlated with reduced MEG3 expression, increased venous invasion, higher recurrence rates, and worse prognosis. Proteomic analysis and protein structure prediction tool revealed F11R as a potential downstream effector of MEG3. F11R protein expression levels were evaluated using semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry. Higher F11R expression was observed in long-DM patients correlating with poorly histological differentiation and unfavorable outcomes. PDAC patients showing simultaneous MEG3 methylation and F11R high expression were more likely to have long-DM, with additive effects of these changes and tumor recurrence. Our results demonstrated that MEG3 and its potential downstream regulator, F11R could be involved in PDAC progression, particularly in patients with long-DM. The findings underscore the clinical significance of epigenetic regulation in DM-related PDAC, suggesting novel targets such as MEG3 and F11R for potential therapeutic intervention.",longstand diabet mellitu longdm 3 year associ wors clinic outcom patient pancreat ductal adenocarcinoma pdac emerg evid suggest epigenet alter may contribut associ howev underli mechan remain larg unclear studi aim elucid role tumorsuppress long noncod rna meg3 relat molecul develop pdac longdm total 117 patient underw surgic resect pdac hirosaki univers hospit retrospect analyz histopatholog assess follow criteria union intern cancer control tumornodemetastasi classif promot methyl meg3 assess via methylationspecif pcr use formalin fix paraffin embed tissu meg3 express level measur qpcr addit proteom profil perform use liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometri formalin fix paraffin embed tissu sampl among 117 pdac case patient longdm exhibit significantli poorer tumor differenti reduc cancerspecif surviv meg3 promot methyl preval patient longdm meg3 methyl correl reduc meg3 express increas venou invas higher recurr rate wors prognosi proteom analysi protein structur predict tool reveal f11r potenti downstream effector meg3 f11r protein express level evalu use semiquantit immunohistochemistri higher f11r express observ longdm patient correl poorli histolog differenti unfavor outcom pdac patient show simultan meg3 methyl f11r high express like longdm addit effect chang tumor recurr result demonstr meg3 potenti downstream regul f11r could involv pdac progress particularli patient longdm find underscor clinic signific epigenet regul dmrelat pdac suggest novel target meg3 f11r potenti therapeut intervent
cancer,"BACKGROUND: The ability of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) to predict overall survival (OS) outcomes in cancer trials is matter of debate. Herein, we investigated whether PFS and ORR predicted OS results in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in advanced NSCLC. METHODS: ORR (OR(ORR),%ORR), OS (HR(OS),mOS) and PFS (HR(PFS),mPFS) data were collected from phase III RCTs investigating ICIs in advanced NSCLC. Linear regression, weighted by sample size, between surrogate endpoints and OS were calculated. The power of correlation was defined by the value of coefficient of determination R(2) (>/=0.7 strong, 0.69-0.50 moderate, <0.5 weak). RESULTS: Forty investigational arms of ICIs +/- chemotherapy (ChT) were identified for further investigation. Arm-level analysis revealed that mPFS had a strong correlation with mOS in all comparisons (R(2)=0.71), in ICIs+ChT trials (R(2)=0.81) and in first-line setting (R(2)=0.71). A weak correlation was found between mPFS-mOS (R(2)=0.48) in trials of ICIs without chemotherapy. Next, trial-level analysis revealed a weak correlation between HR(OS) and HR(PFS) in all different groups, except in ICIs+ChT trial (R(2)=0.60). In addition, based on arm-level analysis, mOS and %ORR had moderate correlation in all comparisons (R(2)=0.58), in ICIs+ChT (R(2)=0.58) or ICIs (R(2)=0.53). In trial-level analysis, OR(ORR) and HR(OS) had moderate correlation (R(2)=0.55) in first-line setting and a strong correlation in ICIs+ChT trials (R(2)=0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Across trials investigating ICIs in advanced NSCLC, PFS and ORR demonstrated various degrees of relationship with OS. Caution should be taken when efficacy of novel ICIs regimens is evaluated only using surrogate outcomes.",background abil progressionfre surviv pf overal respons rate orr predict overal surviv os outcom cancer trial matter debat herein investig whether pf orr predict os result random clinic trial rct test immun checkpoint inhibitor ici advanc nsclc method orr ororrorr os hrosmo pf hrpfsmpf data collect phase iii rct investig ici advanc nsclc linear regress weight sampl size surrog endpoint os calcul power correl defin valu coeffici determin r2 07 strong 069050 moder 05 weak result forti investig arm ici chemotherapi cht identifi investig armlevel analysi reveal mpf strong correl mo comparison r2071 icischt trial r2081 firstlin set r2071 weak correl found mpfsmo r2048 trial ici without chemotherapi next triallevel analysi reveal weak correl hro hrpf differ group except icischt trial r2060 addit base armlevel analysi mo orr moder correl comparison r2058 icischt r2058 ici r2053 triallevel analysi ororr hro moder correl r2055 firstlin set strong correl icischt trial r2079 conclus across trial investig ici advanc nsclc pf orr demonstr variou degre relationship os caution taken efficaci novel ici regimen evalu use surrog outcom
cancer,"Cervical cancer (CC) is the fourth most common malignancy among women worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for improved predictive, diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to enhance disease management and patient outcomes. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), perform various functions in transcriptional, translational and post-translational regulation. Aberrant expression of ncRNAs in CC has been closely associated with disease initiation and progression, underscoring their potential as key regulators of cervical tumorigenesis. Several lncRNAs, such as HOTAIR and PVT1, contribute to cervical tumorigenesis by promoting cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Likewise, circRNAs, such as circ_0018289, act as miRNA sponges, leading to the dysregulation of key target genes. Moreover, specific miRNAs, such as miR-20a and miR-21, promote CC progression (oncogenic miRNAs), whereas others, including miR-214 and miR-218, exhibit a tumor suppressor role. Importantly, many ncRNAs are detectable in body fluids, representing stable and minimally invasive biomarkers suitable for liquid biopsy. Thus, in this comprehensive narrative review, we map the range of candidate ncRNAs reported in the literature and discuss their predictive, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value, including their potential as circulating biomarkers in CC. We also highlight, as a future perspective, how integrated profiling approaches could guide research and support the development of non-invasive strategies for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, and therapy monitoring in CC.",cervic cancer cc fourth common malign among women worldwid highlight urgent need improv predict diagnost prognost biomark enhanc diseas manag patient outcom noncod rna ncrna includ long noncod rna lncrna circular rna circrna microrna mirna perform variou function transcript translat posttransl regul aberr express ncrna cc close associ diseas initi progress underscor potenti key regul cervic tumorigenesi sever lncrna hotair pvt1 contribut cervic tumorigenesi promot cell prolifer migrat invas likewis circrna circ0018289 act mirna spong lead dysregul key target gene moreov specif mirna mir20a mir21 promot cc progress oncogen mirna wherea other includ mir214 mir218 exhibit tumor suppressor role importantli mani ncrna detect bodi fluid repres stabl minim invas biomark suitabl liquid biopsi thu comprehens narr review map rang candid ncrna report literatur discuss predict diagnost prognost therapeut valu includ potenti circul biomark cc also highlight futur perspect integr profil approach could guid research support develop noninvas strategi diagnosi prognost assess therapi monitor cc
cancer,"Despite therapeutic advancements in the management of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC), there is an unmet clinical need for patient-specific in vitro models that can predict responses to therapy and enhance our understanding of this heterogeneous disease. Here, we established biomimetic 3D in vitro models, termed tumouroids, that incorporate patient-derived tumour cells and a complex stroma to mimic the physiological tumour microenvironment. We isolated tumour cells from RCC surgical specimens (n=20) using a mechanical-enzymatic method. Two tumouroid types were manufactured: simple tumouroids consisting of patient-derived tumour cells, collagen and matrix proteins, and complex tumouroids that incorporated an additional stromal compartment populated with fibroblasts and endothelial cells. An important feature of tumouroids is that owing to fabrication via plastic compression their density mimics in vivo physiological tissue density. Patient-derived cells and tumouroids were characterised through immunofluorescence and histology to investigate resemblance to original tissues. Finally, tumouroids were subjected to treatment with Pazopanib (Votrient), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used in the treatment of advanced RCC. Patient-derived tumouroids maintained the expression of characteristic RCC protein markers: carbonic anydrase IX (CA9), cytokeratins (CK7, CK8&18) and EMT markers (alphaSMA). The subtype-specific histology of the original tumour, e.g., clear cell, was also preserved. We observed Pazopanib-induced cytotoxicity, as measured by ATP production, ranging from none to strong (40%) for individual patient-derived simple tumouroids (n=12). In complex tumouroids, endothelial networks were also disrupted. Overall, patient-derived tumouroids mimicked the original tissue and successfully reproduced the response signatures to TKIs. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: A significant number of renal cell carcinoma patients do not respond to targeted therapies or develop resistance and succumb to the disease. Here, we developed sophisticated 3D in vitro tumour models, termed tumouroids, from patient samples. Tumouroids mimic the original tumour and its microenvironment and elicit response to drugs that target both the tumour cells and the tumour microenvironment. This is a patient-specific in vitro tool that addresses the unmet clinical need for predicting an individual's response to therapy.",despit therapeut advanc manag renal cell carcinoma rcc unmet clinic need patientspecif vitro model predict respons therapi enhanc understand heterogen diseas establish biomimet 3d vitro model term tumouroid incorpor patientderiv tumour cell complex stroma mimic physiolog tumour microenviron isol tumour cell rcc surgic specimen n20 use mechanicalenzymat method two tumouroid type manufactur simpl tumouroid consist patientderiv tumour cell collagen matrix protein complex tumouroid incorpor addit stromal compart popul fibroblast endotheli cell import featur tumouroid owe fabric via plastic compress densiti mimic vivo physiolog tissu densiti patientderiv cell tumouroid characteris immunofluoresc histolog investig resembl origin tissu final tumouroid subject treatment pazopanib votrient tyrosin kinas inhibitor tki use treatment advanc rcc patientderiv tumouroid maintain express characterist rcc protein marker carbon anydras ix ca9 cytokeratin ck7 ck818 emt marker alphasma subtypespecif histolog origin tumour eg clear cell also preserv observ pazopanibinduc cytotox measur atp product rang none strong 40 individu patientderiv simpl tumouroid n12 complex tumouroid endotheli network also disrupt overal patientderiv tumouroid mimick origin tissu success reproduc respons signatur tki statement signific signific number renal cell carcinoma patient respond target therapi develop resist succumb diseas develop sophist 3d vitro tumour model term tumouroid patient sampl tumouroid mimic origin tumour microenviron elicit respons drug target tumour cell tumour microenviron patientspecif vitro tool address unmet clinic need predict individu respons therapi
cancer,"X-ray-induced photodynamic therapy (X-PDT) shows significant promise in tumor treatments due to its unlimited tissue penetration but requires delivering sensitizers to tumors. Here, we engineered photosensitizer verteporfin (VP) and T-lymphokine-activated killer cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) inhibitor OTS964-encapsulated polymeric nanocarriers (VP/OTS964@NPs) for effective tumor X-PDT, molecule-targeted therapy and inducing robust antitumor immunity for synergistic immunotherapy of low immunogenic breast tumors and their lung metastases when combined with PD-L1 blockade. The VP/OTS964@NPs are monodisperse and can be disassembled to release drugs in response to high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the tumor microenvironment or generated during X-PDT. It can efficiently deliver drugs into the TOPK-high expression breast cancer cells, generate ROS and induce ICD effects. By i.v. injection, VP/OTS964@NPs efficiently accumulated in the breast tumors and effectively eradicated tumors upon X-PDT. Additionally, the VP/OTS964@NPs activated the systemic antitumor immune responses, significantly inhibited the distant breast tumors and the lung metastasis of breast tumors, and enhanced the survival rates in combination with PD-L1 blockade. This study presented a strategy for engineering nanocarriers for synergistic molecular therapy, tumor XDT and immunotherapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: X-PDT is a promising therapeutic modality for cancer treatment. However, its clinical application is hindered by the limited availability of suitable sensitizers and their insufficient tumor-targeting capability. This work aims to construct ROS-sensitive nanocarriers co-loaded with the photosensitizer verteporfin and the TOPK inhibitor OTS964 to achieve synergistic X-PDT for triple-negative breast cancer. By further activating antitumor immune responses, this strategy is designed to suppress the distant and metastatic breast tumors. Overall, this work provides both a nanodrug platform and a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of poorly immunogenic solid tumors.",xrayinduc photodynam therapi xpdt show signific promis tumor treatment due unlimit tissu penetr requir deliv sensit tumor engin photosensit verteporfin vp tlymphokineactiv killer cellorigin protein kinas topk inhibitor ots964encapsul polymer nanocarri vpots964np effect tumor xpdt moleculetarget therapi induc robust antitumor immun synergist immunotherapi low immunogen breast tumor lung metastas combin pdl1 blockad vpots964np monodispers disassembl releas drug respons high reactiv oxygen speci ro level tumor microenviron gener xpdt effici deliv drug topkhigh express breast cancer cell gener ro induc icd effect iv inject vpots964np effici accumul breast tumor effect erad tumor upon xpdt addit vpots964np activ system antitumor immun respons significantli inhibit distant breast tumor lung metastasi breast tumor enhanc surviv rate combin pdl1 blockad studi present strategi engin nanocarri synergist molecular therapi tumor xdt immunotherapi statement signific xpdt promis therapeut modal cancer treatment howev clinic applic hinder limit avail suitabl sensit insuffici tumortarget capabl work aim construct rossensit nanocarri coload photosensit verteporfin topk inhibitor ots964 achiev synergist xpdt tripleneg breast cancer activ antitumor immun respons strategi design suppress distant metastat breast tumor overal work provid nanodrug platform therapeut strategi treatment poorli immunogen solid tumor
cancer,"Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines have become a transformative approach in immunotherapy and have attracted significant attention owing to their unprecedented success in controlling COVID-19. With their ability to flexibly and specifically encode tumour-associated antigens, along with their favorable safety profiles and scalable manufacturing, mRNA vaccines represent a highly promising platform for cancer treatment. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and many of its subtypes are immunologically cold tumours, which has limited the progress of immunotherapy in this field. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of mRNA vaccines to reshape the tumour immune microenvironment in breast cancer. These vaccines can enhance antigen presentation, activate T cell responses, and convert immunologically cold tumours into immune-active ones. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in mRNA vaccine development for breast cancer with a focus on antigen selection, mRNA design, and delivery strategies. It also examines findings from both preclinical and clinical studies as well as recent progress in industrial development. Finally, we discuss the current challenges hindering the clinical translation and ethical considerations of mRNA vaccine technology and propose future directions to advance mRNA vaccine-based therapies for breast cancer.",messeng rna mrna vaccin becom transform approach immunotherapi attract signific attent owe unpreced success control covid19 abil flexibl specif encod tumourassoci antigen along favor safeti profil scalabl manufactur mrna vaccin repres highli promis platform cancer treatment breast cancer heterogen diseas mani subtyp immunolog cold tumour limit progress immunotherapi field recent studi highlight potenti mrna vaccin reshap tumour immun microenviron breast cancer vaccin enhanc antigen present activ cell respons convert immunolog cold tumour immuneact one review provid comprehens overview recent advanc mrna vaccin develop breast cancer focu antigen select mrna design deliveri strategi also examin find preclin clinic studi well recent progress industri develop final discuss current challeng hinder clinic translat ethic consider mrna vaccin technolog propos futur direct advanc mrna vaccinebas therapi breast cancer
cancer,"This study investigates the effects of different airway management strategies on perioperative immune cells in patients undergoing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) surgery. A total of 23 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the endotracheal intubation (ETT) group or the supraglottic airway device (SAD) group. Comprehensive mass cytometry analysis was performed on peripheral blood CD45+ cells to evaluate immune cell populations. The SAD group demonstrated significantly reduced consumption of neuromuscular blocking agents and opioid requirements compared to the ETT group, with comparable surgical parameters. Notably, the SAD group showed favorable trends in clinical recovery metrics such as analgesic requirements. The study highlights the impact of airway management techniques on immune function, suggesting that the SAD approach may better preserve immune cell populations during surgery. These findings contribute to understanding the early perioperative immune response in NSCLC patients and may inform clinical practices in anesthesia management.",studi investig effect differ airway manag strategi periop immun cell patient undergo nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc surgeri total 23 patient enrol randomli assign either endotrach intub ett group supraglott airway devic sad group comprehens mass cytometri analysi perform peripher blood cd45 cell evalu immun cell popul sad group demonstr significantli reduc consumpt neuromuscular block agent opioid requir compar ett group compar surgic paramet notabl sad group show favor trend clinic recoveri metric analges requir studi highlight impact airway manag techniqu immun function suggest sad approach may better preserv immun cell popul surgeri find contribut understand earli periop immun respons nsclc patient may inform clinic practic anesthesia manag
cancer,"BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin (DOX) is a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent for treating hematologic malignancies and breast cancer. However, its clinical application is limited by severe cardiotoxicity. Recent studies have suggested that mitochondrial dynamics play a central role in the pathogenesis of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC). This study was designed to evaluate whether ursolic acid (UA) can mitigate DIC and elucidate the underlying mechanisms related to mitochondrial fission and oxidative stress. METHODS: A chronic DOX-induced cardiotoxicity model was established via the intraperitoneal administration of DOX (5 mg/kg/week), while ursolic acid was administered intragastrically (50 mg/kg/day). Echocardiography and histological staining were employed to assess the protective effects of ursolic acid on DOX-induced cardiac injury. RESULTS: Ursolic acid treatment significantly improved cardiac function following DOX exposure. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the amelioration of mitochondrial dysfunction. Western blotting demonstrated that ursolic acid markedly reduced the DOX-induced increase in the level of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) phosphorylated at Ser616 (p-DRP1(S616)), suggesting its role in attenuating excessive mitochondrial fission. Furthermore, co-treatment with Mitochondrial Division Inhibitor 1 (Mdivi-1) further suppressed p-DRP1 (S616) expression, reinforcing the notion that ursolic acid mitigates DIC by inhibiting DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission and oxidative stress. The upstream mechanism was explored, with evidence suggesting that the C5a-C5a1 receptor axis mediates p-DRP1(S616) phosphorylation. Western blot analysis revealed significant upregulation of the C5a and C5a1 receptors in the DIC model. The C5a1 receptor agonist BM213 abolished the protective effects of ursolic acid, indicating that ursolic acid exerts its cardioprotective effect by inhibiting the C5a-C5aR1-DRP1(S616) pathway. CONCLUSION: Ursolic acid confers protection against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by improving mitochondrial function through the inhibition of DRP1-mediated excessive mitochondrial fission and oxidative stress.",background doxorubicin dox commonli use chemotherapeut agent treat hematolog malign breast cancer howev clinic applic limit sever cardiotox recent studi suggest mitochondri dynam play central role pathogenesi doxorubicininduc cardiotox dic studi design evalu whether ursol acid ua mitig dic elucid underli mechan relat mitochondri fission oxid stress method chronic doxinduc cardiotox model establish via intraperiton administr dox 5 mgkgweek ursol acid administ intragastr 50 mgkgday echocardiographi histolog stain employ assess protect effect ursol acid doxinduc cardiac injuri result ursol acid treatment significantli improv cardiac function follow dox exposur immunofluoresc analysi confirm amelior mitochondri dysfunct western blot demonstr ursol acid markedli reduc doxinduc increas level dynaminrel protein 1 drp1 phosphoryl ser616 pdrp1s616 suggest role attenu excess mitochondri fission furthermor cotreat mitochondri divis inhibitor 1 mdivi1 suppress pdrp1 s616 express reinforc notion ursol acid mitig dic inhibit drp1mediat mitochondri fission oxid stress upstream mechan explor evid suggest c5ac5a1 receptor axi mediat pdrp1s616 phosphoryl western blot analysi reveal signific upregul c5a c5a1 receptor dic model c5a1 receptor agonist bm213 abolish protect effect ursol acid indic ursol acid exert cardioprotect effect inhibit c5ac5ar1drp1s616 pathway conclus ursol acid confer protect doxinduc cardiotox improv mitochondri function inhibit drp1mediat excess mitochondri fission oxid stress
cancer,"Ovarian cancer remains one of the most aggressive and fatal gynecologic malignancies, primarily due to its asymptomatic onset, early metastatic potential, frequent resistance to conventional therapies, and the absence of effective tools for early detection and prognostic assessment. As a result, sensitive, specific and minimally invasive biomarkers are urgently needed to enable earlier detection, more accurate prediction of clinical outcomes and ongoing monitoring of therapeutic response. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are endogenous RNA molecules formed by covalent backsplice junctions that render them highly resistant to exonuclease degradation. Many circRNAs serve as competitive endogenous RNAs that sequester microRNAs. This sequestration modulates key oncogenic signaling cascades, ultimately regulating cellular proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Their exceptional stability, measurable abundance in body fluids and distinctive dysregulation in pathological states highlight their potential as both diagnostic and prognostic indicators. In fact, biomarker panels based on circRNA expression have achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.923 for ovarian cancer detection. Individually, specific circRNAs have been shown to correlate with overall survival, histologic grade, tumor burden and other clinicopathologic features. In this review, by surveying all relevant data in major databases without language restrictions, we comprehensively update and analyze the latest molecular and clinical findings on the diagnostic and prognostic value of circRNAs in patients with ovarian cancer.",ovarian cancer remain one aggress fatal gynecolog malign primarili due asymptomat onset earli metastat potenti frequent resist convent therapi absenc effect tool earli detect prognost assess result sensit specif minim invas biomark urgent need enabl earlier detect accur predict clinic outcom ongo monitor therapeut respons circular rna circrna endogen rna molecul form coval backsplic junction render highli resist exonucleas degrad mani circrna serv competit endogen rna sequest microrna sequestr modul key oncogen signal cascad ultim regul cellular prolifer migrat apoptosi except stabil measur abund bodi fluid distinct dysregul patholog state highlight potenti diagnost prognost indic fact biomark panel base circrna express achiev area receiv oper characterist curv 0923 ovarian cancer detect individu specif circrna shown correl overal surviv histolog grade tumor burden clinicopatholog featur review survey relev data major databas without languag restrict comprehens updat analyz latest molecular clinic find diagnost prognost valu circrna patient ovarian cancer
cancer,"The macromolecule COMP -Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein- was originally discovered as an essential regulator of the assembly, integrity and homeostatic remodeling of cartilage tissue ECMs. Later, however, it was found to have a more widespread distribution, to attain different subcellular topographies and play a pivotal role as an integral component of fibrotic and cancer-associated matrices. The homopentameric configuration of COMP remains distinctive within the human proteome and confers to the protein a multivalent functionality exploitable by the cells under physiological and pathological conditions. The structural-functional properties of COMP show limited overlap with those of other members of thrombospondin family and its multifaceted nature extends beyond its function in matrix assembly to embrace signal transducing interactions with the cell surface, the sequestering of signaling molecules, and the binding of components of the immunological/complement system. Mutated chondrocyte variants of COMP and isoforms aberrantly expressed by transformed cells are retained intracellularly to engage interactions with a variety of cytoplasmic molecules and convert the macromolecule from a structural ECM component to a regulator of homeostatic and transformative events. We discuss here how the unique structural traits of COMP may endow it with multifunctionality and explain its active participation in highly diverse biological processes.",macromolecul comp cartilag oligomer matrix protein origin discov essenti regul assembl integr homeostat remodel cartilag tissu ecm later howev found widespread distribut attain differ subcellular topographi play pivot role integr compon fibrot cancerassoci matric homopentamer configur comp remain distinct within human proteom confer protein multival function exploit cell physiolog patholog condit structuralfunct properti comp show limit overlap member thrombospondin famili multifacet natur extend beyond function matrix assembl embrac signal transduc interact cell surfac sequest signal molecul bind compon immunologicalcompl system mutat chondrocyt variant comp isoform aberrantli express transform cell retain intracellularli engag interact varieti cytoplasm molecul convert macromolecul structur ecm compon regul homeostat transform event discuss uniqu structur trait comp may endow multifunction explain activ particip highli divers biolog process
cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the deadliest cancers, ranking third in cancer incidence worldwide. These tumor cells often adopt unique strategies under chemotherapeutic stress to attain a reversible drug-tolerant state and evade cell death. However, the molecular adaptations associated with this transitory emergence of the drug-tolerant state remain elusive. Herein, epigenetic alterations often dictate such reversible dynamic changes, and this study aims to characterize the role of specific epigenetic modifiers governing CRC cell survival under cisplatin exposure and their subsequent relapse. We observed that under cisplatin-stress there is a drastic increase in the histone-repressive mark-H3K27me3, linked to an enhanced expression of EZH2, driving transcriptional inhibition of cell proliferation-associated genes and a proliferative arrest. Interestingly, cisplatin-induced oxidative stress increased the expression of P65 protein, which was found to interact with and regulate EZH2 expression. Quenching of ROS, cisplatin-rescue, or P65 inactivation compromised EZH2 activity, concurrent with a re-initiation of cell proliferation. Interestingly, this reversal to proliferative state was associated with an elevated activity of the histone lysine demethylase-KDM6A. The promoter elements of the proliferative genes were now occupied by KDM6A instead of EZH2. Accordingly, a genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of KDM6A in vitro not only resulted in increased cell death but also prevented emergence of the re-proliferative CRC cells. Furthermore, KDM6A inhibition in combination with cisplatin, resulted in an increased tumor regression in vivo. Our study thus highlights the importance of KDM6A as a therapeutic target in preventing CRC growth and relapse which can have future therapeutic implications.",colorect cancer crc one deadliest cancer rank third cancer incid worldwid tumor cell often adopt uniqu strategi chemotherapeut stress attain revers drugtoler state evad cell death howev molecular adapt associ transitori emerg drugtoler state remain elus herein epigenet alter often dictat revers dynam chang studi aim character role specif epigenet modifi govern crc cell surviv cisplatin exposur subsequ relaps observ cisplatinstress drastic increas histonerepress markh3k27me3 link enhanc express ezh2 drive transcript inhibit cell proliferationassoci gene prolif arrest interestingli cisplatininduc oxid stress increas express p65 protein found interact regul ezh2 express quench ro cisplatinrescu p65 inactiv compromis ezh2 activ concurr reiniti cell prolifer interestingli revers prolif state associ elev activ histon lysin demethylasekdm6a promot element prolif gene occupi kdm6a instead ezh2 accordingli genet knockdown pharmacolog inhibit kdm6a vitro result increas cell death also prevent emerg reprolif crc cell furthermor kdm6a inhibit combin cisplatin result increas tumor regress vivo studi thu highlight import kdm6a therapeut target prevent crc growth relaps futur therapeut implic

Recently, the emergence of biomimetic materials has heralded a transformative shift in oncology, offering novel strategies for precise drug delivery and integration with advanced technologies such as 3D-printing. In this paper, we begin by categorizing biomimetic materials according to their origins and structural classifications, and subsequently detail their applications in the context of prostate cancer (PCa) treatment.

cancer,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a critical role in tumor progression by regulating cancer cell behavior, invasion and metastasis. This importance has motivated the development of biomaterials that closely mimic the native tumor ECM to create more accurate and predictive in vitro cancer models. In this study, oxidized cellulose nanofibrils (OCNF) are used as a simple three-dimensional scaffold for breast tumor spheroid expansion. OCNF forms a highly dynamic hydrogel in cell culture medium with rheological properties suitable for modeling early breast tumor ECM. This dynamic environment enables MCF-7 cells to form spheroids within 6 days and to continue proliferating for up to 12 days. Co-culture of MCF-7 cells with fibroblasts further models the tumor microenvironment with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Because the hydrogel is held together by non-covalent interactions, adding extra cell culture medium and pipetting converts it into a fluid-like state, facilitating spheroid release and collection for downstream applications such as drug screening and penetration studies. Overall, this work demonstrates a facile approach for preparing tumor spheroids using cellulose nanofibril hydrogels and may inspire further innovations in biomedical applications of cellulose hydrogels.",extracellular matrix ecm play critic role tumor progress regul cancer cell behavior invas metastasi import motiv develop biomateri close mimic nativ tumor ecm creat accur predict vitro cancer model studi oxid cellulos nanofibril ocnf use simpl threedimension scaffold breast tumor spheroid expans ocnf form highli dynam hydrogel cell cultur medium rheolog properti suitabl model earli breast tumor ecm dynam environ enabl mcf7 cell form spheroid within 6 day continu prolifer 12 day cocultur mcf7 cell fibroblast model tumor microenviron cancerassoci fibroblast caf hydrogel held togeth noncoval interact ad extra cell cultur medium pipet convert fluidlik state facilit spheroid releas collect downstream applic drug screen penetr studi overal work demonstr facil approach prepar tumor spheroid use cellulos nanofibril hydrogel may inspir innov biomed applic cellulos hydrogel
cancer,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), fatal outcomes predominantly result from metastatic dissemination, highlighting an urgent need for metastasis-directed therapies. Amentoflavone (AMF), a natural biflavonoid found in Ginkgo biloba and other medicinal plants, exhibits known antitumor activity. However, its role in NSCLC metastasis and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the anti-metastatic effects of AMF from Ginkgo biloba in NSCLC and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A network pharmacology approach combined with machine learning was used to predict AMF targets and derive a core diagnostic gene signature. Molecular docking and 100-ns molecular dynamics simulations were performed to characterize AMF-target binding and stability. In vitro, NSCLC cell migration was assessed using wound-healing (scratch) assays and Transwell migration chambers, with mechanistic insights obtained by Western blot analysis of EMT-related proteins. In vivo efficacy was evaluated in a murine pulmonary metastasis model established via tail-vein tumor cell injection. The machine learning model achieved an AUC of 0.951 in the internal testing set and 0.814 in the external validation set (GSE31210), indicating high robustness. RESULTS: Convergent computational analyses identified TGFBR2 as a key candidate target of AMF. Docking and 100-ns MD simulations predicted a strong and dynamically stable binding mode of AMF to TGFBR2. In vitro, AMF significantly reduced NSCLC cell migration, accompanied by downregulation of TGFBR2 and inhibition of Smad2/3 phosphorylation, which collectively reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Consistently, AMF suppressed NSCLC metastasis in vivo by inhibiting the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that AMF functions as an anti-metastatic agent in NSCLC at least in part by downregulating TGFBR2, thereby dampening TGF-beta/Smad signaling and preventing EMT. These findings highlight AMF as a promising natural candidate for developing anti-metastatic therapies that appear well tolerated under the conditions tested.",ethnopharmacolog relev nonsmal cell lung cancer nsclc fatal outcom predominantli result metastat dissemin highlight urgent need metastasisdirect therapi amentoflavon amf natur biflavonoid found ginkgo biloba medicin plant exhibit known antitumor activ howev role nsclc metastasi underli mechan remain poorli understood aim studi studi aim investig antimetastat effect amf ginkgo biloba nsclc elucid underli molecular mechan materi method network pharmacolog approach combin machin learn use predict amf target deriv core diagnost gene signatur molecular dock 100n molecular dynam simul perform character amftarget bind stabil vitro nsclc cell migrat assess use woundheal scratch assay transwel migrat chamber mechanist insight obtain western blot analysi emtrel protein vivo efficaci evalu murin pulmonari metastasi model establish via tailvein tumor cell inject machin learn model achiev auc 0951 intern test set 0814 extern valid set gse31210 indic high robust result converg comput analys identifi tgfbr2 key candid target amf dock 100n md simul predict strong dynam stabl bind mode amf tgfbr2 vitro amf significantli reduc nsclc cell migrat accompani downregul tgfbr2 inhibit smad23 phosphoryl collect revers epithelialmesenchym transit emt consist amf suppress nsclc metastasi vivo inhibit tgfbetasmad signal pathway conclus data indic amf function antimetastat agent nsclc least part downregul tgfbr2 therebi dampen tgfbetasmad signal prevent emt find highlight amf promis natur candid develop antimetastat therapi appear well toler condit test
cancer,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Bojungikki-tang (BJIKT), a traditional East-Asian multi-herbal prescription known for enhancing immune function, treating chronic fatigue, and improving general vitality, is often prescribed for conditions related to immune deficiency or cancer-related fatigue. However, its cellular mechanisms remain poorly defined. AIM OF THE STUDY: To determine whether BJIKT promotes M1-like macrophage activation and exerts antitumor effects, particularly with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and elucidate the underlying signaling mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into M0 macrophages using PMA and treated with BJIKT alone or with IFN-gamma. Expression of M1/M2 markers and pro-inflammatory cytokines was assessed using RT-qPCR and ELISA. TLR4 signaling involvement was evaluated using the selective inhibitor TAK-242. Conditioned media (CM) from treated macrophages were applied to A549 lung cancer cells, followed by MTT, LDH, and Annexin V/7-AAD assays to assess antitumor activity. Individual herbs and BJIKT phytochemicals were also tested for cytokine-inducing potential. RESULTS: BJIKT alone increased the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) but did not induce full M1 polarization-co-treatment with IFN-gamma markedly upregulated M1 genes, including CD80 and TNF-alpha. TAK-242 inhibited IFN-gamma/LPS-induced cytokine and suppressed IFN-gamma/BJIKT-induced effects, suggesting partial TLR4 dependence. CM from BJIKT/IFN-gamma-treated macrophages reduced A549 cell viability, increased cytotoxicity, and induced apoptosis. Notably, Ginseng Radix and Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma partially mimicked BJIKT, while major phytochemicals showed no comparable activity. CONCLUSIONS: BJIKT synergistically promotes M1-like macrophage activation through partial TLR4 dependence and elicits antitumor effects via macrophage-derived cytokines. These findings provide insight into how a traditional multi-herbal formula can influence macrophage activation and cytokine-mediated antitumor responses.",ethnopharmacolog relev bojungikkitang bjikt tradit eastasian multiherb prescript known enhanc immun function treat chronic fatigu improv gener vital often prescrib condit relat immun defici cancerrel fatigu howev cellular mechan remain poorli defin aim studi determin whether bjikt promot m1like macrophag activ exert antitumor effect particularli interferongamma ifngamma elucid underli signal mechan materi method thp1 monocyt differenti m0 macrophag use pma treat bjikt alon ifngamma express m1m2 marker proinflammatori cytokin assess use rtqpcr elisa tlr4 signal involv evalu use select inhibitor tak242 condit media cm treat macrophag appli a549 lung cancer cell follow mtt ldh annexin v7aad assay assess antitumor activ individu herb bjikt phytochem also test cytokineinduc potenti result bjikt alon increas secret proinflammatori cytokin il6 tnfalpha induc full m1 polarizationcotreat ifngamma markedli upregul m1 gene includ cd80 tnfalpha tak242 inhibit ifngammalpsinduc cytokin suppress ifngammabjiktinduc effect suggest partial tlr4 depend cm bjiktifngammatr macrophag reduc a549 cell viabil increas cytotox induc apoptosi notabl ginseng radix glycyrrhiza radix et rhizoma partial mimick bjikt major phytochem show compar activ conclus bjikt synergist promot m1like macrophag activ partial tlr4 depend elicit antitumor effect via macrophagederiv cytokin find provid insight tradit multiherb formula influenc macrophag activ cytokinemedi antitumor respons
cancer,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a major etiological factor in diverse gastric pathologies, accounting for approximately 75 % of gastric cancer cases. Current clinical antibiotic therapy faces significant challenges due to drug resistance, gastric acid degradation, and the formidable barriers of gastric mucus and biofilm matrix. To tackle these challenges, antibiotic-loaded nanomotors were developed for self-propelled penetration through gastric mucus and biofilm matrix to achieve H. pylori eradication. Specifically, Janus-structured J-Ca/Si@PDA-CLR nanoparticles (NPs) were fabricated by sequentially depositing mesoporous silica layers onto CaO(2) NPs and asymmetrically coating them with clarithromycin (CLR)-loaded polydopamine (PDA). CaO(2) reacted with gastric acid and produced O(2), combined with the intrinsic Janus coating, generates an asymmetrical protrusion force, enabling effective mucus penetration and preventing premature gastric emptying. The protection of mesoporous silica layers ensures long-term motion, more rapid and complete penetration across mucus layers, and deep infiltration into biofilms, enhancing drug retention in the stomach and targeted accumulation within biofilms. Following intragastrical administration in H. pylori-infected mice, the nanomotors exhibited efficient infiltration into submucosal tissues and deep distribution throughout the stomach wall, in stark contrast to their static counterparts confined to the gastric surface. Treatment with the nanomotors resulted in an 8000-fold reduction in gastric bacterial burden compared to static carriers. Remarkably, nanomotors given at half the CLR dose produced a 75-fold higher bactericidal effect compared to free CLR at twice the dose. Thus, this work establishes a feasible therapeutic strategy utilizing self-propelled NPs to overcome mucus barriers and achieve deep biofilm clearance, demonstrating significant potential for applications in treating biofilm-associated infections.",helicobact pylori h pylori infect major etiolog factor divers gastric patholog account approxim 75 gastric cancer case current clinic antibiot therapi face signific challeng due drug resist gastric acid degrad formid barrier gastric mucu biofilm matrix tackl challeng antibioticload nanomotor develop selfpropel penetr gastric mucu biofilm matrix achiev h pylori erad specif janusstructur jcasipdaclr nanoparticl np fabric sequenti deposit mesopor silica layer onto cao2 np asymmetr coat clarithromycin clrload polydopamin pda cao2 react gastric acid produc o2 combin intrins janu coat gener asymmetr protrus forc enabl effect mucu penetr prevent prematur gastric empti protect mesopor silica layer ensur longterm motion rapid complet penetr across mucu layer deep infiltr biofilm enhanc drug retent stomach target accumul within biofilm follow intragastr administr h pyloriinfect mice nanomotor exhibit effici infiltr submucos tissu deep distribut throughout stomach wall stark contrast static counterpart confin gastric surfac treatment nanomotor result 8000fold reduct gastric bacteri burden compar static carrier remark nanomotor given half clr dose produc 75fold higher bactericid effect compar free clr twice dose thu work establish feasibl therapeut strategi util selfpropel np overcom mucu barrier achiev deep biofilm clearanc demonstr signific potenti applic treat biofilmassoci infect
cancer,"Dysregulation of protein ubiquitination and deubiquitination is a key mechanism driving tumor progression. However, the role of upstream regulators and post-translational mechanisms regulating signal-induced proliferation-associated 1 (SIPA1) stability in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate novel deubiquitinases that directly bind to and stabilize SIPA1 based on its catalytic activity, along with their underlying action mechanisms. Notably, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L3 (UCHL3) was identified as the novel deubiquitinase. Mechanistically, UCHL3 removed K48-linked polyubiquitin chains from SIPA1 at lysine 805, protecting it from proteasomal degradation. In contrast, the E3 ligase itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (ITCH) promoted SIPA1 ubiquitination and degradation, acting antagonistically to UCHL3. Furthermore, UCHL3 enhanced CRC cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis through a SIPA1-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, tripartite motif-containing protein 21 regulated UCHL3 post-translationally by targeting UCHL3 for proteasomal degradation. Clinically, UCHL3 and SIPA1 were found to be upregulated in CRC tissues, whereas ITCH was downregulated, with their expression correlating with poor patient prognosis. Altogether, the findings of this study reveal the novel UCHL3-ITCH-SIPA1 regulatory axis that modulates oncogenic signaling and CRC progression, offering new insights into the post-translational regulation of SIPA1 and identifying potential therapeutic targets.",dysregul protein ubiquitin deubiquitin key mechan drive tumor progress howev role upstream regul posttransl mechan regul signalinduc proliferationassoci 1 sipa1 stabil colorect cancer crc remain unclear studi aim investig novel deubiquitinas directli bind stabil sipa1 base catalyt activ along underli action mechan notabl ubiquitin ctermin hydrolas l3 uchl3 identifi novel deubiquitinas mechanist uchl3 remov k48link polyubiquitin chain sipa1 lysin 805 protect proteasom degrad contrast e3 ligas itchi e3 ubiquitin protein ligas itch promot sipa1 ubiquitin degrad act antagonist uchl3 furthermor uchl3 enhanc crc cell prolifer invas metastasi sipa1depend mechan interestingli tripartit motifcontain protein 21 regul uchl3 posttransl target uchl3 proteasom degrad clinic uchl3 sipa1 found upregul crc tissu wherea itch downregul express correl poor patient prognosi altogeth find studi reveal novel uchl3itchsipa1 regulatori axi modul oncogen signal crc progress offer new insight posttransl regul sipa1 identifi potenti therapeut target
cancer,"The designation of Gleason score 6 (ISUP Grade Group 1) prostate cancer as ""cancer"" has become increasingly controversial. Despite its excellent prognosis and minimal risk of metastasis, the diagnosis often leads to emotional distress and potential overtreatment. The question of whether a less alarming nomenclature might be more appropriate is gaining relevance. This review analyses the arguments for and against renaming ISUP Grade Group 1 prostate cancer and explains why the definition of indolence cannot be based solely on histological criteria. Drawing on current literature and consensus statements from international pathology societies (ISUP/GUPS), this article critically evaluates pathological, clinical, molecular, and imaging criteria used to define tumour indolence. Neither morphological characteristics, nor molecular markers, nor imaging alone can reliably identify indolent cancers in biopsy specimens. Diagnostic uncertainty is further amplified by significant interobserver variability. Multidisciplinary approaches that integrate clinical, radiological, molecular, and histopathological parameters appear necessary to accurately detect and classify indolent tumours. Simply renaming GG1 prostate cancer using a less threatening term is insufficient. Instead, individualised, multidimensional risk stratification is essential. The debate underscores that the responsibility for defining indolent prostate cancer cannot rest solely with pathology.",design gleason score 6 isup grade group 1 prostat cancer cancer becom increasingli controversi despit excel prognosi minim risk metastasi diagnosi often lead emot distress potenti overtreat question whether less alarm nomenclatur might appropri gain relev review analys argument renam isup grade group 1 prostat cancer explain definit indol base sole histolog criteria draw current literatur consensu statement intern patholog societi isupgup articl critic evalu patholog clinic molecular imag criteria use defin tumour indol neither morpholog characterist molecular marker imag alon reliabl identifi indol cancer biopsi specimen diagnost uncertainti amplifi signific interobserv variabl multidisciplinari approach integr clinic radiolog molecular histopatholog paramet appear necessari accur detect classifi indol tumour simpli renam gg1 prostat cancer use less threaten term insuffici instead individualis multidimension risk stratif essenti debat underscor respons defin indol prostat cancer rest sole patholog
cancer,"Prostatitis is the most prevalent urological condition in young adult men and may progress to prostate cancer, representing a significant public health concern. A high prevalence of inflammatory prostate disorders exists without a clearly identifiable cause. This article aimed to investigate the potential association between periodontal status and prognosis in men diagnosed with prostatitis and to evaluate whether oral health influences urological treatment outcomes.A cross-sectional clinical study was conducted on 172 adult patients with prostatitis who provided written informed consent. Participants were assigned to two groups based on bleeding index (BI): Group A (GA, n = 84), BI >7%, and Group B (GB, n = 88), BI </=7%. All subjects underwent comprehensive periodontal assessment and nonsurgical periodontal therapy, with follow-up at 30 and 120 days.At baseline, GA showed significantly greater probing depths on proximal surfaces and higher BI values than GB (p < 0.01). Posttreatment, BI improved significantly in both groups, although GA maintained higher residual bleeding (p = 0.002). Mean posttreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels did not differ significantly between groups; however, PSA decreases occurred more frequently in GB (61.5%) than in GA (28.6%, p = 0.039), while PSA increases were more common in GA (57.1% vs. 15.4%, p = 0.005). Overall, 29.4% of patients exhibited lower PSA levels after periodontal therapy.While no direct association was found between periodontal status and absolute posttreatment PSA values, healthier periodontal conditions were linked to more favorable PSA trends. These findings suggest that periodontal health may contribute to PSA stability in men with prostatitis. Larger, longitudinal studies are warranted to clarify potential mechanistic links between oral and prostatic inflammation.",prostat preval urolog condit young adult men may progress prostat cancer repres signific public health concern high preval inflammatori prostat disord exist without clearli identifi caus articl aim investig potenti associ periodont statu prognosi men diagnos prostat evalu whether oral health influenc urolog treatment outcomesa crosssect clinic studi conduct 172 adult patient prostat provid written inform consent particip assign two group base bleed index bi group ga n 84 bi 7 group b gb n 88 bi 7 subject underw comprehens periodont assess nonsurg periodont therapi followup 30 120 daysat baselin ga show significantli greater probe depth proxim surfac higher bi valu gb p 001 posttreat bi improv significantli group although ga maintain higher residu bleed p 0002 mean posttreat prostatespecif antigen psa level differ significantli group howev psa decreas occur frequent gb 615 ga 286 p 0039 psa increas common ga 571 vs 154 p 0005 overal 294 patient exhibit lower psa level periodont therapywhil direct associ found periodont statu absolut posttreat psa valu healthier periodont condit link favor psa trend find suggest periodont health may contribut psa stabil men prostat larger longitudin studi warrant clarifi potenti mechanist link oral prostat inflamm
cancer,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most aggressive malignancies of head and neck cancer associated with severe morbidity and high mortality rates. While conventional treatment modalities are effective in eliminating cancer cells, they frequently result in adverse side effects. Research continues to explore plant-based therapeutics with selective cytotoxicity against cancer cells. Goniothalamus umbrosus is traditionally used among medicinal folks and has shown potential in its anticancer properties. This study aims to explore the role of G. umbrosus hexane extract (GUHE) in inducing apoptosis by elucidating its mechanism of action in OSCC (HSC-3) while comparing its effect on human gingival fibroblast (HGF) cells.The expression of proapoptotic gene (Bax) and antiapoptotic gene (Bcl-2) in HSC-3 and HGF cell lines that had been pretreated with GUHE was evaluated by RT-qPCR. The activity of caspase-3 protein was quantified by ELISA assay.RT-qPCR analysis revealed that GUHE significantly upregulated the Bax expression by 1.69-fold and downregulated Bcl-2 expression by 42% in the HSC-3 cell line. The activity of caspase-3 protein was significantly increased in HSC-3 treated with GUHE. The expression of Bax and Bcl-2 genes and caspase-3 protein activity was not significantly modulated in GUHE-treated HGF.GUHE selectively induced apoptosis by activating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in the HSC-3 cell line without being detrimental to the HGF cell line. This highlights its promising effect as a targeted therapeutic agent for OSCC therapy.",oral squamou cell carcinoma oscc one aggress malign head neck cancer associ sever morbid high mortal rate convent treatment modal effect elimin cancer cell frequent result advers side effect research continu explor plantbas therapeut select cytotox cancer cell goniothalamu umbrosu tradit use among medicin folk shown potenti anticanc properti studi aim explor role g umbrosu hexan extract guhe induc apoptosi elucid mechan action oscc hsc3 compar effect human gingiv fibroblast hgf cellsth express proapoptot gene bax antiapoptot gene bcl2 hsc3 hgf cell line pretreat guhe evalu rtqpcr activ caspase3 protein quantifi elisa assayrtqpcr analysi reveal guhe significantli upregul bax express 169fold downregul bcl2 express 42 hsc3 cell line activ caspase3 protein significantli increas hsc3 treat guhe express bax bcl2 gene caspase3 protein activ significantli modul guhetr hgfguhe select induc apoptosi activ mitochondri apoptosi pathway hsc3 cell line without detriment hgf cell line highlight promis effect target therapeut agent oscc therapi
cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Liver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Traditional imaging techniques including CT and MRI provide valuable anatomical data but often overlook the liver's functional heterogeneity, which is crucial for accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment. AREAS COVERED: This review explores advancements in functional imaging modalities, including contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), and PET/CT, which provide detailed insights into tumor biology and treatment response in HCC. CEUS enables real-time assessment of hepatic microvascular perfusion with excellent temporal resolution and without ionizing radiation. DCE-MRI and perfusion CT permit time-resolved quantification of perfusion kinetics and vascular permeability, offering surrogate biomarkers of tumor angiogenesis and treatment response. PET/CT, through tracers captures regional variations in metabolism, reflecting tumor viability and functional reserve. EXPERT OPINION: Collectively, these modalities advance precision imaging by linking physiological and metabolic information to morphologic findings, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy, risk stratification, and therapy monitoring in hepatocellular carcinoma.",introduct liver cancer particularli hepatocellular carcinoma hcc lead caus cancerrel mortal worldwid tradit imag techniqu includ ct mri provid valuabl anatom data often overlook liver function heterogen crucial accur diagnosi person treatment area cover review explor advanc function imag modal includ contrastenhanc ultrasound ceu diffusionweight imag dwi dynam contrastenhanc mri dcemri petct provid detail insight tumor biolog treatment respons hcc ceu enabl realtim assess hepat microvascular perfus excel tempor resolut without ioniz radiat dcemri perfus ct permit timeresolv quantif perfus kinet vascular permeabl offer surrog biomark tumor angiogenesi treatment respons petct tracer captur region variat metabol reflect tumor viabil function reserv expert opinion collect modal advanc precis imag link physiolog metabol inform morpholog find therebi improv diagnost accuraci risk stratif therapi monitor hepatocellular carcinoma
cancer,"Base mutations (mismatches, insertions, or deletions) in microRNAs (miRNAs) are frequently associated with diseases including as cancer, where they significantly alter miRNA structure and function. However, the accurately detection of low-abundance mutants amid highly similar sequences remains a major challenge. In this study, we developed a sensing strategy based on the ionic current and hybridization free energy, which employs glass micropipette channels functionalized with polydopamine nanotubes (PDA-NTs) and peptide nucleic acids (PNA), which enables enzyme-free, high-resolution identification of low-abundance miRNA-21 base mutations. The detection mechanism relies on mutation-induced conformational changes during PNA-miRNA hybridization, which modulate nanopore ion permeability and produce distinct current signatures. By correlating these signals with hybridization Gibbs free energy (DeltaG), we established a link between thermodynamic stability and current response. When DeltaDeltaG > 1 kcal/mol, a segmented linear relationship was observed between DeltaDeltaG and the normalized current decrease Delta[(I(0)-I(C))/I(0)], allowing precise discrimination of mutant types, numbers, and locations based on ionic current response. In contrast, when DeltaDeltaG < 1 kcal/mol, the signal change Delta[(I(0)-I(C))/I(0)] remained below 5%, making it challenging to differentiate mutants from the wild-type. This portable highly sensitive miRNA mutation sensing strategy offers strong potential for rapid molecular diagnostics and clinical decision-making.",base mutat mismatch insert delet microrna mirna frequent associ diseas includ cancer significantli alter mirna structur function howev accur detect lowabund mutant amid highli similar sequenc remain major challeng studi develop sens strategi base ionic current hybrid free energi employ glass micropipett channel function polydopamin nanotub pdant peptid nucleic acid pna enabl enzymefre highresolut identif lowabund mirna21 base mutat detect mechan reli mutationinduc conform chang pnamirna hybrid modul nanopor ion permeabl produc distinct current signatur correl signal hybrid gibb free energi deltag establish link thermodynam stabil current respons deltadeltag 1 kcalmol segment linear relationship observ deltadeltag normal current decreas deltai0ici0 allow precis discrimin mutant type number locat base ionic current respons contrast deltadeltag 1 kcalmol signal chang deltai0ici0 remain 5 make challeng differenti mutant wildtyp portabl highli sensit mirna mutat sens strategi offer strong potenti rapid molecular diagnost clinic decisionmak
