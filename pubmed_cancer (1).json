    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Placental tissue contains a variety of tumor-associated antigens. Antigen-specific T cells generated by expanded dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with placental peptides have the potential to exert antitumor effects both in vitro and in vivo. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the immunotherapeutic potential of placental peptides as a novel source of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). We hypothesized that DCs, expanded and matured in vitro and pulsed with placental peptide extracts, can effectively prime antigen-specific T cells (ASTs) with robust cytotoxic activity against various tumor cell lines and in vivo tumor models. METHODS: Mass spectrometry was used to identify tumor-related peptides within the placental extract. In vitro assays were employed to assess the expansion of DCs, their maturation following exposure to placental peptide preparations, and the subsequent activation of T cells. RESULTS: The cytotoxic activity of ASTs was assessed and showed strong tumor cell killing across three cancer cell lines, U87MG (glioblastoma), SH-SY5Y (neuroblastoma), and MCF-7 (breast cancer). In a neuroblastoma animal model, ASTs treatment significantly reduced tumor proliferation, indicating substantial therapeutic potential in vivo. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that DCs pulsed with placental peptides can generate ASTs with potent antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Additional studies are needed to determine applicability across other tumor types, refine therapeutic parameters, and assess clinical potential."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a pulmonary disorder that occurs in patients allergic to Aspergillus species. It is typically characterized by reversible airway obstruction, transient pulmonary infiltrates, eosinophilia, and fever. Chest radiographs and high-resolution computed tomography (CT) are essential for diagnosis and differential diagnosis. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a tumor-specific marker, is often elevated in various malignant tumors but can also be increased in nonmalignant conditions. This overlap can result in misdiagnosis and unnecessary anxiety, leading to inappropriate clinical management. We report a case of ABPA presenting with pulmonary shadows that mimicked lung cancer, as well as elevated serum CEA levels. This report aims to enhance clinicians' understanding of ABPA, improve diagnostic accuracy, and reduce the likelihood of misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis. CASE REPORT A 39-year-old woman with a history of bronchial asthma presented with a productive cough. Chest CT revealed solid lesions in the left upper pulmonary lobe with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Her serum CEA level was elevated, raising suspicion of malignancy. A positron emission tomography-CT scan demonstrated increased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the lungs. However, a CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy, combined with other relevant diagnostic tests, confirmed ABPA according to the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) criteria. After corticosteroid therapy, both the radiographic findings and serum CEA levels improved. CONCLUSIONS To avoid unnecessary invasive procedures and misdiagnosis of malignancy, ABPA should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with asthma who present with pulmonary solid lesions and elevated serum CEA levels."

In silico profiling predicted favorable pharmacokinetic and drug-like properties for cFP. The compound demonstrated dose-dependent cytotoxicity against human breast (MDA MB-231), pancreatic (PAN C1), and prostate (PC 3) cancer cell lines with IC(5)(0) values of 47.24 +/- 0.42, 40.96 +/- 0.68, and 110 +/- 1.48 microM, respectively, accompanied by apoptosis-associated morphological changes. Biophysical studies demonstrated strong binding affinity between cFP and human serum albumin (HSA), confirmed through UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence quenching, and circular dichroism analyses, with validation using well-characterized reference ligand warfarin as control. Results suggest static quenching via ground-state complex formation with negligible lifetime changes, consistent with control molecule (warfarin) binding via hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions, accompanied by ligand-induced decreases in HSA alpha-helical content. Molecular docking studies of HSA with cFP and warfarin revealed strong binding affinities for both compounds. Further, the molecular dynamics simulations over a 50 ns timeframe confirmed the enhanced stability and persistent interaction of the cFP-HSA complex. Results highlight the cFP as a promising bioactive peptide with potential anticancer, pharmacokinetic and serum binding efficacies advocating further preclinical development for anticancer therapy."

Here, we develop the DuoKinaseNet, a dual-task spectral graph neural network that integrates global topological information from a heterogeneous biomedical graph to enable structure-preserving prediction of drug-kinase interactions. The core innovation of our model is the Structure-Preserving Spectral Expansion (SPSE) module, which injects global graph topology from a biomedical knowledge graph into the learning process via spectral coordinates and diffusion-distance biased attention. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset curated from DrugBank, DuoKinaseNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on the challenging \"unseen protein\" benchmark, with an AUC-ROC of 0.903 for HER2 and 0.895 for FGFR2b. It significantly outperforms a wide range of baseline models, including 3D-aware methods and single-task variants, empirically validating the synergistic benefits of the dual-task learning and SPSE frameworks."

    "abstract": "In 2022, Hanahan integrated polymorphic microbiomes to the hallmarks of cancer, resulting in 14 overarching features that are considered fundamental to initiation and progression of cancers. It is well acknowledged that genomic instability/genetic alterations together with tumor-associated inflammation are so called \"enabling hallmarks\" as they drive the acquisition of the other traits. The microbiome is a key component of the inflammatory tumor stroma. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in particular is characterized by a pronounced stromal compartment whose role in the acquisition of malignant properties is well documented. Recent studies indicate massive alterations of the microbiome in PDAC tissues compared to healthy pancreas or precursor lesions. However, the mechanistic role of the PDAC-associated microbiome, its influence on the hallmarks of cancer, and how this relates to PDAC malignancy remain poorly understood. This raises the question of whether the tumor-associated microbiome through its direct influence on PDAC cells, their precursors, and the surrounding non-neoplastic cells promotes the acquisition of other hallmarks that drive PDAC development and progression. This perspective article outlines the current knowledge of the impact of the PDAC-associated microbiome on the hallmarks of cancer in PDAC. These current findings support the altered microbiome as a third enabling hallmark of PDAC and emphasize that further mechanistic studies are urgently needed to further substantiate its fundamental importance for this tumor entity. This knowledge will provide the basis for clinical translation to develop more effective therapeutic approaches for PDAC. The intratumoral microbiome in PDAC exhibits numerous interactions with the hallmarks of cancer. Hallmarks indicated in blue have demonstrated interactions with the microbiome, while others still remain underexplored. These extensive interactions substantiate the role of the intratumoral microbiome in PDAC as an enabling hallmark, underlining its potential as a therapeutic target.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence is rising among adults under 55 years, but its causes remain unclear. Large-scale prospective studies are needed to identify risk factors for early-onset CRC (EOCRC). METHODS: We pooled three large European prospective cohort studies, examining 14 known or suspected risk factors with EOCRC (diagnosed <55 years, N = 1369) and later-onset CRCs (LOCRC) (diagnosed >/=55 years, N = 13,490). Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Higher body mass index (BMI, per 5 kg/m(2) increase), was strongly associated with EOCRC in men (HR 1.33, 95% CI: 1.18-1.51), particularly for early-onset colon cancer (HR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.32-1.82), compared to later-onset disease (HR 1.25, 95% CI: 1.19-1.31) (Phet = 0.01). Weaker associations with BMI were observed for women and rectal cancers. Similar sex and subsite specific trends were observed for waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio. Current smoking (HR 1.24, 95% CI: 1.07-1.44) and alcohol use (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06-1.25) increased EOCRC risk, and physical activity (HR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.54-0.95) was protective. DISCUSSION: Adiposity, physical inactivity, smoking, and alcohol consumption are risk factors for EOCRC. Risk factors were largely similar between EOCRC and LOCRC, except for adiposity, with stronger EOCRC association in men."

    "abstract": "Lactylation, a recently identified histone modification derived from lactate metabolism, has emerged as a critical regulator of epigenetic reprogramming, tumor proliferation, and immune evasion. In ovarian cancer, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and other metabolic enzymes contribute to lactate accumulation, which supports chemotherapy resistance and disease progression. Although lactylation is increasingly linked to therapy failure, its precise molecular connection with ovarian cancer, as well as its therapeutic potential are unclear. Traditional analytical approaches often fail to integrate the complexity of multi-omics, limiting the discovery of actionable lactylation-associated vulnerabilities. This research aims to develop an AI-driven multi-omics framework to identify lactylation-related genes, stratify patient drug responses, and establish prognostic signatures in ovarian cancer. Transcriptomic, epigenomic, pharmacogenomic, mutation, and clinical outcome data were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC), and independent ovarian cancer cohorts. Deep learning models, including variational autoencoders (VAEs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Multitask Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) (LSTM-MLP), were applied for molecular subtyping, survival analysis, and IC50 prediction. Findings were validated through pathway enrichment, mutation mapping, immune infiltration profiling, and structure-guided drug repurposing, the proposed method achieved precision of (0.955). Key lactylation-related genes, including LDHA and SLC16A3, were associated with immune exhaustion and cisplatin resistance. The Gln-TEx score and lactylation risk signature robustly predicted patient survival and drug response across TCGA and validation cohorts. Perturbation sensitivity and repurposing analyses revealed novel therapeutic vulnerabilities. This study establishes a precision oncology framework that integrates lactylation biology with AI-driven analytics to uncover druggable targets, enhance patient stratification, and inform the design of multi-target therapies in ovarian cancer."

    "abstract": "Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is an antibody-drug conjugate successfully used to treat HER2-low and HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, but resistance consistently develops. Using multivariate Cox proportional hazards in a real-world cohort of 2,799 patients with breast cancer, we aimed to identify clinically relevant T-DXd resistance mechanisms. In patients with samples collected prior to T-DXd treatment, higher expression of ERBB2 (HER2) and lower expression of ABCC1 (an ATP-binding cassette transporter involved in drug efflux) were significantly associated with longer T-DXd-related overall survival (OS); ABCC1 predicted OS independently of HER2. Furthermore, mutations in several genes were enriched in post-T-DXd samples compared to unmatched T-DXd-naive samples, including ERBB2, NFE2L2 (a transcriptional activator of ABCC1), and KEAP1 (a negative regulator of NFE2L2), indicating plausible resistance mechanisms related to HER2 target levels and ABCC1-mediated drug efflux. Identifying such resistance mechanisms might lead to improved methods of precision oncology and novel therapeutic approaches to overcome resistance."

METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, we will enroll 100 patients aged over 65 years, schemed for laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery under general anesthesia. They will be randomly assigned to two groups: the conventional group will adopt the traditional insulation intervention, and the intervention group will implement the composite insulation care intervention. Changes in heart rate and blood pressure between immediately 15 and 30 min after surgery and the incidence of anesthesia recovery and complications between the two groups will be recorded and analyzed. DISCUSSION: It is expected that the perioperative composite insulation intervention strategy can effectively maintain the patient's body temperature, reduce the postoperative stress response, and reduce the incidence of hypothermia and related complications. It can improve the surgical safety and the quality of postoperative recovery in elderly patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (https://www.chictr.org.cn/) ChiCTR2400088729.

Their circular topology, which disrupts topological domains and rewires regulatory circuits, has typically been studied via pairwise interactions. Here we develop ec3D, a computational method for reconstructing three-dimensional ecDNA structures from Hi-C data. Given a candidate ecDNA sequence and whole-genome Hi-C data, ec3D reconstructs spatial structures by maximizing the Poisson likelihood of observed interactions. We validate ec3D using simulated structures, previously characterized cancer cell lines, and microscopy imaging. Our reconstructions reveal that ecDNAs occupy spherical configurations and mediate unique long-range regulatory interactions involved in gene regulation. Through algorithmic innovations, ec3D can resolve complex structures with duplicated segments, identify multi-way interactions, and identify potential intermolecular (trans) interactions. Our findings provide insights into how ecDNA's spatial organization bypasses normal chromosomal constraints and contributes to increased oncogene expression."

    "abstract": "The human gut microbiota serves as a critical hub for host metabolic and immune regulation. Disruption of its homeostasis is closely associated with diseases such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), metabolic syndrome, and colorectal cancer. Modern dietary and environmental factors are known to exacerbate this dysbiosis, highlighting the need for innovative interventions capable of modulating the gut ecosystem. Within this context, this review explores the potential of edible fungi, focusing on culinary mushrooms (e.g., Lentinula edodes) and medicinal fungi such as Ganoderma lucidum and Phellinus linteus, which are widely studied in Asia for their health benefits. While consumed as functional foods for their nutritional properties in some countries, they are used in traditional medicine in others. This review examines the role of their bioactive components (e.g., polysaccharides, terpenoids) in remodeling the gut microbiome, thereby highlighting their application in functional foods and dietary interventions. This review systematically examines the pathological mechanisms underlying gut dysbiosis and elucidates how bioactive fungal components (e.g., beta-glucans, ganoderic acids) improve intestinal barrier function and immune homeostasis by modulating the composition of the gut microbiota, enhancing the production of SCFAs (short-chain fatty acids), and inhibiting the colonization of pathogens. Current evidence, primarily from preclinical studies, suggests that bioactive fungal components, such as beta-glucans from Ganoderma lucidum and polysaccharides from Trametes versicolor, may impart health benefits against metabolic disorders and neoplasms. These benefits are mediated through the modulation of microbiota-derived metabolites (e.g., SCFAs) and epigenetic remodeling mechanisms (e.g., HDAC (Histone Deacetylase) inhibition), suggesting their potential application in functional foods and nutritional strategies. metabolites (e.g., SCFAs) and epigenetic remodeling mechanisms (e.g., HDAC inhibition). However, critical gaps persist, particularly in translating these preclinical findings to humans. Key challenges include understanding their bioavailability, establishing human-relevant dose-response relationships, and elucidating spatiotemporal dynamics within microbiota-host interaction networks. Addressing these gaps requires integration with multi-omics technologies and well-designed clinical trials. Multi-omics and organoid models should be integrated by future research to advance precision medicine applications of fungal-derived therapies."

    "abstract": "HER2, encoded by the ERBB2 gene, is a receptor tyrosine kinase frequently activated in human cancers via gene amplification, mutation, and/or protein overexpression. In an analysis of 42,415 prospectively analyzed solid tumors, we show that 14.5% of urothelial cancers (n = 295/2,035) have oncogenic or likely oncogenic ERBB2 alterations (6.7% ERBB2 mutation, 6.3% amplification of wildtype ERBB2, and 1.5% concurrent mutation and amplification). Discordance of ERBB2 mutational status between primary and metastatic disease sites is common in patients with urothelial cancer as is discordance of ERBB2 mutational status between patient-derived organoid/xenograft models and the tumors from which they were derived. In patient-derived urothelial cancer models, the HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) trastuzumab deruxtecan is significantly more effective than the HER kinase inhibitor neratinib. In a real-world cohort of patients with urothelial cancer treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan, co-mutation and amplification of ERBB2 is associated with exceptional clinical response. Our data support expanded clinical trials of HER2-targeted ADCs for urothelial cancers with low HER2 expression, the clinical testing of HER2 ADCs with alternative cytotoxic payloads, and the development of functional precision oncology platforms capable of assessing payload sensitivity pre-treatment as a guide to individualized therapy selection."

This retrospective, single-center study enrolled patients with stage II/III colon cancer who underwent curative surgery between December 2016 and September 2020. The ecological spatial characteristics of tumor habitats at the Class-level and Landscape-level were extracted by landscape pattern analysis. Univariate and multivariate COX regression analysis were used to determine the spatial characteristics related to metachronous metastasis and included in the prediction model, and the landscape score value was constructed to stratified the risk of metachronous metastasis. The predictive performance was evaluated using the time-dependent area under the ROC curve (AUC). Metachronous metastases occurred in 31 of 93 patients (median age, 61 years, [IQR, 51-65 years]).

While its enzymatic activity is important in mediating innate immunity, here we highlight that hGIIA contributes to PCa pathology primarily through specific protein-protein interactions. We have developed cyclic peptides cF and c2, derived from the structure of hGIIA, that selectively inhibit these interactions and inhibit PCa growth. hGIIA interacts directly with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), resulting in increased cytosolic PLA(2)-alpha activation and prostaglandin E(2) production, which is suppressed by c2. Further, vimentin was identified to bind hGIIA in PCa cells, modulating hGIIA intracellular trafficking. c2 binds vimentin, blocking this interaction and initiating vimentin-mediated aggresome formation and apoptosis even in the absence of hGIIA. cF and c2 suppress androgen-sensitive, castrate-resistant and androgen-independent models of tumour growth in vivo at doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg, are non-toxic, orally bioavailable and cell-permeable. Critically, as with hGIIA, EGFR and vimentin are also increasingly expressed as PCa develops, cF and c2 may represent a novel therapeutic option for incurable metastatic castrate resistant PCa. Our findings identify hGIIA as an innate immune effector that regulates both inflammation and PCa progression and describe a novel class of hGIIA protein-protein interaction inhibitor with therapeutic potential in PCa."

However, the rational design of a multifunctional nanoplatform that integrates active targeting, multimodal imaging, and synergistic therapy through a green and sustainable approach remains highly challenging. Herein, we report a facile and environmentally benign solvothermal strategy for the synthesis of ruthenium-doped CQD nanozymes (Ru-CQDs) functionalized with AS1411 aptamers and polyethylene glycol (PEG), denoted as Ru-CQDs-AS1411@PEG. This eco-friendly synthesis avoids toxic reagents and harsh conditions while yielding highly uniform and biocompatible nanozymes. The obtained Ru-CQDs-AS1411@PEG exhibit strong NIR-II absorption, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and pronounced peroxidase-mimicking catalytic activity. The AS1411 aptamer confers active tumor-targeting capability, while PEGylation enhances aqueous dispersibility and physiological stability. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that Ru-CQDs-AS1411@PEG enable precise photoacoustic tumor imaging and potent tumor ablation under NIR-II laser irradiation via synergistic photothermal and catalytic reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.

It has been hypothesized that nitrosyl-heme, formed by the addition of nitrites during meat processing, may enhance the carcinogenic effects of PMs. This study aims to investigate the association between nitrosyl-heme intake and CRC risk within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition(EPIC) study. METHODS: This prospective study included 367,463 participants(70.3% women) from seven countries from the EPIC-study. Dietary data were collected via baseline questionnaires, and nitrosyl-heme exposure was estimated using biochemical data from 52 Spanish PMs, extrapolated to country-specific items. Sex-specific multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios(HRs) and 95% confidence intervals(CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Over a 15-year median follow-up, 5,115 incident CRC cases were identified. Comparing the highest vs. the lowest sex-specific tertile of nitrosyl-heme intake we found no significant association with CRC risk (HR(T3vsT1):1.01;95%CI:0.93-1.09). Subgroup analyses by tumor subtype and interactions with lifestyle factors also showed no associations.

Targeting the gut-liver axis offers new therapeutic opportunities to prevent this progression. In this study, colon-targeted chitosan/pectin-based nanoparticles loaded with Astragalus polysaccharide (APs-CS/PT-NPs) were developed to modulate gut microbiota and inhibit liver tumorigenesis. The nanoparticles exhibited robust physicochemical stability and pH-responsive release. In vivo, oral administration of APs-CS/PT-NPs attenuated hepatic steatosis, reduced inflammatory cytokines, and suppressed NAFLD-induced HCC development. 16 S rRNA sequencing revealed restoration of microbial diversity and enhanced production of short-chain fatty acids, especially acetate. Mechanistically, transcriptomic profiling and functional analysis identified acetate as a key mediator, acting via G-protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) to inhibit the NF-kappaB pathway.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains highly aggressive, with limited benefits from anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. We investigated the synergistic effects of a novel two-domain soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (2d-sFlt-1), in enhancing paclitaxel efficacy compared with bevacizumab using 3D breast cancer models. METHODS: 3D spheroids derived from triple-negative (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) and luminal (MCF-7) breast cancer cell lines, as well as tumor-endothelial co-culture spheroids, were treated with paclitaxel alone or in combination with 2d-sFlt-1 or bevacizumab. Treatment efficacy was evaluated through drug-sensitivity, proliferation, viability, migration, and morphometric analyses, along with assessments of angiogenesis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling. Statistical significance was determined using non-parametric tests or one- and two-way ANOVA with appropriate multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Transition from 2D monolayer to 3D spheroid culture markedly increased paclitaxel resistance, with IC(5)(0) values elevated by roughly 25-fold. Co-treatment with 2d-sFlt-1 markedly enhanced paclitaxel efficacy, reducing the IC(5)(0) values by approximately tenfold in MDA-MB-231 spheroids and sixfold in MDA-MB-468 spheroids, whereas bevacizumab produced only modest effects. Paclitaxel and 2d-sFlt-1 combination further suppressed spheroid growth and proliferation in both TNBC and luminal breast cancer models. In MDA-MB-231 spheroids, combination therapy reversed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by increasing E-cadherin while downregulating N-cadherin, SNAIL, and TWIST, and further reduced VEGF secretion and angiogenic tube formation. In tumor-endothelial co-cultures, FAK signaling was markedly reduced after combination treatment. Across all models and assays, paclitaxel and 2d-sFlt-1 combination consistently outperformed monotherapy and paclitaxel plus bevacizumab, underscoring its potential as a mechanistically synergistic strategy for overcoming chemoresistance in triple-negative breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: 2d-sFlt-1 enhanced paclitaxel efficacy in physiologically relevant 3D breast cancer models. In MDA-MB-231 spheroids, the combination reduced chemoresistance and invasive growth through coordinated modulation of angiogenesis, EMT, and FAK signaling. In MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 spheroids, it primarily increased cytotoxicity and growth inhibition, indicating a conserved functional benefit across subtypes. These findings provide a rationale for further mechanistic validation and preclinical evaluation of 2d-sFlt-1 plus paclitaxel to define dosing, safety, and translational feasibility in aggressive breast cancers."

Optically guided VABB using Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) may help address this limitation. METHODS: To this end, an optical introducer (a cut-out 9-gauge hollow tube) was developed and equipped with optical fibers. The tube slides over a standard VABB needle, enabling tis- sue measurements near the biopsy aperture. Ex vivo DRS measurements were performed on lumpectomy specimens from 90 patients using this tube, yielding over 500 measurement loca- tions. Tissue labels were derived through deformable image registration of measurement sites with annotated histology, and label extraction was optimized for larger fiber distances. Machine learning classifiers were trained on the spectral data. RESULTS: Ensemble models achieved up to 94% sensitivity at a 20% tumor threshold and maintained high performance at lower thresholds. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that DRS enables real-time tissue characterization at large fiber distances and may improve biopsy precision. In vivo studies are needed to validate performance and support the integration of DRS into routine VABB diagnostic workflows."

The pCAFs being of mesenchymal stem/stromal cell origin, interact directly with tumor stromal elements, modulate tumor development, and are involved in the formation of pre-metastatic niches that result in unsatisfactory PDAC treatment outcomes. This study aimed to develop an innovative approach for the treatment of desmoplastic pancreatic carcinoma via intracellularly targeted exosomes derived from pCAFs and from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transduced with the suicide gene - yeast cytosine deaminase::uracil phosphoribosyl transferase (yCD::UPRT). METHODS: pCAFs were isolated from four PDAC tumor specimens and MSCs from various tissues. Their transduction with yCD::UPRT gene produce homogenous gene transduced cell populations capable of secreting suicide gene exosomes. Both gene- transduced and naive cells and their exosomes underwent characterization by biophysical, biochemical, microscopic, and LC-MS/MS proteomic methods. Tumor cell-killing functionality was assessed using three pancreatic cancer cell lines. The killing efficacy of combined suicide gene exosomes of MSCs and pCAFs was measured in a mixture of pCAFs and MIA PaCa-2 cells as a simulated desmoplastic pancreatic tumor in vitro. RESULTS: MSCs and pCAFs suicide gene exosomes act as cancer cell-targeted drugs, effectively killing pancreatic carcinoma cells. Exosomes intracellular convert the non-toxic prodrug 5-fluorocytosine into cytotoxic 5-fluorouracil and its metabolites in a dose-dependent manner. In experiments simulating the desmoplastic microenvironment of PDAC, we have found that the suicide gene exosomes from both cells conjugated with prodrug effectively target and inhibit the growth of simulated PDAC. CONCLUSION: Exosomes containing the yCD::UPRT gene from pCAFs and MSCs function as \"Trojan horse\" therapies, efficiently and dose-dependently eliminating pancreatic cancer cells. PDAC environment-targeted yCD::UPRT-gene exosomes from MSCs and pCAFs show promise for a novel PDAC treatment."

    "abstract": "KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), due to its evolution of more complex antioxidant metabolic mechanisms, exhibits poorer sensitivity to conventional platinum-based drugs compared to other types of LUAD. Ferroptosis, as a means of inducing cell death in cancer therapy, shows unique features and potential therapeutic effects compared to the conventional form of apoptosis, which is frequently obstructed by drug resistance. In human KRAS-mutant LUAD cell lines and mouse models, we found that the deubiquitinase OTU deubiquitinase 7A (OTUD7A) precisely regulates the lysine demethylase 5B (KDM5B). Inhibition of KDM5B expression increases the H4K20me3 level, which in turn downregulates the expression of transcription factor GABPA associated with mitochondrial function, ultimately promoting the production of more Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) by mitochondria and inducing ferroptosis. Additionally, in in vivo organoid models, cisplatin (CDDP) induced ferroptosis combined with GABPA inhibition demonstrated superior anticancer effects compared to conventional platinum-based drugs. This research identifies new targets and regulatory networks that hold promise for developing ferroptosis-based therapies for KRAS-mutant LUAD."

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and nanotechnology is reshaping cancer diagnosis and treatment. In this context, intelligent nanoplatforms are multifunctional nanoscale systems designed or optimized with the help of AI, capable of combining tumor sensing, targeted delivery, controlled release, and adaptive response within a single platform. AI can analyze large-scale multi-omics and clinical datasets to support early cancer detection, accurate diagnosis, prognosis assessment, and refinement of personalized treatment strategies, while nanotechnology enables precise tumor targeting and site-specific drug delivery through diverse nanocarriers, thereby reducing systemic toxicity and improving therapeutic efficacy. Their interaction allows more rational nanomedicine design by optimizing key properties such as targeting capability, stability, and responsiveness, and nano-enabled imaging and sensing provide high-resolution data that further enhance model performance. Together, these advances point toward more personalized and efficient strategies for cancer diagnosis, therapy, and monitoring, although challenges related to data sharing, standardization, privacy, ethics, regulation, and development costs still need to be addressed for broader and safer clinical implementation."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patient-reported symptomatic adverse events (AE) are increasingly collected in oncology clinical trials to characterize treatment tolerability and inform clinical decision making using the Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE(R)). Although there are numerous analysis methods and graphical approaches used for PRO-CTCAE data, the current PRO literature is limited in unified reporting and graphical approaches as well as public-facing analysis tools. RESULTS: Collaborative efforts from the Standardization Working Group of the National Cancer Institute Cancer Treatment Tolerability Consortium worked to develop the R package, ProAE. Testing and validation of widely used methods were implemented in the R package and deployed to various open-source outlets including the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). CONCLUSION: ProAE is a free and publicly available collection of standardized statistical analysis tools for PRO-CTCAE and other PRO data used in patient care and research. The ProAE package provides oncology researchers with an efficient and modern means to apply the published analysis approaches, including hypothesis testing, descriptive and inferential tables, and longitudinal graphics, without the need for costly software or licensing."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and submucosal tunneling endoscopic resection (STER) have become the safe and effective techniques for early-stage esophageal cancer and small-diameter submucosal tumors of the esophagus. Yet, there remains insufficient research on the appropriate fasting period following ESD or STER in patients with early esophageal neoplasms. This study aims to assess the impact of different fasting durations-long versus short-on postoperative complication rates and hospital stay durations. METHODS: Patients with esophageal tumors less than 2 cm in diameter who underwent ESD or STER between 2014 and 2020 in the Department of Gastroenterology at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University were analyzed. RESULTS: In intention to treat (ITT) analysis, 266 patients were part of the long fasting group, and 93 patients were part of the short fasting group. After matching, propensity score matching analysis (PSMA) resulted in 88 matched pairs between short and long fasting group, covariates were well balanced across both groups. Stratified analysis of esophageal ESD or STER indicate that the incidence of Postoperative discomfort and complications did not differ significantly between the two groups(all P > 0.05). And the length of hospital stay remained significantly longer in the long fasting group compared to the short fasting group with esophageal ESD (7.63 +/- 2.56 days vs. 6.52 +/- 2.17 days, P = 0.01) or esophageal STER (7.86 +/- 2.07 days vs. 6.67 +/- 1.90 days, P = 0.037). Supplementary per protocol (PP) analysis also showed similar trends in the incidence of Postoperative adverse events or complications and the hospitalization duration. CONCLUSIONS: For small esophageal tumors (< 2 cm), short fasting after ESD or STER shows similar complication rates to long fasting but significantly shortens hospitalization, Improving its efficiency in postoperative care."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) is essential for carcinogenesis and the advancement of cancer, making it a promising therapeutic target in oncology. Nevertheless, comprehensive bioinformatic analyses of TRAP1 across diverse cancer types are limited. Herein, we analyzed TRAP1 across all cancer types, focusing on its expression in relation to prognosis, immune infiltration, and the mammalian target of rapamycin and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. METHODS: We evaluated TRAP1's clinical relevance for prognostic predictions and its association with tumor immunity and metabolism. TRAP1's function in hepatocellular carcinoma cell invasion, migration, and proliferation was examined in vitro using wound healing assays and the cell counting kit-8; apoptosis was examined through reactive oxygen species detection. RESULTS: We found that TRAP1 significantly predicts cancer prognosis and is closely linked to immune and metabolic tumor characteristics. In liver cancer cells, TRAP1 knockdown prevented invasion, migration, and proliferation; increased reactive oxygen species; and promoted apoptosis. CONCLUSION: In summary, this study reveals the critical clinical significance of TRAP1 across multiple cancer types through a pan-cancer analysis. Further in vitro experiments demonstrate that knocking down TRAP1 significantly suppresses malignant phenotypes of tumor cells in hepatocellular carcinoma by inducing oxidative stress and apoptosis. Thus, TRAP1, particularly in liver cancer, represents a highly promising prognostic biomarker and a novel metabolic therapeutic target. These findings provide direction for subsequent research on TRAP1 and strongly support its potential for translational exploration in hepatocellular carcinoma treatment."

In this study, we examined the application of PurIST, a molecular subtyping algorithm for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), across different platforms. We compared PurIST calls between matched samples processed by whole transcriptome and commercial exome capture RNA-seq. In parallel, we compared subtypes between matched samples processed by NanoString and whole transcriptome RNA-seq from the PANCREAS trial (NCT04683315). Between whole transcriptome and exome capture, subtype agreement was 81% with significant increase in basal-like subtype with exome capture. Differences in overall survival in patients with basal-like tumors compared to classical tumors did not reach statistical significance using exome capture (log-rank P = 0.061), whereas with whole transcriptome it was significantly shorter (log-rank P < 0.0001). Subtype agreement between whole transcriptome RNA-seq and NanoString was higher at 95%. PurIST results should be interpreted with caution when using exome capture methods."

We developed GTRNet, an interpretable end-to-end deep-learning framework that classifies T1-T4 from routine CT without manual segmentation or annotation. In a retrospective multicenter study of 1792 patients, CT images underwent standardized preprocessing and the largest axial tumor slice was used for training; performance was then tested in two independent external cohorts. GTRNet achieved high discrimination (AUC 0.86-0.95) and accuracy (81-85%) in internal and external tests, surpassing radiologists. Grad-CAM heatmaps localized attention to the gastric wall and serosa. Combining a deep-learning rad-score with tumor size, differentiation and Lauren subtype, we constructed a nomogram with good calibration and higher net clinical benefit than conventional approaches. This automated and interpretable pipeline may standardize CT-based staging and support preoperative decision-making and neoadjuvant-therapy selection."

While high-risk HPV infection has been studied as a possible driver, other factors, including occupational exposures, may play a role. Thirty-two cases (n = 32) of ISP and ISP SCC were retrospectively analysed. These cases had been diagnosed between 2010 and 2022. We assessed their occupational history through the Italian Sino-Nasal Cancer Registry questionnaire and performed p16/p53 immunohistochemistry, HPV DNA and RNA testing. Overall, 41% of ISP and 40% of ISP-SCC cases reported exposure to IARC Group 1-2 A carcinogens, and 69% had a history of smoking. Transcriptionally active HPV was detected in only one case (3.1%). Conventional bivariate analyses did not reveal significant associations between occupational exposure and malignant transformation. However, hierarchical cluster analysis identified three distinct phenotypes. Cluster 1 included predominantly male smokers with high cumulative occupational and non-occupational exposure, with ISP-SCC in 17%. Cluster 2, characterized by the highest occupational exposure and lowest smoking prevalence, consisted exclusively of ISP-SCC cases (100%), suggesting occupational carcinogens as a possible independent driver. Cluster 3 had minimal exposure, inflammatory features, and no malignant transformation. These findings highlight the potential of multidimensional analytical approaches to identify high-risk subgroups and inform targeted preventive and surveillance strategies in exposed populations."

GRP78 (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein), a key endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident chaperone involved in protein folding and stress response, has been observed atypically localized on the cell surface of various cancer and stressed cell types, where it engages in non-canonical signaling and cellular functions. Cell surface GRP78 (csGRP78) is preferentially expressed in malignant cells relative to normal tissue, making it an attractive therapeutic target. In this study, we report that over 70% of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells express csGRP78. Interestingly, MDA-MB-231 cells predominantly exhibit a distinct unipolar morphology, with csGRP78 prominently co-localizing with the variant isoform of CD44 (CD44v, containing variable exon 3) at the anterior region of the cell. Co-localizations of csGRP78 and CD44v were also observed in MDA-MB-231 tumor xenografts, supporting its relevance in vivo. Importantly, targeting csGRP78 with the monoclonal antibody 76-E6 downregulated CD44v expression, inhibited Src kinase signaling, disrupted cell morphology, and suppressed cell motility. We further mapped the epitope of GRP78 targeted by 76-E6. Together, our findings identify csGRP78 as a functional regulator of cell morphology and migration at least in part via a csGRP78-CD44v axis and underscore its potential as a therapeutic target in TNBC."

A small cohort of patients with HER2-positive MBC, however, achieve such prolonged remission without relapse following anti-HER2 therapy and chemotherapy, that it is speculated they might be cured. The genomes of these patients might provide insights into the underlying mechanisms for their successful treatment. Here, a total of 243 HER2-positive patients diagnosed with MBC between 2000 and 2015 were studied. Of these, 29 patients were identified as exceptional responders (ExR) with an overall survival (OS) > 60 months and no evidence of relapse, 54 patients with an OS > 60 months but who relapsed or developed progressive disease were defined as exceptional survivors (ExS), and 160 patients with an OS < 60 months were identified as short-term responders (STR). Whole-Genome Sequencing and centromere copy number (CCN) analysis was performed on 27 patients (12 ExR; 4 ExS; 11 STR). A significant amplification was observed in the centromeric regions of ExR, exhibiting higher CCN compared to the ExS and STR. Digital PCR validation of chromosome 4 centromere region D4Z1 copy number was not associated with ExR OS. Our results suggest that the amplification of centromere regions are associated with very prolonged remission and survival in patients with HER2-positive MBC."

This system expands the editing capabilities of base editors by optimizing deaminase's spatial interaction with DNA, leading to improvements in efficiencies, window restrictions, and safety profiles. We validate Plug-in BE's versatility and high fidelity in cancer gene therapy and zebrafish embryo editing, demonstrating its potential as a powerful and adaptable tool for basic research and therapeutic applications.

Transcriptomic analyses of TCGA and single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed significant upregulation of MRPL17 in LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma) and LUSC (lung squamous cell carcinoma) tumor tissues, particularly within malignant epithelial and proliferating cancer cells. Elevated MRPL17 expression correlated with advanced stages, positive lymph node metastasis, and poorer overall survival. In vitro investigations demonstrated that silencing or knockout of MRPL17 attenuated cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion in NSCLC cells, while promoting apoptosis. Mechanistically, MRPL17 silencing impaired mitochondrial respiratory function, causing reduced oxygen consumption, diminished Complex I activity, and decreased ATP. These impairments were partially reversible by antioxidant treatment or glucose supplementation. Conversely, MRPL17 overexpression enhanced aggressive cellular phenotypes and mitochondrial energetic output. Bioinformatic analysis and subsequent experiments confirmed COX8A as a direct downstream target of MRPL17, mediating its pro-cancerous effects. In vivo, MRPL17 silencing suppressed NSCLC xenograft growth in nude mice, a phenomenon associated with reduced COX8A levels, mitochondrial dysfunction, heightened oxidative stress, and increased apoptosis. Thus, MRPL17 is an important pro-cancerous target in NSCLC, driving malignant progression through the regulation of mitochondrial function and cellular redox balance, with COX8A identified as a key mediator."

Although breast cancer's psychosocial burden extends to offspring caregivers, their trauma narratives and seeking of social support remain understudied, particularly in China. This study aimed to explore how adult offspring caregivers share trauma stories in online support groups (OSGs) and identify how narrative practices may facilitate self-healing. METHODS: We employed a mixed qualitative study approach - using large language models and thematic analysis to examine offspring caregivers' sentiment patterns and narrative characteristics at different treatment stages for the parent for whom they were caring. The sample comprised 705 posts and comments from offspring of breast cancer patients, collected from the Douban OSG \"Having a Breast Cancer Patient in My Family.\" RESULTS: At the early stage of treatment, most offspring caregivers of breast cancer patients exhibited negative sentiments. A combination of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments was observed in the middle stage. In the late stage, positive sentiments predominated. Furthermore, we identified three narrative themes aligning with sentiment trajectories among offspring caregivers: collapse, interactive, and constructive narratives. These findings suggest the self-healing function of media-based narratives. We argue that the deeper exploration of online trauma narratives related to breast cancer is necessary for more effectively conceptualizing the role of OSGs in providing health-related support. CONCLUSIONS: Trauma narration of offspring caregivers, particularly in online spaces, is an underexplored, but potentially crucial area. Our study revealed the role of the OSG impact on individual emotional and behavioral experiences that could be integrated into interventions to enhance psychological treatments."

In phase 1b part, the recommended dose of SHR-1701 was identified as 30 mg/kg every 3 weeks, when combined with AG. In phase 2 part, the primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). As of Mar 31, 2023, 56 patients were enrolled. Median follow-up was 10.3 months (range, 0.2-24.7). ORR was 32.1% (95% CI, 20.3-46.0). Median progressive-free survival (PFS) was 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.3-6.6), and median overall survival (OS) was 10.3 months (95% CI, 8.8-12.3). Treatment-related adverse events of grade >/=3 were reported in 27 (48.2%) patients, with the most common being decreased neutrophil count. Patients with PD-L1 TPS >/= 1% showed a higher ORR (66.7% vs. 25.0%), as well as extended median PFS (6.3 vs. 5.3 months) and median OS (18.8 vs. 9.9 months). Additionally, reduction of CA19-9 by at least 80% during treatment and pSMAD2/3 staining intensity of 1+ at baseline were potential monitoring tools and predictive biomarkers for better clinical outcomes, respectively.

This is best exemplified in Hodgkin lymphoma, where malignant cells constitute a minor fraction of the tumor and rely on signals from the microenvironment for survival. Using genome-wide transcriptional profiling with spatial and single-cell resolution, we show that the neighborhood around malignant cells forms a distinct niche of 31 non-malignant cell types, enriched in helper T cells and myeloid cells, but depleted of plasma cells. Moreover, our spatial analysis nominates IL13 as a candidate survival factor. Recombinant IL13 augments malignant cell growth in vitro, and genome-wide loss-of-function screens across >1000 human cancer cell lines identify IL4R and IL13RA1, heterodimeric components of the IL13 receptor, as uniquely essential in Hodgkin lymphoma.

Here, we show that a HSD inhibits melanoma growth independent of sodium accumulation and immune cells in skin and lung. Melanoma cells from mice on a HSD upregulated the metabolic inhibitor Tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), causing metabolic shutdown despite nutrient availability. Furthermore, Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), a crucial regulator of melanoma metabolism and differentiation, was upregulated, resulting in enhanced melanogenesis and cell cycle arrest. Thus, a HSD reversed the de-differentiation of melanoma cells and promoted their re-differentiation into a \"normal\" melanocytic state. These findings suggest that the anti-tumor effect of HSD may be tumor-specific and in some cases immune cell-independent."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: For early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly tumors less than 2 cm in diameter, sublobar resection-including wedge resection and segmentectomy-is often the preferred surgical approach. The difficulty of pulmonary segmentectomy lies in identifying the intersegmental planes. Among all segmental resections, S9 resection is considered one of the most challenging due to the cone-like structure of the S9 segment and its deeply hidden segmental portal. To address this, we designed a modified technique that identifies the S9 segmental plane by temporarily and sequentially occluding A9 + 10 and V10 intraoperatively, thereby avoiding dissection of the S9 segmental hilum. This method, which differs from traditional intersegmental plane identification based on occluding individual segmental arteries or veins, is termed the reverse watershed method. We compared it with the modified inflation-collapse method to explore its advantages and disadvantages in S9 resection. METHODS: We retrospectively collected 87 cases of thoracoscopic S9 resection. Patients were categorized into two groups based on the method used for intersegmental plane identification: the modified inflation-collapse method group and the reverse watershed method group. Various preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative indicators were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients with surgical data were included: 49 operated using the modified inflation-collapse technique and 34 using the reverse watershed method. Preoperative baseline characteristics showed no significant intergroup differences. Intraoperatively, the reverse watershed method group exhibited a reduced mean operative duration (p < 0.01) and diminished intraoperative blood loss (p < 0.01). Postoperatively, this group showed a lower incidence of air leaks, decreased chest tube drainage volume, and reduced pain severity compared to the modified inflation-collapse group. No significant differences were observed in the duration of chest tube retention, length of postoperative hospitalization, or loss of lung function at the 3-month postoperative review. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the modified inflation-collapse technique, the reverse watershed method reduces operative time and intraoperative bleeding in S9 resection, decreases the incidence of postoperative air leaks, and results in comparable preservation of lung function."

Its expression in adults is predominantly localized to pancreatic islets, small intestine, and colon. Extensive research has demonstrated that RFX6 regulates cellular processes, such as pancreatic development, differentiation of islet progenitor cells, and insulin secretion, through the modulation of specific miRNAs (such as miR145 and miR195) and mRNAs (such as Pdx1, Neurod1, GCK, and Abcc8). Hence, mutations and deletions in RFX6 have been linked to the onset of various types of diabetes, including type 2 diabetes, Maturity-onset diabetes of the young, neonatal diabetes mellitus, especially Mitchell-Riley Syndrome (MRS). Specifically, homozygous mutations in RFX6 impede the proper differentiation of pancreatic progenitor cells, leading to inhibition of pancreatic head-tail development and endocrine cell formation, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of MRS. Furthermore, examination of RFX6 target genes reveals a potential association with tumor development, indicating that RFX6 may play a role in cancer progression. Dysregulated expression or mutations of the RFX6 gene in prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, melanoma, and other tumors have garnered significant interest, with studies showing that such alterations affect tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and are correlated with an unfavorable clinical prognosis in patients carrying RFX6 mutations. This review delves into the various functions of RFX6, emphasizing its crucial regulatory roles in pancreatic development, tumorigenesis, and progression. In addition, recent advancements in MRS therapy are outlined, underscoring the importance of RFX6-targeted therapy in MRS and cancer."

While several validated algorithms exist-such as NICE NG12, HSE, IOTA Simple Rules, O-RADS v2022, RMI2, and ROMA-each evaluates different aspects of risk, and none provide an integrated, clinically actionable output. We developed MOCRA (Multivariate Ovarian Cancer Risk Assessment), a deterministic, rule-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) designed to harmonize these tools into a unified risk stratification. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center diagnostic accuracy study included 68 analyzable patients with adnexal masses. MOCRA encoded six validated diagnostic algorithms using object-oriented architecture and combined their outputs through transparent precedence rules to produce a four-level risk classification (low, intermediate, high, indeterminate). Diagnostic performance was evaluated against physician-confirmed outcomes (histopathology or >/= 6-month follow-up). Functional reliability was assessed using predefined test cases, and usability was evaluated by 15 gynecologic oncologists using the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ). RESULTS: Among 68 patients (7 malignant, 61 benign), MOCRA achieved an accuracy of 97.1%, sensitivity 100.0%, specificity 96.7%, F1-score 87.5%, and AUC 0.984. No malignancies occurred in the MOCRA low-risk category. Compared with single algorithms, MOCRA reduced false negatives while maintaining high specificity by cross-validating symptom, biomarker, and ultrasound signals. Functional testing confirmed deterministic and stable performance (mean reliability 4.8/5). Usability ratings were uniformly positive (overall PSSUQ score 4.6/5), with clinicians highlighting the interpretability of the four-tier risk level and the clarity provided by side-by-side algorithm outputs. CONCLUSIONS: MOCRA demonstrates strong diagnostic performance and high clinician usability in this pilot evaluation, suggesting that deterministic integration of multiple validated algorithms can improve consistency and reduce missed high-risk cases. However, the small, single-center dataset-particularly the limited number of malignant cases-warrants cautious interpretation. Larger multicenter and prospective studies with extended follow-up are needed to confirm generalizability and real-world clinical impact."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer resistance is one of the major challenges in oncology, often resulting in disease relapse and poor patient outcomes. Within the RNA family, microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate core biological processes and have been recognized also as critical contributors of tumor resistance and therapy failure. Being pivotal, they are increasingly exploited as biomarkers in various settings. Although in silico analyses facilitate miRNAs identification, PCR-based approaches remain essential to validate their expression. Currently, a plethora of well-established, single-target methods exist but multiplex detection from the same input have been only rarely explored. METHODS: We present miRquad, the first-in-class digital PCR (dPCR) TaqMan multiplex clinical research assay for miRNA detection in head and neck (HNC) cancers. Based on a patented prognostic signature including miR-21-5p, miR-96-5p, miR-21-3p and miR-429, the assay would enable simultaneous miRNA analysis via qPCR and dPCR on multiple clinically relevant sample types. RESULTS: We designed and optimized miRquad using both synthetic controls and retrospective patient-derived tissues, sera and saliva. A multicentre ring study was conducted to evaluate assay reliability across different platforms, demonstrating strong correlation with commercial singleplexes, broad applicability, reduced turnaround time (TAT) and cost-effectiveness. Finally, we provide evidence for its potential clinical application to predict disease outcome in HNC, testing miRquad on tumoral and peritumoral tissues, sera and saliva samples collected throughout patient follow up. CONCLUSIONS: The assay overcomes common challenges associated with multiple miRNAs detection, particularly in liquid biopsy samples (e.g., multiple pipetting issues, increased consumption of sample for multiple assessment, extended TAT for complete profiling) and provides robust and accurate detection, demonstrating potential for real-time patient monitoring and prognostication in HNC."

This study aimed to develop an engineered LM strain that induces metabolic reprogramming while enhancing antitumor efficacy through multimodal immune activation. RESULTS: We encapsulated cepharanthine nanoparticles (CEP NPs) into a double-gene attenuated LM strain via electroporation, resulting in the induction of metabolic reprogramming and the emergence of a 'zombie-like' phenotypic state (LM(e)@CEP). This modification disrupted folate metabolism to induce bacterial metabolic dormancy, while triggering a cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) surge that amplified STING-mediated immunogenicity. The CEP payload localized to tumors and exerted dual cytotoxic effects by simultaneously inducing ferroptosis and apoptosis in situ. These direct tumoricidal effects synergize with the immunostimulatory capacity of LM(e)@CEP, effectively modulating the tumor immune microenvironment and exerting robust antitumor effects. Preclinical validation across multiple murine tumor models and ex vivo human tumor specimens confirmed the therapeutic versatility of the platform. Furthermore, results in STING(-/-) mice corroborated that LM(e)@CEP's antitumor effectiveness partly depends on STING pathway activation, and its therapeutic potential may be further enhanced by PD-L1 blockade, thereby mitigating STING-driven immune suppression. CONCLUSIONS: These findings establish metabolic hijacking of bacterial vectors as a paradigm-shifting strategy that integrates direct tumor killing with multimodal immune activation, overcoming key barriers in microbial immunotherapy."

Melatonin supplementation could be a potential strategy. AIMS: The MEQAPAG trial investigated the effects of melatonin supplementation on this specific population's quality of life. METHODS: A multi-centre, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial was implemented. Patients in the interventional arm received a daily dose of melatonin (2 mg/j for 90 days, 1-2 h before bedtime and after a meal) for the first three months of a new systemic treatment line. The primary endpoint was QoL assessment using the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) before and after supplementation. Among the secondary objectives, we evaluated the impact of supplementation on sleep and on urinary melatonin concentrations. We also studied safety and survival. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-three patients were included in the study between July 2015 and January 2021. The trial was prematurely terminated due to futility. Only 61% (n = 59) of the patients were assessable and considered as compliant (i.e., at least two months of supplementation), 30 and 29 were allocated to the experimental and control groups respectively. Median age was 76 years (range [70, 88]). No difference in the QLQ-C30 questionnaire global score was shown. After the supplementation, the aMT6s concentration is 8,4 ng/mg creatinine (range [0.15, 201], IQI [0.99, 105]) in the experimental group. CONCLUSION: In an older cancer population, supplementation with 2 mg melatonin was safe but did not lead to any significant improvement in the global quality of life score on the QLQ-C30 for compliant patients.

Functional enrichment, immune-cell infiltration, mutational profiles and predicted drug responses were analyzed, and a PLAAT2-related prognostic signature was generated by LASSO-Cox analysis and validated in external GEO datasets. In parallel, PLAAT2 expression was examined in paired PC tissues and matched non-cancerous counterparts by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative RT-PCR. The effects of PLAAT2 silencing on proliferation, migration, invasion and oxaliplatin sensitivity were evaluated in MiaPaCa-2 and CFPAC-1 cells. RESULTS: PLAAT2 levels were substantially higher in PC specimens, and tumours with high PLAAT2 expression tended to exhibit more advanced grade and stage together with poorer survival. High PLAAT2 expression was enriched in lipid-metabolic pathways and linked to an immune-dysregulated microenvironment characterized by reduced CD8(+) T-cell infiltration and increased macrophages. The PLAAT2-high cohort also exhibited a higher frequency of somatic mutations, particularly in KRAS and TP53. An 11-gene PLAAT2-related signature stratified patients into distinct risk groups; high-risk patients showed significantly worse survival and lower predicted sensitivity to irinotecan, olaparib and oxaliplatin, and these findings were consistently validated in independent GEO cohorts. In an institutional cohort of 15 paired clinical samples, IHC and qRT-PCR confirmed higher PLAAT2 expression in tumor tissues than in adjacent non-tumor tissues. Functionally, PLAAT2 knockdown in MiaPaCa-2 and CFPAC-1 cells suppressed cell growth, migration and invasion and significantly enhanced the growth-inhibitory effect of oxaliplatin, accompanied by reduced IC(5)(0) values. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these data support an oncogenic role of PLAAT2 in PC and indicate that PLAAT2 and its associated transcriptional signature may serve as potential biomarkers of prognosis and chemotherapeutic response, as well as candidate targets for precision therapy in PC."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) represents a novel noninvasive cancer treatment method which uses ultrasound (US) to activate sonosensitizers that produce cytotoxic effects in deep tissues by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). The clinical application of this therapy faces obstacles related to tumor localization and complications in real-time monitoring. METHODS: This systematic review evaluates recent preclinical advances in computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) -guided SDT using nano contrast agents (NCAs). A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from January 2015 to March 2025 identified 26 eligible studies. Data on nanoconstruct design, imaging mechanisms, therapeutic outcomes, and translational potential were extracted and assessed. RESULTS: The majority of studies utilized MRI-guided SDT systems that applied gadolinium or manganese-based NCAs to enhance soft tissue contrast and provide real-time monitoring capabilities. High-atomic-number nanoparticles were used in CT-guided SDT to achieve improved anatomical resolution. The dual-modal platforms showed better tumor visualization along with stronger ROS production and tumor regression while keeping systemic toxicity to a minimum. CONCLUSION: The CT/MRI-guided SDT provides a promising theranostic method to achieve precise and effective cancer treatment. Clinical translation demands standardized protocols alongside clinically relevant models and thorough safety evaluations."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Identifying biomarkers associated with pancreatic cancer (PC) development could facilitate early intervention and improve outcomes. METHODS: This study enrolled 206,363 participants, with 854 incident cases of PC were identified during follow-up. 168 metabolic biomarkers were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and the polygenic risk score (PRS) for PC constructed by 44 single nucleotide polymorphisms was calculated. Multivariate Cox regression analysis and multiple hypothesis testing were employed to evaluate the association between metabolites and PC risk. Stratified analyses and interaction tests were conducted to explore the effects of metabolites under different genetic backgrounds and lifestyle factors. RESULTS: After correction for multiple hypothesis testing, only plasma glycine levels showed a significant inverse correlation with PC risk (FDR-corrected P-value <0.05). High glycine levels were associated with a 21.4 % reduction in PC risk compared to low levels (HR: 0.786, 95 % CI: 0.657-0.940). PRS was positively associated with PC risk, with high PRS participants showing a 2.871-fold increased risk (95 % CI: 2.382-3.460). Glycine's protective effects were more pronounced in low PRS participants and never smokers. High glycine and low PRS participants demonstrated a 72.3 % reduction in PC risk compared to low glycine and high PRS participants (HR: 0.277, 95 % CI: 0.197-0.389). Notably, even among participants with the highest PRS, baseline plasma glycine levels were still significantly inversely associated with future PC risk. CONCLUSION: Higher circulating glycine levels are associated with a reduced risk of PC, even in individuals with the highest genetic susceptibility. These findings suggest that higher circulating glycine levels may hold potential for PC prevention strategies, warranting further experimental validation of glycine supplementation in prospective trials."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Staging laparoscopy (SL) is performed to detect occult metastases in patients with localized pancreatic cancer. However, current guideline recommendations vary widely on routinely performing SL. This global survey investigated use and indications of SL. METHODS: An online survey was sent to members of nine international societies and working groups. Information was obtained about SL use, indications SL and adjunct diagnostic modalities across four clinical scenarios. RESULTS: Among 617 responding surgeons (76 countries, six continents), 82% used SL which varied between regions (Americas 90%, Asia 85%, Oceania 81%, Europe 76%, Africa 59%; P < 0.050). Most perform SL during the same session as the scheduled laparotomy (63-79%). A SL was mainly performed at the time of upfront surgery (71%), after (60%) or before (37%) neoadjuvant/induction therapy, and before radiotherapy (31%). SL was mainly performed in selected patients, either based on indeterminate/suspicious lesions on cross-sectional imaging (78-87%), resectability status (54-64%), and/or elevated CA19-9 level (60-69%). Most common used adjuncts were cytological lavage (37-55%) and intra-abdominal liver ultrasonography (36-50%). CONCLUSION: Despite considerable global variability, SL is widely used to detect occult metastases in pancreatic cancer, mainly in high-risk patients and often during the scheduled laparotomy. The observed variability highlights the need for more evidence leading to stronger guideline recommendations."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Intravesical recurrence after induction bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy is common in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), but longitudinal, real-world data using contemporary definitions of the BCG-exposed (BCG-E) phenotype remain limited, which constrains trial design. We assessed long-term clinical outcomes and clinical trajectories for a large BCG-exposed cohort treated at a single tertiary care center to establish pragmatic benchmarks to inform patient counseling, surveillance strategies, and the design and interpretation of bladder-sparing studies. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study for adults with histologically confirmed high-grade NMIBC treated with intravesical BCG at Moffitt Cancer Center between 1988 and 2024. Relevant clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records into a prespecified database, including detailed BCG doses and timing and features of each recurrence episode. Initial management followed contemporary standards, with subsequent intravesical therapy or radical cystectomy (RC) after shared decision-making. Patients were classified as BCG-unresponsive (BCG-UR) or BCG-E, with BCG adequacy defined as previously published. Time-to-event endpoints were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models; baseline characteristics were compared using Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Of 1076 NMIBC patients treated with BCG, 470 were classifiable: 245 (52.1%) were BCG-E, of whom 173 (70.6%) were resistant and 72 (29.4%) experienced delayed relapse, and 225 (47.9%) were BCG-UR. In the BCG-E group, 50.2% experienced recurrence and 15.5% experienced progression; median recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 27.2 mo. The 5-yr survival rate estimates were 32.25% for RFS, 79.3% for progression-free survival (PFS), 84.5% for metastasis-free survival (MFS), and 65.0% for overall survival (OS). Recurrence was associated with worse PFS (p < 0.001) and MFS (p = 0.03), but not OS (p = 0.2). RC was performed in 45 patients (18.4%). No consistent survival differences were observed across salvage therapies (62.0% BCG, 18.4% gemcitabine + docetaxel, 5.3% single-agent chemotherapy, 1.2% trials, 13% surveillance),. Multivariable OS estimates were computed. Addition of recurrence to the model did not improve discrimination; age and performance status were the strongest predictors of OS. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: We present comprehensive outcomes for and an in-depth characterization of clinical trajectories in BCG-E NMIBC, for which salvage intravesical BCG is predominant and oncologic results are durable. These data provide pragmatic benchmarks for the interpretation and design of bladder-sparing trials in this setting."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is widely used for localised prostate cancer (PC). As surgical techniques and oncological outcomes have matured, attention has increasingly turned to patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and experience measures (PREMs), driven not only by interest in functional recovery but also by broader health care trends, including shared decision-making, patient empowerment, and value-based care models. Digital health platforms may facilitate this evolution, yet real-world evidence on their feasibility and impact is limited. Our objective was to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and clinical relevance of digital telemonitoring using a certified mobile health application after RARP. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multicentre cohort study involving 465 patients undergoing RARP across 32 French centres. All used the Betty digital health platform for perioperative monitoring. The primary outcome was patient-reported satisfaction with perioperative care. Secondary outcomes were pain trajectories, analgesic use, urinary continence, erectile function, and correlations between satisfaction and recovery endpoints. PROM data were collected preoperatively and up to 6 mo postoperatively. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: The questionnaire completion rate at 6 wk was 86%. Satisfaction was high (median score 9-10), and pain and analgesic use declined steadily over 30 d. The pad-free rate was 59% at 6 wk and 78% at 6 mo. International Index of Erectile Function-5 scores remained low (median 3, interquartile range 1-5 at 6 mo). Satisfaction was correlated with lower pain at postoperative day 7 (r = -0.391, p = 0.001), lower incontinence scores (r = -0.324, p = 0.009), and less impact of incontinence (r = -0.420, p = 0.002). The main limitations are the inclusion of only app users and the absence of nerve-sparing data. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Certified digital telemonitoring after RARP is feasible, well accepted, and linked to high satisfaction. Early pain and continence recovery influence the patient experience. These results support the integration of structured PROM/PREM tracking into standard pathways for real-time monitoring and patient-centred care."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bladder cancer is the most common tumor of the urinary tract and the ninth most common cancer worldwide. Our objective was to describe and interpret current geographic variations in bladder cancer incidence and mortality rates using updated national estimates and recorded data from population-based cancer registries alongside national vital statistics. METHODS: The bladder cancer incidence and mortality for 185 countries by sex were obtained from GLOBOCAN (International Agency for Research on Cancer) for the year 2022. Recorded incidence and mortality data were retrieved from national or subnational population-based cancer registries included in the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents series and the World Health Organization database, respectively. Corresponding age-standardized rates (ASRs) per 100000 person-years were calculated using direct standardization (world standard), and temporal trends of ASRs by calendar period and sex are presented by country, with the direction and magnitude of recent trends quantified using the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC). KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: In 2022, an estimated 614298 new cases of bladder cancer and 220596 deaths occurred worldwide, with approximately 75% of the burden observed in males. Urothelial and squamous cell carcinomas were the predominant histological subtypes across all regions. Incidence and mortality rates varied substantially across regions and countries, with the highest rates reported in Europe, particularly in southern (ASR: 28.7) and northern (20.4) regions, and elevated rates were also seen in North America (18.0), Northern Africa (16.3), and Western Asia (15.2). Despite lower age-standardized rates, Eastern Asia reported the highest absolute numbers due to its large population. Temporal trends indicate a stabilizing or declining incidence in many high-income countries. Mortality rates have overall declined across many populations, for example, in Australia (EAPC in male: -2.6; female: -2.3), the Netherlands (male: 2.9; female: -1.6), and the USA (male: -1.3; female: -1.0). Interpretation of bladder cancer incidence patterns and trends requires caution given possible variations in cancer registration practice, notably as to whether noninvasive tumors are included in reporting. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Bladder cancer continues to pose a significant global health challenge, with marked geographic and sex-based disparities in the incidence and mortality. While encouraging declines in rates are observed in many high-income countries, the burden remains substantial in these regions and rates are rising in some settings. Tobacco smoking remains the predominant risk factor, with historical and current prevalence patterns aligned closely with disease trends. However, in Northern Africa, schistosomiasis contributes to an elevated incidence and a distinct histological profile. Interpretation of these patterns is complex given the potential variations in registration practice, with respect to reporting of noninvasive tumors."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tumor micronecrosis is a feature of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and might mirror tumor characteristics and patient prognosis. However, the specific influence of tumor micronecrosis on the recurrence patterns of HCC remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of tumor micronecrosis on HCC recurrence patterns, particularly examining any changes after liver resection. METHODS: A cohort of 938 patients with primary HCC who underwent R0 liver resection between June 2014 and October 2019 were included in the study. A second R0 resection was performed in 340 patients with tumor recurrence between November 2014 and October 2021. Tumor micronecrosis was evaluated for primary (938 cases) and recurrent (340 cases) tumors. The recurrence pattern and prognosis were analyzed, and independent prognostic factors were identified using Cox regression analysis. Nomograms were then constructed to predict tumor recurrence and prognosis after liver resection. RESULTS: HCC recurrence was observed in 400 (42.6%) patients during the follow-up period. Tumor micronecrosis independently affected recurrence-free survival (P = 0.002). Among micronecrosis (+) patients, a higher extrahepatic recurrence, multiple tumors, elevated albumin-bilirubin grade, advanced Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage, and increased alpha-fetoprotein level were observed. Additionally, more micronecrosis (-) patients underwent positive treatments after recurrence (P = 0.017), leading to a superior post-recurrence prognosis in this group (P < 0.001). Nearly half of the recurrent HCCs displayed changes in tumor micronecrosis scores. The presence of micronecrosis in primary lesions was significantly associated with poor patient survival after recurrence (P = 0.006), whereas no significant association was observed in patients with recurrent lesions after second R0 resection (P = 0.138). Furthermore, early recurrence, multinodular recurrence, intrahepatic and extrahepatic recurrent tumors, and the treatment modality were identified as independent prognostic factors. The developed nomogram for patient survival achieved a concordance index of 0.753. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HCC displaying tumor micronecrosis experienced increased recurrent risks and more aggressive recurrent patterns, and encountered poorer prognosis compared to those without micronecrosis. Notably, micronecrosis status often varied between primary and recurrent HCCs. However, micronecrosis predicted survival only when evaluated in the primary tumor, not in the recurrent tumors."

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer, mainly pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), is aggressive with poor prognosis. Because its clinical manifestations appear at advanced stages, only less than 20 % of patients with PDAC can undergo radical surgery. Chemotherapy, with strong toxic side effects, remains the main therapy. Therefore, developing more effective strategies for PDAC is warranted. Because of its heterogeneity and highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), the discovery of new drug targets and development of new therapeutic modalities for PDAC remain difficult. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)-which have demonstrated efficacy against various types of cancers-improve the antitumor effects of a drug by enhancing tumor targeting, reducing toxic side effects, and increasing TME interactions via antigen presentation regulation and immunosuppressive cell inhibition. Here, we summarized the effects of ADCs on TME of PDAC, as well as the future research prospects."

    "abstract": "T cells have traditionally been characterized as autonomous killers that eliminate malignant cells through single-cell cytotoxicity. However, recent findings reveal that tumor-reactive T cells frequently form tightly bound clusters on the tumor surface, functioning as cooperative hyper-effector units. These clusters establish stable and reinforced immune synapses, sustain prolonged engagement with tumor targets, and coordinate the delivery of perforin, granzymes, and proinflammatory cytokines. As a result, they exhibit markedly enhanced tumor-killing capacity compared with unbound T cells in both ex vivo assays and murine models. This discovery introduces an essential spatial and mechanical dimension to cancer immunology and challenges the prevailing assumption that molecular phenotype alone defines T-cell efficacy. The implications are substantial, extending to tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy optimization, the refinement of immunotherapy biomarkers, and the engineering of next-generation CAR-T and CAR-NK platforms. Enriching or mimicking the behavior of cluster-forming T cells may accelerate clinical responses and overcome barriers associated with solid tumors. Collectively, these insights reposition T-cell clustering as a fundamental determinant of effective antitumor immunity."

    "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection remains highly prevalent in Mexico and worldwide. In response to the advances in diagnosis, treatment, and epidemiologic surveillance, the Asociacion Mexicana de Gastroenterologia, through a multidisciplinary panel of experts, developed the \"Fifth Mexican Consensus on H. pylori\" in 2025, providing 38 evidence-based recommendations tailored to the Mexican context. The document highlights the establishment of the Hp-MexReg national registry and its collaboration with Hp-LatamReg and HpRESLA projects, enabling the collection of local data on eradication rates and antimicrobial resistance. The expert group reaffirms the high prevalence of H. pylori in Mexico (70.5%) related to social and sanitation factors, as well as the increase of antibiotic-resistant strains, particularly to clarithromycin and levofloxacin. Regarding diagnosis, the 13C-urea breath test is prioritized as the first-line noninvasive method and eradication of the bacterium should be confirmed at least four weeks after treatment. Regarding treatment, quadruple therapies, with or without bismuth, are recommended over standard triple therapy, and potassium-competitive acid blockers are endorsed as an effective alternative to high-dose proton pump inhibitors. H. pylori eradication is strongly recommended, with emphasis on the clinical scenarios in which it is indicated. The present consensus underscores the need to continue conducting national studies that enable strategies to be adapted to Mexico's epidemiologic reality."

DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial with blinded assessors, concealed allocation and intention-to-treat analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-eight women reporting urinary incontinence (UI) after treatment for gynaecological cancer. INTERVENTIONS: Experimental group participants were allocated to undertake telerehabilitation sessions including pelvic floor muscle training once a week for 12 weeks. The control group received usual care. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the prevalence of UI on the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI-SF). The secondary outcomes were: the impact of UI on quality of life (ICIQ-UI-SF), sexual function (Female Sexual Function Index), dyspareunia (numerical assessment scale), self-esteem (Rosenberg), pain (numerical assessment scale), faecal incontinence, stool consistency, vaginal stenosis, quality of life (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire) and level of physical activity. After 12 weeks, the telerehab group also responded about treatment satisfaction, adherence and system usability. RESULTS: After 12 weeks, the experimental group had better outcomes than the control group in several areas: prevalence of UI (RD -0.45, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.23); total ICIQ-UI-SF score (MD -9.5, 95% CI -11.8 to -7.1); pelvic pain (MD -3.1, 95% CI -4.7 to -1.4); self-esteem (MD 2.9, 95% CI 0.7 to 5.1); and measures of vaginal stenosis and quality of life. CONCLUSION: A 12-week telerehabilitation program was effective in reducing reports of UI, severity of UI, pelvic pain and dyspareunia in women after the treatment of gynaecological cancer.

This study aimed to provide an overview of available evidence on AI applications in supportive care for individuals with colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: This scoping review was conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines. Studies published between 2014 and 2025 were retrieved from six databases: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO, using a combination of search terms relevant to \"colorectal cancer,\" \"artificial intelligence,\" and \"supportive care.\" Data on study characteristics, participants, settings, types of AI technologies, and supportive care dimensions were extracted for analysis. RESULTS: Out of 1,792 articles, 40 were identified as eligible for inclusion in this scoping review. AI applications for CRC supportive care are primarily in early development, focusing on machine learning-based prediction models that provide informational support for post-surgical side effects. The use of AI for physical support in symptom management and emotional support during cancer treatment and beyond was limited. CONCLUSION: Implementing AI technology offers an opportunity to enhance supportive care for patients with CRC. This study suggests that current AI applications for CRC supportive care primarily focus on informational support, underscoring the need for further development of AI to provide comprehensive support, including psychological, social, spiritual, and practical aspects. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Further research is needed to develop AI-driven tools that comprehensively address the supportive care needs of cancer patients and enhance their outcomes."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer, one of the most prevalent cancers among women, not only results in significant physical changes but also causes considerable emotional distress and disruptions in social roles and relationships. While depression is the most commonly observed psychiatric disorder in cancer patients, there is a lack of sufficient research on the effectiveness, potential drug interactions, and side effects of antidepressants in this population. This gap underscores the increasing need for non-pharmacological approaches, such as psychotherapy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) in addressing psychosocial challenges faced by breast cancer patients. METHODS: This systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42024576746). A systematic literature search was conducted across five databases: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Ovid MEDLINE. The review was carried out according to PRISMA guidelines. Study selection and data extraction were independently performed by two researchers using the Covidence platform. Disagreements were resolved through discussion to reach consensus. RESULTS: Four studies (two randomized controlled trials [RCTs], two pilots) met inclusion criteria. IPT significantly reduced depression, anxiety, and psychological distress, with some studies also reporting improvements in quality of life. One study showed strong effect sizes (Cohen's d > 1.0) for depression. Telephone-based IPT was feasible and beneficial. Findings support IPT as an effective psychosocial intervention for breast cancer patients. CONCLUSION: IPT appears to be an effective intervention for reducing anxiety and depression and enhancing quality of life in patients with breast cancer. However, further high-quality, large-scale RCTs are needed to strengthen the evidence base and confirm its clinical utility."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Unless greater awareness inspires action, lung cancer will become the next global public health emergency. Despite improvements in screening, diagnosis, and treatments, more must be done because global incidence continues to increase. Concerted action must address the burden both between and within countries. Inequalities result from the uneven distribution of resources while inequities result from differences in prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment. METHOD: Participants in the 9th International Lung Cancer Network conference (Athens, June 2023) received an advanced draft of the declaration with a confidentiality notice by email upon completion of online registration. They were invited to provide comments and suggestions up to seven days before the meeting. All contributions were reviewed by the authors and incorporated into the final version circulated the day before the meeting began. Although not a formal Delphi-style process, this approach prioritized inclusivity, transparency, and broad endorsement. Outreach extended beyond onsite attendees, ensuring diverse perspectives and representation. This process complements methodological consensus approaches by uniting stakeholders around shared policy goals. RESULTS: At the 9th International Lung Cancer Network conference, participants were invited to sign the final declaration, and 785 did so. Since then, 20 organizations worldwide have formally endorsed the Consensus Statement, and support continues to grow. The inclusive design has fostered broad and sustained backing, underscoring the value of the Statement as a unifying policy declaration advancing shared principles. CONCLUSION: The Consensus Statement, Bridging the Gap in the Diagnosis and Management of Lung Cancer, reinforces five unifying principles: improve and expand prevention; focus on early detection; ensure equitable and sustainable access to treatment; build partnerships and promote investment; and, combat stigma, recognizing it as a social determinant of public health."

However, the impact of GTC on survival outcomes in patients with invasive breast cancer remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the association between GTC on preoperative breast US and survival outcomes in women with invasive breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 2889 patients with invasive breast cancer who underwent preoperative breast US between January 2013 and December 2018. GTC was qualitatively assessed on US and categorized as low (minimal or mild) or high (moderate or marked). Associations of GTC with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression model. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on menopausal status and molecular subtype. RESULTS: Of the 2889 patients, 966 (33.4%) had high GTC and 1923 (66.6%) had low GTC. In the overall cohort, high GTC was associated with worse DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.42 [95% CI: 1.17, 1.71]; P < .001), but not associated with OS (HR, 1.02 [95% CI: 0.81, 1.30]; P = .847). In the postmenopausal group, high GTC was associated with worse OS and DFS (HR, 1.68 [95% CI: 1.15, 2.46], P = .007; DFS: HR, 1.43 [95% CI: 1.05, 1.95], P = .022). In triple-negative breast cancers, high GTC was associated with worse OS and DFS (OS: HR, 2.22 [95% CI: 1.28, 3.87], P = .005; DFS: HR, 1.61 [95% CI: 1.04, 2.51], P = .035). CONCLUSION: Glandular tissue component at preoperative breast US was independently associated with survival outcome in patients with invasive breast cancer. If further validated, this finding may help refine prognostic risk stratification in clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Metabolic steatotic diseases affect 16.7% of the French population, i.e. approximately 8 million individuals. Approximately 60% of type 2 diabetes patients have hepatic steatosis, 30% of whom also have fibrosis. The progression of fibrosis, linked to systemic inflammation, is associated with a significant increase in cardiovascular and cancer mortality (particularly hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma). In 2023, an international reform of the nomenclature led to the replacement of the old terminology \"non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)\" and \"non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)\" in order to better reflect the metabolic causes. The following terms were defined: \"steatotic liver disease (SLD)\", which refers to all forms of steatosis, \"metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)\", which explicitly includes metabolic factors, and \"metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)\", which emphasizes histologically confirmed metabolic steatohepatitis. A new entity, \"metabolic alcohol-related liver disease (MetALD),\" refers to MASLD with moderate but regular alcohol consumption. The definition of \"alcohol-related liver disease (ALD)\" remains unchanged (alcohol consumption greater than 50-60g/day). \"Cryptogenic steatosis\" includes cases with no known cause. This new classification allows for the continued use of previous data and aims to improve patient stratification for personalized treatments."

This study evaluated radiologic and pathologic responses to immunotherapy in resectable recurrent high-grade SGCs. We retrospectively analyzed 108 patients from a tertiary center: 41 received neoadjuvant immunotherapy, while 67 underwent upfront surgery. Radiologic response (RECIST 1.1) and pathologic response (immune-related criteria) were discordant-34.1 % showed partial radiologic responses, but only 9.8 % achieved partial pathologic responses, with no complete responses. PD-L1 amplification correlated with response (25 % vs. 8.1 % in non-responders, p = 0.042), whereas B2M loss (29.3 % post-treatment, p = 0.032) and TP53/PIK3CA co-mutations (37.8 % in non-responders) were linked to resistance. Survival did not differ between groups (3-year event-free survival: 19.5 % vs. 23.9 %, p = 0.447; overall survival: 26.8 % vs. 31.3 %, p = 0.593). These findings highlight immunotherapy's limited pathologic efficacy in recurrent high-grade SGCs, with response rates lower on pathologic than radiologic assessment.

PLGA was selected for its well-established biomedical applications, including targeted drug delivery and antibacterial activity. This study focuses on synthesizing 200nm AlPc NPs by using the single emulsion solvent evaporation method and characterizing them via spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. This study demonstrates that AlPc NPs' encapsulation efficiency is 82% and drug loading efficiency is 10%. The drug release profile shows 52% release of AlPc NPs within 24hours. Cellular uptake of free AlPc and AlPc NPs was examined using confocal fluorescence imaging. The in vitro investigation used Hep-2C human laryngeal cancer cells to assess the dark and phototoxic effects of free AlPc and AlPc NPs for PDT. MTT results show that the cells treated with AlPc NPs had lower cell viability than cells treated with free AlPc at the same drug doses, which confirms improved efficacy of AlPc NPs. Moreover, AlPc NPs improved the antibacterial potential against the Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacterial strain and increased their bioavailability."

    "abstract": "One of the important markers that distinguish tumor cells from normal cells is metabolic reprogramming. Among them, the reprogramming of fatty acid metabolism not only supports the fuel supply for energy but also meets the needs of rapid biosynthesis, providing selective growth advantages for tumor cells to resist harsh microenvironments. Due to the crucial role of fatty acid metabolic reprogramming in tumor metabolism, its various functions in cancer have attracted more and more attention. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms of fatty acid metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells and the series of responses (such as active ferroptosis signaling), analyze the potential impacts brought by fatty acid metabolic reprogramming in various human cancers and focus on the significance of targeting fatty acid metabolic pathways and dietary control in cancer treatment."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To establish a prediction model to triage difficult esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in order to reduce complications. METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 742 patients who underwent ESD for early esophageal cancer and precancerous lesions. Difficult ESDs were defined as those meeting any of the following criteria: (1) long procedure time (>/= 90 min), (2) occurrence of intraoperative adverse events (muscularis propria injury, perforation, and massive hemorrhage), or (3) piecemeal resection. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the predictors of technical difficulty. Then we developed a score prediction model according to the Framingham system for the first time and presented a convenient table containing the risk probability for each patient. In addition, the score model was validated in the validation cohort. RESULTS: The risk factors for difficult ESDs were as follows: lesion total length 4-6 cm (1 point), 7-9 cm (2 points) or >/=10 cm (3 points); lesion >/= 2/3 circumference (2 points); preoperative invasion depth extending to submucosa (2 points). Areas under ROC curves for the score model in the derivation and validation sets were 0.768 (95% CI, 0.726-0.811) and 0.719 (95% CI, 0.646-0.793), respectively. In addition, the percentage of difficult ESDs in easy (score = 0), intermediate (score = 1-2), difficult (score = 3-4), and very difficult (score >/=5) categories were 14.8%, 36.1%, 62.6%, and 87.5% in the derivation cohort and 14.8%, 33.7%, 56.3%, and 68.8% in the internal validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully established a prediction model to assess the difficulty of esophageal ESD and it can provide a scientific basis for clinical management to reduce complications."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast, cervical, and oral cancers are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in Bangladesh, placing a heavy disease and economic burden on households and the health system. Yet, this burden remains poorly understood, as no prior study has comprehensively examined their economic impact. Moreover, the profound psychological suffering experienced by patients are often overlooked in existing global evidence This study aims to estimate the comprehensive economic burden of breast, cervical, and oral cancers in Bangladesh from the household perspective. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, primary data were collected through structured interviews with 346 adult cancer patients. A cost-of-illness approach was employed. Direct medical and direct non-medical costs were estimated based on respondent-reported expenditures. Indirect costs, including productivity losses, were calculated using the human capital approach. Intangible costs, reflecting psychological distress, were quantified using the willingness-to-pay method. RESULTS: The average total cost per patient was US$12,117, with breast cancer accounting for the highest burden. Intangible costs comprised 47.7% of the total, underscoring the substantial psychological impact of cancer on patients. The combined national economic burden exceeded US$1.17 billion. Catastrophic health expenditure was nearly universal (99.1%), with average treatment costs exceeding the catastrophic threshold by 44-fold. Expenditures were significantly higher among wealthier households, patients with longer disease duration, and those seeking care from multiple facilities. CONCLUSION: Breast, cervical, and oral cancers impose a major financial and psychological burden on Bangladeshi households. The near-universal catastrophic health expenditure and high intangible costs highlight the urgent need for equitable financing and accessible, affordable care. POLICY SUMMARY: Policies should strengthen financial protection, decentralize diagnosis and treatment, introduce insurance with cancer-specific benefits, establish an effective referral system, integrate psychosocial support and strengthen early detection programs."

But their performance and reliability remain uncertain. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the predictive accuracy and methodological quality of these models. We comprehensively searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies reporting on ML/AI models for predicting RITs in HNC patients. Eligible studies were assessed for bias risk using the PROBAST tool, and key performance metrics, including the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), were extracted. A hierarchical multilevel meta-analysis was performed to estimate pooled AUC values, and subgroup analyses explored the influence of study characteristics on model performance. A total of 67 studies with a total of 568 models were included, showing moderate discriminatory power of ML/AI models, with a pooled AUC = 0.76; 95 % CI: 0.73-0.78. Nonetheless, substantial heterogeneity was observed across studies. Incorporating imaging biomarkers significantly improved model performance. Prospective and internal validation showed comparable performance; external validation shows true generalizability. The predominance of retrospective designs and variability in predictor selection may have introduced bias, affecting model reliability and generalisability. ML/AI models hold promise for predicting RITs in HNC patients, but methodological constraints limit their applicability. Standardised and transparent reporting of model development and validation processes is vital for improving comparability among studies. Future research should explore hybrid modelling methods and the integration of clinical, dosimetric, radiomic, and genomic data to boost predictive accuracy."

The CAPItello-281 trial is the first phase III trial to evaluate AKT inhibition added at start of androgen deprivation therapy for metastatic prostate cancer, specifically in combination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone for patients with loss of PTEN in >/=90% of tumor cells on immunohistochemistry staining. Adverse events were common, including hyperglycaemia, diarrhoea and grade 3 rash. Whilst the efficacy in the full trial cohort was modest, post hoc analyses identified significant efficacy in tumors with complete PTEN loss ( approximately 5% of all tumors). Given an increasing number of treatment options for metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer, future work could evaluate capivasertib for tumors with greatest sensitivity and in combination with docetaxel, radioligand therapeutics and radiotherapy."

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM), a WHO grade IV astrocytoma, is the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer in adults and represents approximately half of all malignant brain tumors across different age groups. Modern treatment approaches, including surgical removal, combined radiochemotherapy, and follow-up chemotherapy, have yet to significantly improve patient prognosis. Patients typically survive only 15 months, with most experiencing quick tumor recurrence and less than 7% surviving beyond five years. Early GBM detection faces significant obstacles due to the vague initial symptoms and constraints of existing diagnostic tools, such as magnetic resonance imaging and invasive tissue sampling. These limitations often result in late-stage diagnosis, reducing treatment effectiveness. While liquid biopsy has emerged as a less invasive alternative allowing repeated sampling and ongoing monitoring, the low concentration of biomarkers in blood presents a significant challenge. Microfluidic technologies offer a revolutionary approach to GBM diagnosis. These biosensors enable precise microscale fluid handling and significantly increase the detection, concentration, and real-time analysis of circulating GBM biomarkers, including exosomes, nucleic acids, and proteins. This technology reduces sample volume requirements and allows quick, sequential disease monitoring, making early detection and personalized patient care more achievable. This review examines cutting-edge developments in microfluidic biosensor technology for brain tumor diagnosis, with a particular focus on GBM. By combining molecular analysis, miniaturized engineering, and liquid biopsy techniques, microfluidic biosensors have become crucial in neuro-oncology diagnostics. This review evaluates current capabilities, addresses technical challenges, and explores future possibilities for implementing microfluidic platforms in clinical settings to improve early intervention and treatment outcomes for patients with malignant brain tumors."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk of vulvar dysplasia and malignancy in lichen sclerosus patients treated with topical clobetasol or topical calcineurin inhibitors. STUDY DESIGN: This population-level retrospective cohort study used TriNetX, a research database of electronic health records and claims data from United States and European patients. We assessed 55,696 adult lichen sclerosus patients and matched controls to evaluate baseline risk. To analyze treatment effects, 14,430 clobetasol-exposed lichen sclerosus patients were compared with matched corticosteroid-naive controls. 6,227 topical calcineurin inhibitor-exposed patients were similarly matched and compared to unexposed controls. Lastly, 7,239 clobetasol-exposed patients were directly compared to matched topical calcineurin inhibitor-exposed patients. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated to quantify the risk of developing the outcome, and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses with log-rank tests were used to estimate the cumulative probability of outcome occurrence over a defined time interval. Statistical significance was defined as a P-value <0.05 for all analyses. RESULTS: Over 10 years, lichen sclerosus was associated with an 11-fold increased risk of vulvar malignancy (RR, 11.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.92-13.76) and an 8-fold increased risk of vulvar dysplasia (RR, 8.04; 95% CI, 6.47-9.98) compared to controls. Clobetasol was associated with a relative overall reduced risk of vulvar malignancy, with a statistically significant risk reduction observed at the 2-year time point (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42-0.94). Topical calcineurin inhibitor exposure was not associated with an increased risk of vulvar dysplasia or malignancy at any time point. There were no significant differences in the risk of dysplasia or malignancy between patients treated with clobetasol versus topical calcineurin inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Lichen sclerosus is associated with a significantly increased risk of vulvar dysplasia and malignancy. In this study, clobetasol appeared to be protective against neoplastic transformation, particularly in early stages of the disease. Topical calcineurin inhibitors were not associated with an increased risk of dysplasia or malignancy."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancers that invade the cervical stroma are generally associated with worse clinical outcomes than tumors confined to the uterine corpus. However, tumors that spread to the cervical stroma often present other adverse prognostic features, making it uncertain whether cervical stromal invasion independently influences prognosis. Previous studies have provided limited and inconsistent results. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the independent prognostic significance of cervical stromal invasion in patients with early-stage endometrial cancer. STUDY DESIGN: This multicenter retrospective study included patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics 2009 stage I-II endometrial cancer who underwent surgical staging at nine regional medical institutions across China between 2000 and 2019. The primary outcome was progression-free survival, and the secondary outcome was overall survival. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association of cervical stromal invasion with survival outcomes. Propensity score matching was applied to balance baseline characteristics between patients with and without cervical stromal invasion. Variables used for propensity score were age at diagnosis, hypertension, diabetes, carbohydrate antigen 125 level, histological type, depth of myometrial invasion, lymphovascular space invasion, peritoneal cytology, surgical approach, type of hysterectomy, lymphadenectomy, and adjuvant therapy. To assess the robustness of the findings, subgroup analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 7,383 patients were included (524 with cervical stromal invasion and 6,859 without cervical stromal invasion). Cervical stromal invasion was not independently associated with decreased progression-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.94-1.81; P=.106) and overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-2.00; P=.171) at multivariable analysis performed on the entire cohort. In the propensity score-matched cohort, patients with and without cervical stromal invasion showed similar 5-year progression-free survival and overall survival (92.3% vs 93.7%, P=.493; 95.0% vs 95.7%, P=.791). Subgroup analyses by histological type and adjuvant therapy also showed no significant differences in survival outcomes between patients with and without cervical stromal invasion. CONCLUSION: After adjusting for confounders, the presence of cervical stromal invasion does not affect progression-free survival or overall survival in women with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics 2009 stage I-II endometrial cancer."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a high risk of early recurrence after surgery. We evaluated the utility of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) taken at different time points as a prognostic tool. Secondary aims were prognostic value of ctDNA combined with plasma carbohydrate antigen (CA)-19-9 and of peritoneal tumour DNA (ptDNA). METHODS: A total of 75 patients were included. Plasma samples were obtained preoperatively, 1 month, and 7-9 months after resection. Peritoneal lavage fluid (PLF) was collected preoperatively and 7-9 months after resection. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from plasma and ptDNA was analysed using mutation specific digital droplet PCR assays in a tumour-informed apprach. Kaplan-Meier survival curves, univariable, and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: Preoperatively, detectable ctDNA was an independent risk factor for OS (HR=1.88, p=0.047). Detectable ctDNA 7-9 months after surgerywas an independent risk factor for RFS (HR=4.48, p=0.017). Detectable ctDNA 1 month after surgery showed decreased RFS (HR=1.98, p=0.055). Preoperative, 1-month, and 7-9 months postoperative positivity for ctDNA and/or CA 19-9 showed a significantly worse median OS (p=0.024, p=0.008, and p=0.0003). We did not find association of ptDNA with OS or RFS, but ptDNA detection 7-9 months after surgery was associated with peritoneal RFS (p=0.003). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that detectable ctDNA in plasma taken before and 7-9 months after surgery holds independent prognostic value in surgically treated PDAC. Combination of ctDNA with CA-19-9 may be a particularly strong prognosticator, which should be confirmed in future studies."

    "abstract": "Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are key therapeutic targets in oncology, and hydroxamic acid derivatives represent one of the most effective inhibitor classes. To explore the structure-activity relationships of this scaffold, a series of 2-mercaptoquinazoline-based hydroxamic acid derivatives (4a-e, 7a-i, and 10a-e) were synthesized and evaluated for HDAC inhibition and anticancer activity, with SAHA serving as a positive control. The 4a-e series emerged as the most potent HDAC inhibitors, with IC(50) values of 0.33-0.87 muM, led by 4a (0.33 +/- 0.02 muM), though weaker than SAHA (0.06 +/- 0.01 muM). Cytotoxicity assays across colorectal (SW620, HCT116), breast (MDA-MB-231), prostate (PC-3), and lung (A549) cancer cell lines demonstrated that 4b (6-CH(3)) and 4c (7-CH(3)) were the most effective, achieving IC(50) values of 0.93-1.34 muM in HCT116 and 1.79-2.08 muM in SW620. In the 7a-i series, compounds 7b (6-CH(3)), 7d (6-Cl), and particularly 7f (7-F) demonstrated notable cytotoxicity with IC(50) values of 1.14-3.64 muM across SW620, HCT116, and MDA-MB-231 cells, comparable to the most active derivatives in the 4-series; conversely, bulky halogen substituents (7g, 7i) or the unsubstituted analog 7a led to markedly reduced activity (> 4.5 muM). The 10a-e series was significantly less active, and 10e (7-F) showed undesirable toxicity toward normal MRC-5 fibroblasts (IC(50) = 0.72 +/- 0.02 muM). Mechanistic studies further confirmed that 4c and 7f induced G(2)/M arrest and apoptosis in SW620 cells. Collectively, these findings highlight 4a-c and 7f as promising lead compounds, combining submicromolar HDAC inhibition, potent antiproliferative effects, and acceptable selectivity, providing a strong foundation for further development of quinazoline-based HDAC inhibitors. Molecular docking studies supported these results by revealing favorable interactions of the hydroxamate zinc-binding group and the 2-mercaptoquinazoline scaffold within the HDAC active site, consistent with the observed structure-activity relationship (SAR) trends."

    "abstract": "Histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) is a key member of the class IIa HDAC subfamily (HDAC4, 5, 7, and 9) that is characterized by a key tyrosine-to-histidine substitution in its active site, a feature that renders these HDACs catalytically inefficient and underscores their versatile roles beyond intrinsic deacetylation. Structurally, HDAC7 is distinguished from its paralogs by its lack of the conserved N-terminal glutamine-rich domain. This combination of functional duality and a unique structural context enables HDAC7 to regulate a vast array of cellular processes. Consequently, its dysregulation is implicated in numerous pathologies, including cancer and autoimmune disorders, establishing it as a compelling therapeutic target. However, effectively and selectively targeting HDAC7 is complicated by its context-dependent biological modes of actions and the high structural homology it shares with other class IIa isoforms. This review first provides a current overview of the multifaceted roles of HDAC7 in human diseases and discusses how its contributions are dictated by the complex interplay between its catalytic and diverse scaffolding functions. We then summarize the recent medicinal chemistry efforts, from the class-selective deacetylase inhibitors to the recently emerged targeted protein degraders that not only achieve superior isoform selectivity but also modulate HDAC7's deacetylase-independent functions. By bridging the functional complexity of HDAC7 with the latest advances in chemical biology tools, we aim to provide a timely summary of the current status of HDAC7 as a druggable target and offer a perspective on strategies guiding the development of next-generation modulators."

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide, with a rising burden projected over the coming decades. While traditional risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia form the foundation of prevention strategies, many individuals carry a \"residual\" risk secondary to systemic inflammation which remains underrecognized. Landmark trials have established inflammation as a causal and modifiable driver of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). This review focuses on how inflammation can modulate interconnected diseases of the brain and heart. Growing evidence suggests inflammation mediates a \"brain-heart\" axis, linking psychological stress, neuroinflammation, and cardiovascular pathology. Observational and mechanistic studies demonstrate that stress-induced neural activity, particularly within the amygdala, is associated with hematopoietic activation, arterial inflammation, and increased cardiovascular events. Models such as Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy and stroke-heart syndrome illustrate how acute brain injury can precipitate cardiovascular dysfunction via autonomic and inflammatory pathways. More recently, molecular imaging studies have provided direct evidence of stress-associated amygdalar activity being associated with both cardiovascular outcomes and cancer prognosis. This emerging framework reframes the brain and heart as interdependent organs connected through inflammatory and neurobiological processes. It highlights the potential for novel therapeutic targets, including modulation of stress-related neural pathways, alongside established anti-inflammatory strategies. Future directions include refinement of targeted therapies, use of advanced molecular imaging, and mechanistic studies to better delineate the pathways linking stress, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease."

    "abstract": "Photosensitizers (PSs) that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) under light irradiation are pivotal for biomedical applications owing to precise spatiotemporal control, negligible drug resistance, and minimal side effects. Yet conventional PSs often suffer from complex synthesis, low ROS quantum yields, and aggregation-induced ROS quenching. Coordination-driven self-assembly offers an efficient strategy to address these issues by combining metal acceptors with photosensitizing ligands to yield discrete, tunable supramolecular architectures. Heavy-atom effects from metal centers enhance intersystem crossing and ROS generation, while rigid, charged frameworks mitigate aggregation-caused ROS quenching and improve cellular or bacterial uptake. Incorporation of long-wavelength ligands further increases therapeutic penetration. These features enable broad applications in bioimaging, photodynamic therapy (PDT), chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and multimodal treatments. This review summarizes recent advances in the rational design of supramolecular PSs, covering fundamental principles, representative synthetic strategies, and state-of-the-art anticancer and antibacterial applications, including chemo-photodynamic combination therapy, photothermal-photodynamic dual therapy, and photoactivated immunotherapy. Remaining challenges and future opportunities are highlighted to guide the development of next-generation supramolecular PSs for clinical translation. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Supramolecular photosensitizers (PSs) assembled via coordination-driven strategies offer a promising platform for light-mediated biomedical therapies. By integrating metal centers and photosensitizing ligands, these systems enhance ROS generation, suppress aggregation-caused quenching, and enable tunable architectures with improved biological performance.

    "abstract": "Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a unique form of apoptosis that enables immunocompetent hosts to elicit specific immune responses against antigens associated with dying cells. Pyroptosis, a recently identified lytic programmed cell death pathway, can be utilized to achieve ICD. However, most pyroptosis inducers are inflammatory small molecules or chemical activators, which are often limited by drug resistance and systemic toxicity. Here, we present a photosensitive calcium-based nanoinducer (CaNMs@SP) that modulates intracellular calcium levels to enhance ICD effectiveness, providing a strategy to improve cancer immunotherapy by directly regulating calcium signaling. Under 750 nm light irradiation, CaNMs@SP can promote the influx of exogenous calcium ions into tumor cells through photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT), while the calcium ions carried by the nanomaterials diffuse within the tumor cells, resulting in an accumulation of calcium ions inside the tumor cells. This induces calcium ions overload, causing tumor cell swelling, membrane rupture, leading to ICD and the emission of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), thereby activating the anti-tumor immunity. In vitro studies confirm the upregulation of Caspase-3 and GSDME that induce tumour swelling and cell death induction. In vivo experiments show tumor ablation, T cell activation, and tumor recurrence inhibition, highlighting the potential of CaNMs@SP as a personalized immunotherapy through pyroptosis-dependent ICD. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We developed a photosensitive calcium-based nanoinducer (CaNMs@SP) that triggers calcium overload to induce pyroptosis-dependent immunogenic cell death (ICD). Unlike conventional small-molecule inducers, this platform avoids drug resistance and systemic toxicity by integrating photothermal/photodynamic therapy with calcium ion modulation. Demonstrating effective tumor ablation, T cell activation, and recurrence inhibition, CaNMs@SP offers a promising strategy for personalized cancer immunotherapy."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Although cancer is associated with elevated rates of suicidal ideation, not all individuals affected by this disease are equally vulnerable. This heterogeneity suggests other, including psychological factors may play a critical role in shaping risk. However, research has rarely examined suicidal ideation in cancer patients through the lens of established suicide theories. This study addresses this gap by investigating theory-derived psychological risk and protective factors, which are derived from the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (IPTS), the Integrated Motivational-Volitional Model of Suicidal Behavior (IMV) and cancer-specific suicide theories. METHODS: In total, 618 cancer patients from various settings completed questionnaires assessing sociodemographic and cancer-associated characteristics as well as perceived burdensomeness/thwarted belongingness (IPTS), defeat/entrapment (IMV), primary and secondary control. Multiple network analyses were conducted, exploring the structure and interplay of these factors and their relation to suicidal ideation - independently for each theory as well as a combined overall network. RESULTS: Suicidal ideation was reported by 11.74 % of participants. All core risk factors of the IPTS and IMV were (indirectly) associated with suicidal ideation, with perceived burdensomeness being the only variable with a direct link. Perceived burdensomeness also accounted for most of suicidal ideation's variance (44.63 %; 95 %CI: 17.87, 68.57). Primary and secondary control acted as protective factors. CONCLUSION: Perceived burdensomeness forms the bridge between the psychological burden of cancer and suicidal ideation and should therefore be assessed in routine screenings and targeted in psychosocial interventions. Secondary control strategies hold great potential to buffer against adverse emotional states and dysfunctional cognitive biases."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients diagnosed with oral cavity SCC between 2010 and 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Immunohistochemical staining for TLR-3, TLR-4, and TLR-9 was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. Expression was assessed based on staining intensity, staining status and percentage of positive tumor cells (prevalence). Associations with tumor stage (T, N, TNM), depth of invasion (DOI), lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PNI), extranodal extension (ENE), histological grade, recurrence, and survival status were evaluated statistically. RESULTS: No statistically significant correlations were found between TLR-3, TLR-4, or TLR-9 expression and any of the examined clinicopathological features (p> 0.05). Although an increasing trend in DOI was observed with stronger TLR-3 and TLR-4 staining, the results were not statistically significant. DISCUSSION: This study did not establish a clear prognostic role for TLR-3, TLR-4, or TLR-9 in oral cavity SCC. However, the findings highlight the biological complexity of TLR-mediated pathways in cancer. Further large-scale, multi-institutional studies are necessary to better understand the clinical relevance of TLRs in oral carcinogenesis."

This study aims to investigate the feasibility of the Tai Chi modification of the submental flap in the repair of tongue cancer-related defects. METHODS: This project was designed as a retrospective cohort study. Clinical data of patients who underwent contralateral Tai Chi modification of the submental flap repair after tongue cancer resection at our institution from April 2024 to April 2025 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 4 patients (3 males and 1 female). No significant postoperative flap necrosis was seen, with only 1 case of tip bruising. In terms of tension in the donor area, the patients self-reported no significant tension in the neck, and no incision cracking was seen after suture removal on the 7th postoperative day. The patient's tongue function recovered well after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The submental island Tai Chi modification of the submental flap reconstructs tongue cancer defects with good postoperative functional recovery. And with low neck tension, the neck suture can be removed earlier."

METHODS: We studied biopsy-naive men who underwent PHI testing followed by prostate biopsy after a screening PSA of 10-20 ng/mL. We performed logistic regression analysis to determine associations between clinicopathologic characteristics and the outcome of interest, which was the presence of grade group (GG) >/=2 at biopsy. We examined the combined effect of PHI with MRI findings in cancer detection. RESULTS: There were 456 patients, of whom 304 (66.7%) had cancer at biopsy. The median PHI of patients with GG >/=2 was significantly higher than those without cancer (76.3 vs. 44.2, P<0.001). Patients with PHI >/=55.0 demonstrated an 8.9 times (P=0.001) increased odds of GG >/=2 disease than patients with PHI 0-26.9. Higher PI-RADS scores on MRI were associated with a significant increase in cancer detection. Cancer was diagnosed in zero patients with PHI <36 and PI-RADS 1-2 and in 1 of 22 patients (4.5%) with PHI <36 and PI-RADS 1-3. CONCLUSIONS: PHI was associated with the detection of cancer among biopsy-naive men with a screening PSA of 10-20 ng/mL.

TABULATION, INTEGRATION AND RESULTS: Most international guidelines support the use of a risk assessment model (RAM), such as the Caprini score. There is broad consensus on the use of pharmacologic and mechanical prophylaxis for moderate- to high-risk patients and for extended prophylaxis in cancer-related surgeries. However, guidelines inconsistently address other aspects of VTE prophylaxis such as, timing of pre- and postoperative prophylaxis, use in minimally invasive surgery, and management of same-day discharge cases. CONCLUSIONS: Establishing consistent international guidelines for VTE prophylaxis is essential to help providers worldwide prevent a potentially fatal complication following gynecologic surgery. Further research is needed to standardize best practices and support their incorporation into guidelines."

    "abstract": "GISTs are predominantly characterized by mutations in KIT or PDGFRA. Mutation detection is important for optimal therapy. NGS panels are useful in GIST assessment as they allow for simultaneous evaluation of multiple genes. However, inherent to use of NGS with short read sequences on formalin-fixed specimens is the potential to miss larger indel variants. Over nine years, GIST testing was performed on specimens from 55 patients by amplicon-based, semi-conductor NGS using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 (CHPv2), a CHPv2-based GIST panel, or the Oncomine Precision Assay. Negative cases were evaluated by dideoxy sequencing for detection of mutations in KIT and PDGFRA, as per our clinical protocol. Prior to reflexive sequencing, out of 55 completed analyses, 47 (85%) were positive for KIT or PDGFRA mutations by NGS. Three cases were attributed to positivity for pathogenic variants in other genes. Of the 5 cases evaluated by dideoxy sequencing, all five (9% of all specimens) were positive for pathogenic or likely pathogenic KIT mutations. 12% of KIT mutations required dideoxy sequencing for identification. Mutations were 12 to 39 nucleotide deletion or duplication variants. Our results suggest that short read, amplicon-based NGS assays may miss a significant number of clinically actionable KIT mutations and that follow-up of KIT and PDGFRA NGS-negative cases by alternative testing modalities should be considered."

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) arising on a background of fibrosis has fundamental mechanistic and clinical differences compared to HCC that arises in a non-fibrotic liver. The fibrotic microenvironment is characterized by extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, dynamic interactions with immune and stromal cells, and activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Recent multi-omics analyses have demonstrated that these fibrotic niches dynamically promote hepatocarcinogenesis, metastasis and immune evasion. Several therapeutic strategies targeting fibrosis have improved HCC outcomes in clinical trials. These advances have facilitated an understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying fibrosis-driven HCC and are helping to optimize therapeutic prescriptions. This review synthesizes recent advances in understanding the role of fibrosis in hepatocarcinogenesis, aggressiveness, and metastasis; decodes how stromal-immune crosstalk defines immune escape through the fibrosis-driven '3C' immune evasion framework; and links mechanistic insights into fibrosis-driven HCC with emerging theranostic strategies. We emphasize that targeting fibrosis-driven oncogenic mechanisms may enhance the therapeutic efficacy in HCC, thus providing a scientific foundation for rationalizing this approach as a viable strategy against both liver fibrosis and HCC."

    "abstract": "Fatty acids (FAs) are indispensable for cellular homeostasis and centered in anabolic and catabolic pathways that are tightly governed by long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSLs). These enzymes drive fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO) to generate energy, remodel cell membrane phospholipid composition to dictate ferroptosis susceptibility, coordinate steroidogenesis and eicosanoid biosynthesis, and mediate metabolic reprogramming, thus acting as a central nexus between FAs metabolism and cell death. Dysregulation of ACSLs across malignancies fosters oncogenic dependency on metabolic reprogramming, influencing tumor progression, immune modulation, and therapy resistance, offering a rationale for anticancer therapeutic opportunities. Here, we delineate the decisive roles of ACSLs in the metabolic fate of FAs and cell death execution. We dissect their tumorigenic mechanisms through metabolic rewiring and cell death modulation, with an emphasis on ACSLs-mediated crosstalk between ferroptosis and cancer immunity. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of ACSLs-targeted agents in tumor therapy and the treatment of ferroptosis-associated pathologies, offering actionable insights for clinical translation."

However, patients treated by ICIs are in jeopardy for immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that attack any organ including the heart. ICIs-induced myocarditis (ICIIM) is an uncommon but possibly fatal irAE. With the increasing use of ICIs and improved diagnosis of this disease, the incidence of ICIIM is growing rapidly. In this review, we briefly overview roles of T cells and their immune checkpoints, and categorize the pathogenic process of ICIIM into three stages (upstream, midstream and downstream), with addressing recent research progress on the pathogenic mechanisms in each stage, particularly focusing on the downstream core pathogenic components and potential therapeutics for this disease."

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) being the predominant subtype. Despite the availability of traditional treatments such as radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery, as well as emerging immunotherapies, the five-year survival rate and prognosis remain suboptimal. Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) are the most abundant immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of lung cancer, and understanding their role in cancer therapy is highly important. This review comprehensively discusses the dual role of TANs in lung cancer progression. First, we examined the recruitment, classification, and single-cell heterogeneity of TANs, highlighting the distinct molecular expression and functions across subpopulations. Mechanistically, TANs influence tumor behavior through direct cellcell interactions and cytokine production. Additionally, neutrophils engage with other cells in the TME via metabolic reprogramming, programmed cell death, epigenetic modifications, and vesicle secretion. To date, no studies have systematically summarized and connected these mechanisms. Finally, we summarize the clinical applications and prospects of TANs in lung cancer, including their potential role in assisting in diagnosis, predicting prognosis, and targeting neutrophils to increase the efficacy of radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. We hope that this review provides insights for future research aimed at improving lung cancer prognosis through the targeting of TANs."

Therapeutic advancements in the field enhanced clinical outcomes and overall prognostic improvement. Beyond the molecular profile, disease burden serves as a predictive marker for treatment response and overall prognostic outcomes. The current disease staging categorizes patients based on the number and sites of metastatic involvement. In this context, the addition of local ablative therapies (LAT) is candidate to enhance or prolong the effectiveness of standard systemic therapies. Our systematic review aims to summarize current evidence dealing with the outcomes of LAT in the context of oncogene addicted NSCLC.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with increased health risks, including cancer, but their impact on cancer screening behaviors remains inconsistently documented. This study examines associations between ACEs and guideline-recommended breast, prostate, cervical and colorectal cancer screening behaviors using data from 28 U.S. states. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of 134,174 respondents from the 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) was conducted, representing 80.1 million adults. Cancer screening adherence was assessed according to U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze associations between ACE exposure (0, 1, 2, 3, or >/=4 ACEs) and screening adherence, adjusting for sociodemographic and healthcare access factors. RESULTS: Women with two ACEs (aPR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.91-1.00) or >/=4 ACEs (aPR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.98) were significantly less likely to adhere to breast cancer screening guidelines. Men with one ACE (aPR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81-0.96), two ACEs (aPR 0.86, 95% CI: 0.77-0.94), and three ACEs (aPR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.78-0.98) had lower rates of prostate cancer screening adherence. No significant associations were found between ACEs and cervical or colorectal cancer screening. Insurance coverage and having a personal doctor were the strongest independent predictors of screening adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to ACEs is associated with reduced adherence to breast and prostate cancer screening, potentially compounding cancer risks in individuals with ACE exposure. These findings highlight the importance of addressing barriers to cancer screening among individuals with histories of childhood adversity."

This study aimed to investigate the consistency between the Asian Working Group for Cachexia (AWGC) and Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria and their associations with overall survival (OS) in palliative care settings. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with advanced cancer referred to the palliative care team at Aichi Medical University Hospital between April 2019 and March 2024. Cachexia and malnutrition were diagnosed according to the AWGC and GLIM frameworks, incorporating both phenotypic and etiologic components. Patients were categorized into four groups based on diagnosis status: Group A (both cachexia and malnutrition), Group B (cachexia only), Group C (malnutrition only), and Group D (neither condition). OS was compared across groups using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for clinical covariates. RESULTS: Among 1,325 eligible patients, cachexia and malnutrition were diagnosed in 76% and 71%, respectively, with a 65% diagnostic overlap. Group A demonstrated the shortest median survival time (MST) at 74 days compared to 431 days in Group D (p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, only Group A diagnosis independently predicted poorer OS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.33, p < 0.001). Survival differences among Groups B, C, and D became evident only after excluding patients with edema (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Complementary application of the AWGC and GLIM criteria enhances prognostic stratification in patients with advanced cancer. Careful evaluation of fluid status is essential to optimize nutritional assessment and outcome prediction in this population."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Severe intraoperative hypotension is frequently reported during transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) using orally administered 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (5-ALA); however, the influence of anesthetic technique on prolonged hypotensive episodes remains unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 423 consecutive patients who underwent oral 5-ALA-guided TURBT between 2018 and 2024. Sustained hypotension was defined as mean arterial pressure <65 mmHg lasting >/=30 min. Baseline characteristics, anesthetic variables, and hemodynamic parameters were compared between patients with and without sustained hypotension. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors. RESULTS: Among patients receiving general anesthesia (n=274), the incidence of sustained hypotension varied significantly depending on the anesthetic agent (p=0.02). In multivariable logistic regression, remimazolam was independently associated with a significantly lower risk of sustained hypotension compared with sevoflurane (adjusted OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.14-0.83, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-fourth of patients undergoing oral 5-ALA-guided TURBT experienced sustained intraoperative hypotension, with spinal anesthesia showing a lower incidence than general anesthesia. Longer anesthesia and surgical durations increased the risk. The choice of anesthetic agents under general anesthesia also appeared to affect the risk of sustained hypotension. These findings highlight the importance of individualized anesthetic management to maintain hemodynamic stability during this procedure."

    "abstract": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a pivotal role in cancer progression, and their polarization toward the M2 phenotype contributes to immune suppression and metastasis promotion. One promising immunotherapeutic approach involves reprogramming M2 macrophages into the pro-inflammatory and anti-tumor M1 phenotype within the tumor microenvironment. This study investigated the effect of exosomes derived from 4T1 breast cancer cells, loaded with microRNA let-7a, on macrophage polarization and tumor-related behaviors. Tumor-derived exosomes (TEXs) were isolated and characterized by DLS, Flowcytometry (CD63) and TEM, followed by let-7a loading via electroporation. Peritoneal macrophages from Balb/c mice were extracted, polarized into the immunosuppressive M2 phenotype, and subsequently treated with let-7a -enriched exosomes (TEX+ let-7a), leading to their repolarization into M1 macrophages. Anti-cancer assays, including viability, apoptosis, metastasis, angiogenesis, and migration, were then performed. Results demonstrated that these engineered exosomes effectively repolarized M2 macrophages into active, tumor-suppressing M1 macrophages. The induced M1 macrophages significantly reduced cancer cell survival, increased apoptosis through elevated BAX/Bcl-2 ratio, and suppressed the expression of metastasis-associated (MMP2, MMP9) and angiogenesis-related (VEGF) genes. Moreover, cancer cell migration was markedly inhibited. Collectively, these findings indicate that let-7a -enriched exosomes can reprogram macrophage plasticity to effectively suppress malignant behaviors in breast cancer. This novel approach highlights the high therapeutic potential of targeted exosome-based miRNA delivery for refining tumor microenvironment regulation and advancing breast cancer immunotherapy strategies."

    "abstract": "Microplastics and nanoplastics (MNPs) are emerging pollutants widely dispersed in the environment, with humans primarily exposed through ingestion and inhalation. Although their biological effects are being increasingly studied, their potential effect on human health and disease risk remains uncertain. This Review summarises evidence on potential disease risks of human exposure to MNPs, while highlighting key limitations and research gaps. Evidence suggests that MNP exposure might elevate the risk of various diseases, including metabolic, respiratory, cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, hepatic, renal, and skin disorders, as well as infectious diseases, cancer, and ageing-related disorders. Despite extensive evidence of adverse effects in animal models and cell cultures, direct evidence linking MNP exposure to human disease risk remains scarce. A key challenge on research of MNPs lies in the scarcity of robust human exposure data and the narrow scope of existing studies on specific types of MNPs, leaving several environmentally prevalent plastic particles understudied. Addressing these gaps will require investigating the mechanisms of toxicity, relevant biomarkers, and disease pathways associated with MNP exposure. Such efforts will be essential to clarify human health risks and inform future regulatory and mitigation strategies."

    "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapies benefit only a subset of patients, highlighting the need to define tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of immune evasion. Using a kinome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we identify MAP3K7 (transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 [TAK1]) as a checkpoint that protects cancer cells from CD8(+) T cell-mediated killing. TAK1 integrates tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon gamma (IFNgamma) signals to drive a cytoprotective response that blocks cytokine-induced death and prevents bystander killing by perforin-deficient T cells. Inhibition of TAK1 redirects TNF/IFNgamma signaling toward apoptosis via RIPK1 and caspase-8 while simultaneously amplifying IFNgamma outputs to further prime cells for cytokine-driven death. Mechanistically, TAK1 loss triggers proteasomal degradation of cFLIP, promoting complex II formation and undermining protective pathways. In immune-competent mice, TAK1 deficiency markedly impairs tumor growth, whereas immune-deficient hosts show little effect. Adoptive T cell therapy preferentially eliminates TAK1-deficient clones. These findings establish TAK1 as a tumor-intrinsic immune checkpoint and support TAK1 inhibition as a strategy to enhance cancer immunotherapy."

Here, we isolate 183 Bacteroides isolates from the feces of humanized anti-PD-1 responder mice. Supernatants from 6 of 183 isolates stimulate IFNgamma production from primary CD8(+) T cells. These six isolates (6-consort) enhance anti-PD-1-induced anti-tumor efficacy in syngeneic and orthotopic lung cancer models compared to non-responder feces-colonized mice, an effect dependent on the production of IFNgamma. Bioassay-guided fractionation and comparative metabolomics lead to the discovery of an active N-acyl amide (cis-Bac429) produced by Bacteroides. cis-Bac429 stimulates IFNgamma production by CD8(+) T cells but not synthetic saturated Bac429 (sat-Bac429), indicating structural specificity. Intratumorally administered cis-Bac429, but not sat-Bac429, significantly decreases subcutaneous lung and colon tumor growth in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy and drives IFNgamma+ CD8(+) T cell tumor infiltration. These findings pave the way for development of Bacteroides-type N-acyl-amides as adjuvant treatments for anti-PD-1-refractory NSCLC."

    "abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was among the first receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) shown to be activated by ligand-induced dimerization. Structural studies explain how ligand binding induces the dimerization of EGFR's extracellular region. Unlike other RTKs, EGFR's intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) is activated allosterically in an asymmetric dimer that is observed crystallographically, but not in cryo-EM studies of intact EGFR. Here, we show that this asymmetric TKD dimer forms only transiently - explaining its lack of definition by cryo-EM. By engineering an asymmetric TKD dimer and studying a TKD-duplicated lung cancer EGFR variant, we show that TKD dimerization increases kinase activity by several hundred-fold. We were also able to stabilize and visualize discrete asymmetric EGFR TKD dimers at high resolution using cryo-EM. Our findings argue that oncogenic mutations activate EGFR primarily by promoting TKD dimerization, and suggest that the transient nature of EGFR TKD dimers may allow biased EGFR signaling."

Here, we examined the localization of CCR7(+) DCs within tumors and the impact of this positioning on antitumor immunity. Spatial, single-cell, and intravital analyses of human cancers and mouse models reveal that CCR7(+) DCs form perivascular clusters. Fibroblasts surrounding venous blood vessels produced CCL19, guiding CCR7(+) DCs into perivascular niches. Regulatory T (Treg) cells frequently contact perivascular CCR7(+) DCs, suppressing CD40 expression and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell activation. Treg cell depletion restored CD40 expression by CCR7(+) DCs, enhanced immunostimulatory programs, and improved T cell-dependent tumor control. Anti-PD-1 not only increased perivascular CCR7(+) DC clustering and IL-12 production but also strengthened Treg-DC interactions through a CCL22-dependent mechanism, limiting therapeutic efficacy. CCR7(+) DCs expressed both co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules, which may underlie their capacity for antitumor activation and concurrent vulnerability to suppression. Modulating the mechanisms that form and restrain CCR7(+) DC perivascular immune hubs may improve cancer immunotherapy."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Living in an urban environment exposes the population to a mix of environmental and social factors, known as the Urban Exposome, that can influence health via changes in DNA methylation. We hypothesised that linking urban exposures with epigenome-wide DNA methylation in blood can reveal impacts across the lifespan. METHODS: In the EXPANSE project, we conducted an inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies of seven European cohorts. Urban exposures were estimated at participants' home addresses and included air pollution (PM2.5, NO(2), O(3)), light at night, modified soil-adjusted vegetation index, and urbanicity. FINDINGS: DNA methylation was measured in blood samples from 1778 children (4-10 years), 878 adolescents (16 years), and 5975 adults (18-87 years). PM2.5, NO(2), and greenness were associated with methylation differences in children, while greenness and urbanicity showed associations in adults. Regional analyses showed differentially methylated regions (DMRs) across all life stages. Pathway analysis showed that monthly NO(2) in children was linked to immune and infectious disease pathways, whereas adult urbanicity was associated with immune pathways as well as PD-L1 expression and the PD-1 checkpoint pathway in cancer. INTERPRETATION: Urban environmental factors induce DNA methylation changes across life stages, with stronger associations in young children and adults. We observed a distinct contrast in the methylation changes associated with greenness compared to other urban environmental factors. However, disentangling exposure-specific methylome signatures remains a challenge.

Proteins involved in maintaining genomic stability, such as ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) and topoisomerase 1, are promising therapeutic targets in SCLC. Berzosertib, a highly potent, selective, intravenously administered ATR inhibitor, has demonstrated promising antitumor activity in patients with platinum-resistant SCLC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This phase II, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study (NCT04768296) included patients with relapsed platinum-resistant SCLC who received berzosertib (210 mg/m(2) on days 2, 5) and topotecan (1.25 mg/m(2) on days 1-5) intravenously in 21-day cycles until disease progression. Primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR per RECIST v1.1), assessed by an Independent Review Committee. Key secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS: A preplanned interim analysis for futility after the first 40 patients had completed their second on-treatment tumor assessment (or dropped out/died prematurely) revealed a low probability of reaching the predefined efficacy threshold, leading to premature study termination. At the final analysis (n = 73), four patients achieved confirmed partial response, resulting in an ORR of 5.5%. The median PFS was 2.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-2.7 months], and the median OS was 6.4 months (95% CI 4.2-7.6 months). No new safety concerns were observed, with the safety profile of berzosertib and topotecan combination therapy being consistent with the known risk profile of the respective monotherapies. CONCLUSIONS: No added clinical benefit of berzosertib and topotecan combination was observed over topotecan monotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant SCLC."

Polysaccharides derived from Acanthopanax senticosus (ASPS) are natural polysaccharides extracted from the dried roots, rhizomes, or stems of Araliaceae family plant. Selenium (Se), a crucial trace element for immune system functioning, is often incorporated into polysaccharides to enhance their immunomodulatory effects. PURPOSE: This study sought to elucidate the immunomodulatory and antitumor mechanisms of a newly developed selenium-modified polysaccharide (ASPS-e1-Se). Unlike previously reported unmodified polysaccharides, ASPS-e1-Se was designed with the incorporation of characteristic Se bonds (O-Se-C, Se-O-C, O-Se-O, Se=O), which endowed it with unique structural features enabling interaction with intestinal flora, regulation of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthesis, and reinforcement of host immune responses against tumors. STUDY DESIGN: The structural characteristics of ASPS-e1 were analyzed using UV and FT-IR spectroscopy, its molecular weight analyzed by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), monosaccharide composition evaluated via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and selenium content quantified using fluorescence spectrophotometry. The structure of ASPS-e1-Se was further characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy. A mouse S180 sarcoma model was applied to assess the immunomodulatory and antitumor effects of ASPS-e1-Se, assessing tumor inhibition rates, thymus and spleen indices, histopathological changes, and serum cytokines IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-10. Splenic tissue underwent mRNA-seq analysis with RT-qPCR validation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), while intestinal content was analyzed through 16S rDNA sequencing and SCFA profiling. RESULTS: ASPS-e1, with a molecular weight of 1.920x10(4) (+/-2.080 %) g/mol, primarily comprises GalA, Ara, Gal, Xyl, Rha, Glc, GlcA, and Fuc in molar ratios of 3761:513:229:109:260:127:84:46. ASPS-e1-Se, containing 2.005 mg/g of Se, exhibited characteristic absorption peaks O-Se-C, Se-O-C, O-Se-O, and Se=O. ASPS-e1-Se effectively inhibited tumor growth and restored immune organ indices and their histopathological structures in the S180 mouse model. ASPS-e1-Se treatment increased pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) and decreased the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. It upregulated genes Tradd, Traf5, and IKKalpha while downregulating AK1, gadd45beta, SMAD2, SMAD3 and STAT3, influencing the NF-kappaB signaling pathway and initiating an immune response against tumor cells. Additionally, ASPS-e1-Se elevated the Firmicute/Bacteroidetes ratio, enhanced Lactobacillus proliferation, suppressed Alloprevotella growth, and boosted total SCFA production, particularly propionate and butyrate, while reducing acetate, thus stabilizing intestinal microbiota and improving antitumor immunity. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that ASPS-e1-Se, with its unique selenium-driven structural modification, exerts antitumor effects through coordinated regulation of cytokines, NF-kappaB-related gene expression, gut microbiota composition, and SCFA synthesis. This integrated mechanism highlights the novelty and innovative potential of ASPS-e1-Se compared with previously reported polysaccharides, underscoring its promise as a next-generation immunotherapeutic agent to overcome tumor-induced immunosuppression."

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most treatment-resistant malignancies, primarily attributed to its dense and fibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM), which impedes both immune cell infiltration and drug delivery. Despite the remarkable success of immunotherapy in other cancer types, its efficacy in PDAC has been significantly compromised by the immune-exclusion barrier. Recent advancements in nanomedicine offer a compelling strategy to overcome this hurdle through the development of ECM-responsive delivery systems. These platforms are engineered to respond to ECM-specific triggers such as hyaluronidase or matrix metalloproteinases, enabling localized degradation of the tumor stroma while simultaneously releasing immunostimulatory agents. This review summarizes the unique ECM biology of PDAC, current limitations of immunotherapy, and recent breakthroughs in stimuli-responsive nanotechnology. This study also comprehensively discusses design principles, preclinical validation outcomes, translational challenges, and emerging strategies integrating ECM modulation with next-generation immune activation. ECM-responsive nanomedicine represents a transformative paradigm in stroma-immune co-engineering and offers a promising avenue for unlocking immunotherapy in PDAC."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with nonmetastatic NPC treated at two tertiary referral cancer centers in China between January 2012 and December 2018. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the association between MRI-based RLN features and multiple survival endpoints. A simplified RLN risk scoring (RRS) system (incorporating RLN multiplicity, MID, adENE and CNN) was developed in SYSUCC cohort and validated in the GMUCH cohort. A new N classification system was proposed and compared with the 9th edition of AJCC N staging system using C-index. RESULTS: Positive RLNs were observed in 68.3 % of all patients, including 66.7 % (690/1035) in the SYSUCC cohort and 72.0 % (340/472) in the GMUCH cohort. High RRS (defined as RRS > 2) was independently associated with worse OS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.22; 95 % CI, 1.56-3.15, P < 0.001), PFS (HR, 2.45; 95 % CI, 1.87-3.20, P < 0.001), DMFS (HR, 2.71; 95 % CI, 1.88-3.91, P < 0.001), and RFS (HR, 2.20; 95 % CI, 1.51-3.20, P < 0.001). The proposed N classification system incorporated high RRS as a criterion for N3 disease, demonstrated higher C-index values compared with the 9th edition AJCC staging system for OS (0.666 vs 0.659), PFS (0.659 vs 0.639), DMFS (0.682 vs 0.663), and RFS (0.644 vs 0.629). CONCLUSIONS: High RRS was strongly correlated with inferior survival outcomes in NPC patients. Integrating high RRS into the current staging system by reclassifying these patients as N3 might improve prognostic stratification and offer more precise treatment guidance."

    "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a small but critical subset of tumor cells characterized by their inherent self-renewal ability, differentiation potential, and resistance to cancer therapies. Their capacity to reversibly transition between a stem-like and differentiated state, together with their ability to enter into quiescence, are key determinants of their contribution to tumor initiation, tumor progression, metastasis, and cancer recurrence. Among the various factors in the tumor microenvironment, increasing evidence suggests that interferons (IFNs) are key extrinsic modulators of CSC fate. Although type I (IFN-alpha/beta) and type II (IFN-gamma) IFNs have long been recognized for their antitumor properties, recent studies indicate that IFN-signaling may also facilitate CSC induction and maintenance. In this review, we summarize and critically assess our current understanding of the complex roles of IFNs in governing CSC survival, plasticity, and immunogenicity. We discuss how IFN-signaling thresholds, signaling duration, and intrinsic CSC regulatory networks determine whether IFNs suppress CSCs or instead reinforce stemness. By bridging mechanistic insights with therapeutic potential and clinical outcomes, we highlight emerging opportunities to exploit IFN pathways for improved biomarkers and therapeutic strategies to overcome CSC-driven resistance."

Self-care agency defined as an individual's capacity to initiate and maintain health-related behaviors is critical for optimizing well-being in cancer patients. While psychological factors, particularly personality traits, are known to influence self-care in chronic illnesses, their role in gynecological oncology remains underexplored. This study aimed to determine whether personality traits predict self-care agency among women with gynecological cancers. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional design was employed with 200 women recruited via convenience sampling. Data were collected using a demographic form, the Cervantes Personality Scale, and the Exercise of Self-Care Agency Scale. Simple linear regression analyses examined the predictive value of personality subscales on self-care agency. RESULTS: Personality traits were found to be significant predictors of self-care agency. Extroversion, emotional stability, and consistency explained 37.5 %, 20.1 %, and 30.4 % of the variance in self-care agency, respectively (p < 0.05). Women with higher levels of these traits demonstrated greater self-care capacity, while introversion, neuroticism, and inconsistency were linked to reduced self-care agency. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the significant role of personality traits in influencing self-care agency in this population. Tailoring supportive care to address individual personality characteristics may improve self-management and overall treatment outcomes. Incorporating psychosocial assessments into routine care and developing targeted interventions could enhance quality of life. Future research should focus on intervention studies to validate these approaches and optimize personalized care strategies in gynecological oncology."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify potential biomarkers for laryngeal cancer and investigate their effects on the characteristics of laryngeal cancer cells. METHODS: Transcriptomic data from laryngeal cancer and normal tissues were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Differentially expressed genes were screened, and their correlation with overall survival was analyzed. Five candidate genes-HOXC9, MARVELD1, HOXC8, GDF6, and SYT1-were selected for further validation. Gene expression was assessed by qPCR in normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells (NP69) and laryngeal cancer cell lines (TU138, TU686, TU212). SYT1, consistently overexpressed in cancer cells, was further investigated. Protein expression was confirmed by Western blot. SYT1 was knocked down using siRNA and lentiviral vectors. Functional assays included CCK-8 for viability, colony formation for proliferation, wound healing for migration, Transwell for invasion, and flow cytometry for apoptosis. SYT1 expression in clinical samples was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: HOXC9, MARVELD1, HOXC8, GDF6, and SYT1 were significantly upregulated in laryngeal cancer tissues and associated with poor overall survival. SYT1 was consistently overexpressed at both mRNA and protein levels in laryngeal cancer cells. SYT1 knockdown significantly inhibited cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promoted apoptosis. SYT1 expression positively correlated with tumor stage in clinical samples. CONCLUSION: SYT1 is overexpressed in laryngeal cancer and promotes malignant phenotypes. Its correlation with tumor stage suggests its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target."

    "abstract": "The dry fruits of Amomum villosum (Av) are a traditional Chinese medicine used for gastrointestinal disease. Aromatic oil has been reported to have anti-tumor properties. However, its therapeutic potential and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Integrated approaches of response surface design, gas chromatography-mass spectrum-driven network pharmacology analysis, transcriptomics, machine learning, clinic correlation analysis, single-cell sequencing, molecular docking, and dynamics simulation to characterize bioactive compounds in Av and further uncover their potential mechanisms against gastric cancer. The extraction process of aromatic oil was optimized using Box-Behnken design, and the optimal yield of 2.85 % was achieved under the conditions of extraction time of 6.5 h, solution ratio of 16 mL/g, and mesh size of 30. Subsequently, 28 compounds were identified from aromatic oils using the NIST 14 database. Survival curves indicated that the intersection of compound targets and cancer targets was highly correlated with gastric cancer (GC). Machine learning algorithms screened out HMOX1 as the key target from the public dataset and validated the clinic relevance. Single-cell sequencing indicated that HMOX1 might be a crucial immune regulator for myeloid cells. In vitro cell experiments showed that both aromatic oil and its primary compound, bornyl acetate, significantly suppressed HGC27 and AGS cell proliferation and migration, while downregulating HMOX1; bornyl acetate exhibited superior efficacy. Finally, molecular docking and dynamics showed that bornyl acetate had good binding affinity with HMOX1. Aromatic oil and bornyl acetate exert anti-gastric cancer effects via HMOX1, which provides a molecular basis for developing Av-derived therapy in GC therapy."

    "abstract": "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a xenosensor that mediates the toxic effects of exposure to environmental contaminants, such as polycyclic and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons. Besides its role in metabolism, the AHR is involved in several physiological and pathological processes, such as cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. In particular, the activation of the AHR is associated with greater susceptibility to cervical cancer development, and several AHR-driven gene signatures correlate with cervical cancer survival. However, many aspects of the processes and factors that determine AHR activation and cell localization during tumorigenesis remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to identify the mechanisms involved in the regulation of the cell density-dependent localization of the AHR in HeLa cells. The results show that the low cell density-dependent nuclear localization of the AHR is driven by the availability of tryptophan, an essential source of AHR ligands such as kynurenine. They also indicate that c-MYC expression is promoted at low cell density, mediating the induction of SLC1A5 and SLC3A2, genes encoding for solute carriers involved in tryptophan transport and cell uptake. Moreover, our data also establish that under low cell density conditions SLC1A5, SLC3A2, and AHR expression are under beta-catenin and c-MYC control. As beta-catenin promotes c-MYC gene induction, the current data allow us to propose that once cell-cell interaction is lost, the release of beta-catenin from its interaction with cadherin triggers AHR activation and nuclear internalization."

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a highly aggressive malignancy characterized by a poor prognosis, highlighting the critical need to elucidate its underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrate the pivotal oncogenic role of PRSS23 in PDAC pathogenesis. Clinical analyses reveal that PRSS23 is frequently overexpressed in PDAC tumor tissues, and elevated expression levels are significantly associated with reduced patient survival. Functional experiments show that PRSS23 knockdown markedly suppresses PDAC cell proliferation in vitro and inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Transcriptomic profiling identifies the Hippo signaling pathway as a key downstream effector of PRSS23. Specifically, depletion of PRSS23 leads to inactivation of YAP, the central transcriptional co-activator of the Hippo pathway. Molecular docking simulations suggest that PRSS23 facilitates the formation of a ternary complex involving the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A and the Hippo kinase MST1. Subsequent experimental validation confirms that PRSS23 silencing disrupts the interaction between PP2A and MST1, resulting in increased MST1 phosphorylation. This enhancement of MST1 activity promotes the phosphorylation and cytoplasmic sequestration of YAP, thereby suppressing its oncogenic transcriptional functions. Collectively, our findings establish PRSS23 as a novel prognostic biomarker and a crucial regulatory node in PDAC progression. PRSS23 drives tumorigenesis and metastasis by stabilizing the PP2A-MST1 interaction, which impairs Hippo pathway signaling and leads to aberrant YAP activation. Targeting the PRSS23/PP2A/MST1 axis may therefore represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PDAC."

METHOD: A qualitative phenomenological design guided by Transformative Learning Theory was employed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seventeen final-year nursing students who had completed oncology internships. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi's seven-step method with MAXQDA software. RESULTS: Three main themes were identified: (1) Implicit Learning Experience (e.g., disorienting dilemmas, shared assumptions), (2) Meaning-Making (e.g., emotional reflection, rational discourse, emotional and cognitive dissonance, unclear professional boundaries), and (3) Transformation (e.g., actions, awareness). CONCLUSIONS: Students' progression from implicit learning to transformation in sexuality care demonstrates the potential of transformative learning to address cultural and educational barriers. Structured, reflective, and experiential interventions are essential to enhance competence and confidence in this area."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer are recommended daily oral adjuvant endocrine therapy for at least 5 years, but up to 50 % discontinue early. We assessed an evidence-based, theoretically-informed, patient-centred intervention (HT&Me) to support adjuvant endocrine therapy adherence and improve quality-of-life, in terms of patient acceptability and feasibility to deliver within the UK National Health Service. METHODS: This single arm study aimed to recruit 45 women with stage I-III breast cancer within 14 weeks of first adjuvant endocrine therapy prescription. After completing baseline questionnaires, participants received the HT&Me intervention comprising: (i) a short animation; (ii) two personalised nurse/practitioner consultations (in-person or online); (iii) an interactive web-app; and (iv) regular email reminders. Participants completed follow-up questionnaires at 8 weeks. A sub-sample of participants (n = 20) and health professionals (n = 14) participated in semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: We recruited 51 participants. Participants varied in digital confidence at recruitment (low/moderate, 28 % (n = 14); high, 61 % (n = 31)). HT&Me was demonstrated as feasible to deliver. Overall, 69 % (n = 35) engaged with the web-app; 87 % (n = 40/46) found HT&Me helpful; and 80 % (n = 36/45) reported it motivated them to keep taking endocrine therapy. Both consultation formats were considered acceptable. Completion of outcome measures was high. Health professionals considered HT&Me addresses an important unmet need. CONCLUSIONS: HT&Me is feasible, acceptable and helpful to women. Findings provided valuable insights for design and delivery of the full-scale randomised controlled trial assessing effectiveness now underway (ISRCTN24852890). HT&Me offers potential to improve adjuvant endocrine therapy adherence, thereby reducing recurrence risk for women with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accurate preoperative assessment of endometrial cancer is crucial for tailoring surgical and therapeutic management. Identifying correlations between ultrasonographic features and tumor histopathological and molecular profiles may help improve the accuracy of presurgical staging. OBJECTIVES: This multicenter retrospective study aimed to evaluate the association between ultrasonographic features, histopathological characteristics and molecular profiles in endometrial cancer to improve preoperative assessment and risk stratification. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 156 women from three Italian centers underwent standardized transvaginal or transrectal ultrasound following IETA criteria prior to hysterectomy. Ultrasonographic parameters, including endometrial thickness, echogenicity, junctional zone integrity, and vascularity assessed by Doppler, were analyzed. Postoperative histopathology and molecular classification (p53, MMR, POLE, NSMP) were performed. Statistical analyses evaluated correlations among ultrasound features, pathology, and molecular data. RESULTS: Endometrioid histotype was detected in 88.46 % of cases, mostly low-grade and early-stage. Cases in the early stage (i.e. lesions confined to the uterine corpus) accounted for 77.27 % of all cases. Ultrasound staging was consistent with the final staging in 65.5 % of cases, with errors primarily involving the overestimation of p53-abnormal tumors and the underestimation of MMRd tumors. Increased endometrial thickness was associated with a higher stage and grade (median 20 mm for stage III, p = 0.007). An irregular junctional zone was associated with high-grade tumors (p = 0.016). Complex and multifocal vascular patterns were significantly linked to advanced stages, high grade, and molecular aggressiveness, such as p53 mutations and MMR deficiency. Tumors with scattered vessels showed a higher risk of extensive lymphovascular space invasion. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound features, particularly vascularity, junctional zone irregularity, and endometrial thickness, are significantly associated with tumor stage, grade, and molecular profiles. Incorporating detailed ultrasonographic assessment into preoperative evaluation can help identify high-risk endometrial cancers and guide personalized management strategies. Larger prospective studies are needed to validate these findings."

In the present study, a total of 60 flavone and chalcone derivatives containing benzimidazole groups were synthesized. The anti-proliferation tests revealed that most of the benzimidazole-chalcone derivatives exhibited excellent inhibitory activity against various tumor cell lines, while the benzimidazole-flavone derivatives showed relatively weak effects. Among the benzimidazole-chalcone derivatives, compound 19o with potential as a candidate anti-tumor drug was selected, and its anti-tumor biological activities in vitro and in vivo were evaluated. In the gastric cancer cell lines with superior anti-proliferation activity, compound 19o showed IC(50) values of less than 20 muM in MGC-803, SGC-7901 and HGC-27 cells, and it exhibited certain selectivity when compared with normal GES-1 cells. Compound 19o was verified to have inhibitory effects on colony formation and promote apoptosis in HGC-27 and SGC-7901 cells, and can block the cycle of HGC-27 cells in the G0/G1 phase. Further evaluation revealed that compound 19o inhibits the glycolytic pathway by suppressing the expression of HIF-1alpha and the key rate-limiting enzymes HK2 and PKM2 in glycolysis, and reduces the intracellular lactate content. In the HGC-27 xenograft nude mice, compound 19o was able to significantly inhibit the growth of tumors, and the inhibition rates at doses of 15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg were 30.95 % and 62.89 %, respectively. Furthermore, the compound 19o demonstrated certain safety in vivo, and exhibited acceptable pharmacokinetic properties after intravenous administration. Overall, the benzimidazole chalcone derivative 19o synthesized and screened in this study is a potential candidate drug for anti-tumor treatment."

    "abstract": "Despite extensive investigation into the anti-cancer activity of the natural polyphenol curcumin, its therapeutic application is restricted by its inherent physicochemical properties. Synthetic curcumin analogues, however, offer a promising strategy to improve the drug-like potential of curcumin. In this study, we evaluated three curcumin-based benzothiazepane analogues for their ability to selectively target colon cancer cells. Their cytotoxicity was assessed on intestinal cancerous HCT-116 and non-cancerous IPEC-J2 cells using cell viability assays and microscopic imaging. Two analogues, AT007 and AT096, demonstrated enhanced anti-cancer selectivity compared to curcumin. Interestingly, this effect correlated with the aggregation of these compounds in cell medium, which was influenced by compound concentration and medium composition (particularly the presence of albumin). Confocal microscopy confirmed the presence of particles up to 12 microm inside both cell lines, yet downstream metabolic and transcriptomic responses revealed distinct coping mechanisms that may underlie the higher survival of IPEC-J2 cells. Rather than direct molecular interactions typical of soluble compounds, the observed selectivity appears to result from indirect, particle-driven physical effects, potentially involving (intracellular) membrane disruption. Our findings suggest that aggregation behaviour can be a key determinant in improving the potency and selectivity of bioactive compounds, opening new opportunities for the design and screening of more selective anti-cancer therapeutics."

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a traditional therapeutic approach in China, and extensive clinical and basic research has shown its excellent antitumor efficacy. Dysregulation of lipid metabolism is one of the significant characteristics of malignant tumors, with mitochondria playing a crucial role. Inducers of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase/stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS/STING) pathway can influence the lipid metabolism of tumor cells. Here, we designed a polydopamine-based nanomaterial targeting mitochondria and encapsulated Cryptotanshinone to enhance cGAS/STING-mediated lipid metabolism and mitochondrial apoptosis, thereby exerting a targeted inhibitory effect on primary tumor lesions and ex vivo tumor cells. Consequently, our engineered nanosystem represents a novel strategy for promoting tumor lipid metabolism reprogramming and mitochondrial apoptosis through the modulation of the cGAS/STING pathway, thus addressing the significant challenge associated with regulating mitochondrial function to suppress Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)."

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. It is known for extensive infiltration, significant variability, and a high recurrence rate. Current standard treatments include maximal surgical removal and chemoradiotherapy. However, they offer limited benefit because of the tumor's invasive nature and resistance to systemic therapies. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) also impedes the delivery of effective treatments, underscoring the urgent need for innovative therapeutic approaches and delivery systems that can bypass the BBB and target disseminated tumor cells. The chemokine CXCL12, which interacts with the CXCR4 receptor, plays an important role in GBM progression by regulating key processes, including cell migration, invasion, blood vessel formation, maintenance of glioma stem-like cells, and the immune response. The CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling pathway creates chemotactic gradients that drive GBM cell movement into healthy brain tissue. This contributes to tumor recurrence and therapy resistance. Targeting this pathway could lead to a more effective strategy for directing tumor cells toward treatment areas. Accordingly, researchers have developed CXCL12-functionalized hydrogels as new therapeutic platforms. These hydrogels can capture invasive GBM cells and provide localized, sustained-release treatments across the BBB. This review explains the role of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in GBM biology and offers a thorough overview of hydrogel-based delivery systems, focusing on chemotactic mechanisms and CXCL12-functionalized hydrogels. It also discusses ongoing challenges and outlines future steps for applying these systems in clinical settings."

These factors not only initiate tumor development but also promote chronic inflammation and activate key oncogenic pathways, including NF-kappaB signaling and pro-angiogenic cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. Research into emerging therapeutic approaches has identified metal-based compounds-especially ruthenium(II) complexes-as promising alternatives to traditional platinum-based drugs. In this study, we report the design, synthesis and X-RAY characterization of a ruthenium(II) complex incorporating a quinoline-chalcone hybrid ligand, designed for enhanced anticancer and anti-inflammatory potential. The resulting compound, referred to as complex 2, demonstrated significant activity against HPV-negative head and neck cancer cell lines. It exhibited strong cytostatic, antiproliferative, and migrastatic effects, along marked suppression of NF-kappaB activation and a notable decrease in IL-6 and IL-8 levels due to direct interactions. These findings highlight complex 2 as a promising multitarget agent capable of targeting both tumor progression and the inflammatory microenvironment. Overall, complex 2 is a potential candidate for combination therapies targeting head and neck cancer."

Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were analyzed to further explore the potential mediating influence of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on the PIV-mortality relationship. METHODS: We included 3773 cancer survivors from NHANES (2003-2018). Mortality follow-up was conducted via linkage to the National Death Index. Associations between PIV and mortality outcomes were assessed using restricted cubic spline curves and weighted multivariable Cox regression. Mediation analysis evaluated whether eGFR partly explains the effect of PIV on mortality. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 84.75 months, 1137 deaths occurred (all-cause: 30.14 %; CVD: 8.32 %; cancer: 9.09 %). Using an optimal cutoff of 344.63, participants were classified into low (n = 2335) and high PIV (n = 1438) groups. In fully adjusted models, high PIV was associated with increased risks of all-cause mortality (HR 1.36, 95 % CI 1.18-1.56) and cancer-related mortality (HR 1.42, 95 % CI 1.10-1.82). eGFR mediated 9.10 % of the association between PIV and all-cause mortality and 11.47 % for CVD mortality, but not significantly for cancer mortality. CONCLUSION: Elevated PIV independently predicts higher all-cause and cancer-specific mortality in cancer survivors. The findings suggest that PIV may serve as a practical prognostic marker, with renal function partially accounting for its link to mortality."

We hypothesized that the increased risk of pancreatic cancer among individuals infected with Helicobacter pylori decreases over time after eradication treatment. METHODS: This multinational and population-based cohort study, using prospectively collected nationwide register data from 1995 to 2019, included all adults who received eradication treatment for Helicobacter pylori in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, or Sweden. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 %CI) were calculated by dividing the incidence rates of pancreatic cancer in the eradication treatment cohort by that of the entire populations of the corresponding age, sex, calendar year, and country. The main outcome was changes in SIR over time after eradication treatment. RESULTS: During up to 24 years of follow-up of 661,827 participants and 5494,255 person-years in the eradication treatment cohort, 2331 participants developed pancreatic cancer. The risk of pancreatic cancer was increased during the first 1-5 years after eradication treatment (SIR 1.14, 95 % CI 1.07-1.21), after which it decreased and became similar to the level of the background population 6-10 years (SIR 0.99, 95 % CI 0.92-1.07) and 11-24 years (SIR 1.00, 95 % CI 0.92-1.08) after eradication treatment.

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a fundamental, highly conserved cellular process with a complex dual role in breast cancer progression and therapy resistance. Initially, autophagy functions as a tumor suppressor by maintaining genomic stability through clearance of damaged organelles and reducing oxidative stress, preventing tumor initiation. In established tumors, autophagy supports cancer cell survival under metabolic stress, sustains cancer stem cell stemness, and facilitates adaptation to hypoxia and nutrient deprivation in the tumor microenvironment. This pro-survival role enhances tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapies. Autophagy extensively interacts with key signaling pathways governing cancer stem cell renewal and immune evasion, underscoring its multifaceted impact on tumor biology. Given its pivotal role, autophagy modulation via established inhibitors such as chloroquine alone and in combination with several other novel agents are under clinical investigation to investigate if its action that could be used to overcome therapy resistance and improve patient outcomes in breast cancer."

    "abstract": "Hyaluronidase 1 (HYAL1), a key enzyme in hyaluronic acid (HA) metabolism, exhibits a perplexing paradoxical character in tumor biology. This review systematically delineates the dual roles of HYAL1 in cancer: on one hand, by degrading HA to generate low-molecular-weight fragments with pro-angiogenic and immunomodulatory activities, HYAL1 promotes tumor progression and metastasis in various malignancies, including prostate cancer, esophageal carcinoma, and osteosarcoma; on the other hand, it demonstrates tumor-suppressive properties in specific contexts such as colorectal cancer models. This functional contradiction underscores the context-dependent nature of HYAL1, whose activity and effects are profoundly influenced by tumor type, microenvironmental features, and epigenetic regulation. Mechanistically, HYAL1 functions not only through the classical HA-CD44 signaling axis but also by regulating the MMPs/TIMPs balance, integrin activation, and cytoskeletal reorganization. Recent studies reveal that HYAL1 expression is directly controlled by epigenetic regulators like BRD2, while its activity can be monitored in real-time using novel bioluminescent probes, providing powerful tools for investigating its dynamic functions. Notably, HYAL1-based therapeutic strategies have shown considerable promise, particularly in oncolytic virotherapy, where HYAL1-expressing recombinant viruses significantly enhance the penetration and efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents and immune cells within tumors. Key challenges persist, including HA metabolic complexity, functional redundancy among hyaluronidases, and HA fragment instability. Future research must decipher HYAL1's context-specific roles within tumor heterogeneity, elucidate its epigenetic regulation, and develop targeted strategies. A deeper understanding of this HYAL1 paradox is essential to leverage its potential for precision cancer therapies targeting HA metabolism."

Furthermore, the study considers a wide range of deep learning classifiers alongside balancing techniques to address data imbalance. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the CNN with BERT representation model compared to the BiLSTM, LSTM, RNN, and RNNLSTM models. The findings indicate an F1-score of approximately 96%, suggesting the potential for predicting patient sentiment from textual feedback. By automating feedback analysis, this approach enables KHCC to detect dissatisfaction, identify unmet needs, and act on key concerns promptly.

In addition, high reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was obtained for the pathogenic bacteria cells by light-sensitive CQ-dot@HA-Gd/Fe(III) microgels upon 30 min UV-A light treatment that triggered the destruction of the Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538)."

    "abstract": "Endoxifen is the most powerful metabolite of tamoxifen (TX), the main endocrine therapy administered worldwide for the treatment of estrogen-receptor (ER) positive metastatic breast cancer. Tamoxifen itself is a prodrug with weak affinity for ER, but it is converted into endoxifen, with up to 100-fold higher affinity for ER than TX. In this study, we introduce the first fluorescent endoxifen derivative (FLTX3), formed by covalent attachment of the small fluorophore NBD to the basic side chain of endoxifen. We have characterized the optical properties of FLTX3, demonstrating its ability as a laser dye. FLTX3 is an efficient target-directed fluorescent probe for the cellular labelling of ER in MCF7 breast cancer cell line as well as in uterine tissues. FLTX3 is also endowed with an intrinsic photodynamic effect when irradiated at the optimal excitation wavelength of FLTX3. Further, we show that FLTX3 has an optical gain behaviour that leads to random laser (RL) when the light emitted by the drug is scattered in the cell cultures. Indeed, analyses of coherent spectra by power function Fourier transform revealed a RL dominant cavity in the range of average cell sizes. As one of the main causes for tamoxifen treatment failure is resistance, we explored the potential discriminative value of FLTX3-induced RL between tamoxifen-resistant and tamoxifen-sensitive MCF7 cells. Using multivariate approaches, we unravelled significant differences in the RL signal between tamoxifen-sensitive and tamoxifen-resistant cells. These findings indicate that FLTX3-generated RL might provide a target-directed diagnostic tool for tamoxifen resistance in metastatic ER+ breast cancer."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Expert pathology review plays a crucial role in gynecologic oncology, where diagnostic complexity can substantially affect patient management and medico-legal accountability. This study aimed to assess the frequency, nature, and impact of diagnostic revisions arising from second opinion evaluations of gynecologic lesions. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 319 consecutive cases of gynecologic lesions submitted for second opinion review by a senior gynecologic pathologist at a tertiary referral center between 2018 and 2024. Each case was categorized as concordant, minorly discrepant, or majorly discrepant compared with the referring diagnosis. Clinical impact and medico-legal relevance were systematically evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 319 reviewed cases, 47.0% were fully concordant with the original diagnosis, whereas 34.5% exhibited major discrepancies and 18.5% minor discrepancies. The most frequent sources of diagnostic disagreement involved tumor histotype, grade, and determination of the primary site. Ovarian and endometrial specimens accounted for most revisions. Diagnostic reinterpretation led to changes in clinical management in 54.9% of cases, and potential medico-legal implications were identified in 11.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Expert second opinion pathology in gynecologic oncology revealed a high rate of diagnostically and clinically significant revisions. Routine implementation of specialist review for complex or high-risk gynecologic lesions is strongly recommended to improve diagnostic accuracy, guide appropriate patient care, and reduce medico-legal risk."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Substantial metabolic reprogramming accompanies the transition from cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet the metabolomic profile of cirrhotic liver tissue containing HCC remains insufficiently defined. METHODS: Metabolomic data from 203 cirrhotic tissue samples and 37 HCC tissue samples were obtained from the MetaboLights repository (dataset MTBLS8764). Multivariate statistical approaches, including principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), were applied to delineate metabolic differences between groups. Discriminatory metabolites were identified using variable importance in projection (VIP) scores and fold-change analysis. Diagnostic performance was assessed through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for both individual metabolites and multi-metabolite panels. Complementary transcriptomic data were subjected to KEGG pathway enrichment and an integrated multi-omics evaluation to uncover biological pathways underlying disease progression. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses revealed significant metabolic divergence between cirrhotic and HCC tissues. PCA and supervised PLS-DA showed distinct group separation, and the OPLS-DA model demonstrated strong reliability (R(2)Y = 0.694, Q(2) = 0.39; p < 0.001). Fifty-seven metabolites showed significant differential abundance. ROC analysis indicated that combining four metabolites, 6-bromotryptophan, threonate, palmitoylcholine, and oleoylcholine, significantly improved diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.83, p < 0.001). KEGG enrichment analysis of metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets identified disrupted pathways in amino acid metabolism, oxidative stress, and lipid remodeling. Integrated multi-omics analysis further revealed coordinated alterations in the \"choline metabolism in cancer\" pathway, implicating this axis as a key contributor to HCC development. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive metabolomic framework identifies promising biomarkers and distinct metabolic signatures that differentiate cirrhosis from HCC and offers mechanistic insights to guide future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The optimal integration of immunotherapy with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains an area of active investigation. While consolidation immunotherapy is standard, the efficacy and safety of a neoadjuvant approach are not yet established by phase III trials. This real-world study compares outcomes between neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy followed by CRT (NEO) and CRT followed by adjuvant immunotherapy (ADJ, the PACIFIC regimen). METHODS: In this multicenter retrospective analysis, we reviewed data from patients with stage III NSCLC who received radical thoracic radiotherapy and peri-radiotherapy immunotherapy between January 2020 and December 2023. Patients were classified into NEO (n = 321) or ADJ (n = 142) groups. Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included treatment patterns, recurrence modes, and incidence of pneumonitis. Propensity score matching (PSM) and robust statistical analyses were used to minimize confounding. RESULTS: The median PFS was significantly longer in the NEO group than in the ADJ group (25.0 months vs. 16.3 months; HR = 0.57, 95 % CI: 0.43-0.74; p < 0.001). Median OS was not reached (NR) in the NEO group compared to 41.1 months in the ADJ group (HR = 0.54, 95 % CI: 0.37-0.78; p = 0.001). The survival benefit for the NEO group remained consistent after PSM and multivariable adjustment. The objective response rate to neoadjuvant therapy was 68.4 %. Patterns of recurrence were similar between groups, with distant metastasis being the most common site of first progression. The incidence of grade >/=2 radiation pneumonitis was comparable (31.8 % NEO vs. 30.8 % ADJ, p = 0.925), though a non-significant trend towards higher grade >/=3 radiation pneumonitis was observed in the NEO group (14.0 % vs. 7.5 %, p = 0.071). Rates of checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis were low and similar between groups. CONCLUSION: In this large real-world cohort, a treatment sequence incorporating neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy prior to definitive CRT was associated with significantly improved PFS and OS compared to the standard adjuvant immunotherapy approach, without a definitive increase in severe pneumonitis. These findings support the further investigation of neoadjuvant immunotherapy strategies in phase III randomized trials for stage III NSCLC."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The identification of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) patients who may benefit from first-line chemo-immunotherapy (CIT) remains a challenge. This study aimed to develop a pathomics model to predict the T cell-inflamed gene-expression profile (GEP) status and validate its utility in identifying patients who derive survival benefit from CIT. METHODS: The pathomics model was developed using whole-slide images and RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) LUSC cohort (n = 334) to predict the GEP status and generate a pathomics score (PS). The predictive value of PS was validated in a prospective, multicenter trial (AK105-302, n = 267) by assessing its interaction with treatment (CIT vs. chemotherapy) for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Two additional independent cohorts (n = 82 and n = 50) were used for external validation. RESULTS: The pathomics model accurately predicted GEP status, achieving area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.80 and 0.71 in the TCGA training and validation sets, respectively. In the AK105-302 cohort, significant interactions were identified between PS and treatment modalities for both PFS (interaction p = 0.011) and OS (interaction p < 0.001). Patients with high PS who received CIT exhibited significantly prolonged PFS (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.31, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.21-0.48, p < 0.001) and OS (HR: 0.30, 95 % CI: 0.18-0.50, p < 0.001) compared to high PS patients receiving chemotherapy. However, this survival benefit was not observed in the low-PS patients. These findings were corroborated in two independent clinical cohorts. Furthermore, biological assessments revealed a significant association between high PS and an immune-hot tumor microenvironment. CONCLUSION: We developed a GEP-based pathomics model that provides a practical, cost-effective strategy to identify patients most likely to derive superior survival benefit from first-line CIT over chemotherapy alone."

Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) can assist by flagging potentially eligible individuals using Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data. We developed a CDSS to identify people aged 50-70 who currently or formerly smoked cigarettes (with an unknown quit date or cessation within the past 10 years) for use in Australian general practice EMRs. This study aimed to: (1) assess the algorithm's accuracy in identifying eligible patients, (2) estimate NLCSP eligibility based on audited EMR smoking data, and (3) evaluate EMR data quality for applying the PLCO(m2012) risk prediction tool. A cross-sectional EMR audit was conducted across five Victorian general practices. Of 4,186 records flagged by the CDSS, 1,315 (31.4 %) were manually audited. The algorithm correctly identified all patients according to its rules (age and smoking status). Pack-year could be calculated for 226 patients (17.2 %), with 91 (6.9 %) meeting NLCSP eligibility. Eligibility was higher among people who currently smoke (9.2 %) than those who formerly smoked (3.6 %). A subset of 933 records was assessed for PLCOm2012 variables, revealing substantial data gaps (% missing): education level (100 %), ethnicity (58 %), BMI (57 %), and daily cigarette consumption (33 %). CDSS algorithms can identify potential NLCSP participants, but confirmation of smoking history remains essential due to sub-optimal smoking data quality. Significant data limitations currently hinder PLCO(m2012) implementation via CDSS in general practice EMRs."

    "abstract": "PURPOSES: To explore the prognostic value of dual-tracer PET/CT-derived parameters and develop a predictive model for castration-resistant prostate cancer-free survival (CRPC-FS) in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). METHODS: Forty-five mHSPC patients who underwent prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT prior to novel hormone therapy (NHT) were included between October 2020 and March 2024. A total of 1,661 PSMA-positive and 303 FDG-positive lesions were evaluated to quantify tumor burden, including maximum standardized uptake value, metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion uptake under different relative fixed threshold values. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses assessed their association with CRPC-FS. Internal validation was performed using 1000-bootstrap resampling. Classification and regression tree identified optimal cut-offs. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analysis evaluated model discrimination. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, only MTV of prostate cancer was significantly associated with CRPC-FS (p < 0.05). PSMA-derived (C-index = 0.662) MTV and FDG-derived (C-index = 0.712) MTV under a 40 % threshold exhibited the strongest predictive power and remained independent in multivariable analysis. Internal validation demonstrated favorable model performance and good calibration. The cut-off values for the two parameters were identified as 4.77 and 66.425, respectively. Furthermore, patients were stratified into prognostic groups to develop a risk model with AUCs > 0.85. CONCLUSIONS: MTV exhibited superior prognostic value for CRPC-FS in patients with mHSPC compared to other PET/CT-derived and clinical parameters. Moreover, FDG-derived MTV showed stronger prognostic value than PSMA-derived MTV. The dual-tracer PET/CT-derived model could comprehensively assess tumor burden and aid in early prognostic stratification."

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of non-CF patients who had E. dermatitidis isolated from respiratory specimens. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled in the study. E. dermatitidis was isolated from sputum aspirated by bronchoscopy (n = 6), sputum (n = 5), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (n = 1), and empyema pus (n = 1). Preceding pulmonary comorbidities included bronchiectasis (n = 6), COPD (n = 4), nontuberculous Mycobacterium (NTM) infection (n = 3), lung cancer (n = 2), interstitial lung disease (ILD) (n = 2), and asthma (n = 2). Non-pulmonary immunosuppressive comorbidities included diabetes (n = 4), immunosuppressive drug use (n = 3), and malignancies treated with chemotherapy (n = 2). Six patients (46.2 %) were defined as \"definite\" infection and seven (53.8 %) were as \"possible\" infection. Levels of serum beta-D-glucan (cut-off <20 pg/mL) were elevated in two of 10 patients. Chest CT showed various shadows such as bronchiectasis (n = 9), infiltrative shadow (n = 9), and mucoid impaction (n = 8). Among six patients who were treated with itraconazole (ITCZ), three patients improved, one was unchanged, and two worsened. Despite ITCZ therapy, one patient died due to exacerbation of ILD. In the non-treated group, two patients died due to advanced lung cancer. NTM was also detected with E. dermatitidis in three patients. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that E. dermatitidis may cause respiratory infections in patients with bronchiectasis or immunocompromised conditions. Further studies are needed to distinguish colonization from true infection of E. dermatitidis in the respiratory tract."

Multiple sclerosis (MS) plays an important role not only in pathogenesis but also in the antitumour response. Therefore, we investigated the causal relationship and pathogenesis between BC and MS via integrated Mendelian randomization (MR) and bioinformatics analysis. METHODS: We performed MR analyses to investigate the potential causal relationship between BC and MS via the IEU database. A comprehensive strategy among least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, support vector machine, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, time ROC regression, and survival analysis was adopted to construct and validate the prognostic model. Immune cell infiltration and chemotherapy sensitivity were used to evaluate the prognostic model. RESULTS: MR analysis revealed that MS was causally associated with the incidence risk of BC. Patients in the high-risk group were related to worse survival, immune infiltration, and increased sensitivity to paclitaxel, methotrexate, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, and sunitinib. Furthermore, KLRC1 was expressed at low levels in BC tissues and correlated with poor prognosis and immune cell infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a potential causal association between MS and BC. KLRC1 is a robust and promising biomarker for predicting the prognosis of patients with MS and BC."

This study aimed to provide a comprehensive bibliometric overview of global areca-related research, elucidating its publication trends, intellectual structure, and emerging research frontiers. METHODS: Publications from 1985 to 2024 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. Bibliometric analyses were performed to visualize publication outputs, regional and institutional contributions, journal distributions, co-cited references, and keyword evolution. Temporal and network analyses were conducted to identify major research clusters and developmental trajectories. RESULTS: A total of 2882 articles from 91 regions and 2865 institutions were analysed. Global publications have increased markedly over the past decade. Among the leading contributing regions are India, Taiwan, China, and the Chinese mainland. Co-citation and keyword analyses revealed several major thematic domains: areca toxicity, oral submucous fibrosis, oral cancer, and synergistic effects with tobacco and alcohol. Recent trends indicate a shift from epidemiological and clinical characterization toward mechanistic and translational studies, focusing on fibrosis and carcinogenic signalling pathways. CONCLUSION: This study provides the comprehensive landscape of global areca research, outlining its intellectual evolution and emerging frontiers. Integrating multidisciplinary and international collaborations will be critical for advancing mechanistic understanding and guiding evidence-based prevention strategies. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: By elucidating the global research landscape of areca, this analysis offers a scientific foundation for developing targeted public health interventions and clinical strategies to mitigate areca-related oral diseases and carcinogenesis."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Radon is a leading cause of lung cancer and poses an even greater risk for people who smoke. Maps are used to educate the public about radon and promote testing, yet their effectiveness is rarely evaluated. This study investigated the effects of a radon risk map-in collaboration with a provincial health agency-on testing intentions. An exploratory aim was to assess potential mechanisms, applying psychological insights on risk perception, to evaluate how maps function as risk communication tools. STUDY DESIGN: Online experiment conducted in December 2023 with a quota-sampled panel of residents. METHODS: 1716 British Columbia residents completed measures of radon risk perceptions and testing intentions before and after viewing a risk map adapted from the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control. All participants viewed a pre-experiment prompt on the importance of protecting against radon, especially if you smoke/have smoked. Multilevel regression models assessed changes in testing intentions across subgroups. Path analysis tested worry as a mediator, controlling for demographic covariates. RESULTS: Participants in medium-high- or high-radon-risk areas reported significantly higher average radon testing intentions post-experiment (p < 0.001), irrespective of smoking status. A small decrease was observed among non-smokers living in the lowest ecological risk areas (p < 0.001). Changes in worry appeared to mediate the association between participants' radon risk level and testing intentions. CONCLUSION: Results suggest maps can influence perceptions of risk and encourage radon testing in high-risk areas. In low-risk areas, communications emphasizing the severity of lung cancer and its occurrence in non-smokers may enhance public education and promote testing."

    "abstract": "The best surgical timing for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, whether primary debulking surgery or interval debulking surgery, remains debated. Recent data, including the preliminary ones from TRUST trial, necessitates an updated critical evaluation. A systematic search of PubMed identified only randomized controlled trials comparing interval debulking surgery versus primary debulking surgery in patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer. Primary outcomes included overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). A random-effects meta-analysis, meta-regression, cumulative synthesis, and leave-one-out influence analysis were performed. A total of 2303 patients were included. Compared to primary debulking surgery, interval debulking surgery was associated with lower rates of postoperative complications (OR = 0.37; 95 % CI: 0.18-0.79; P = 0.01) and mortality (OR = 0.23; 95 % CI: 0.09-0.57; P = 0.002). Meta-analysis showed higher rates of complete cytoreduction with interval debulking surgery (OR = 3.84; 95 % CI: 2.14-6.91; P < 0.00001) and lower rates of macroscopic residual disease (OR = 0.20; 95 % CI: 0.13-0.30; P < 0.00001). Pooled data revealed no significant difference in OS (HR = 0.95; 95 % CI: 0.87-1.04; P = 0.26) or PFS (HR = 0.94; 95 % CI: 0.85-1.03; P = 0.16). Subgroup analyses by stage and residual disease confirmed similar survival outcomes. The meta-regression results suggested that even in trials with very high complete cytoreduction rates, no clinically meaningful OS benefit was observed for upfront surgery. In conclusion, interval debulking surgery offers comparable survival outcomes to primary debulking, with reduced perioperative morbidity and mortality, supporting its role as a valid surgical alternative.

BACKGROUND: HCWs play a crucial role in the early prevention and management of CRL. However, existing research on their KAP has largely relied on scale-based total score approaches, which overlook individual heterogeneity. Meanwhile, on the practical side, there is a lack of a systematic environment conducive to supporting HCWs in lymphedema services. DESIGN: Cross-sectional design. METHOD: This study surveyed 1130 healthcare workers from 21 Chinese hospitals between December 2024 and January 2025. Latent profile analysis profiled KAP-based subgroups, whose predictive factors and learning method preferences were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models and DCAT. Barriers to service implementation were explored via latent Dirichlet allocation. RESULTS: Three latent class profiles were identified: low-level, medium-level and high-level KAP. Education, experience in CRL management, professional title and department significantly influenced the KAP categories. Preferences for instructional strategies varied across profiles: Groups 1 and 2 favored structured instruction, whereas Group 3 preferred methods enriched with interactive elements. Thematic analysis identified several key barriers to lymphedema service implementation by HCWs, including resource investment, public awareness, medical security coverage, etc. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal heterogeneous KAP profiles and distinct learning method preferences among HCWs. This heterogeneity suggests a potential direction for developing stratified training tailored to specific needs or competency levels. Future optimization of the lymphedema care environment requires multifaceted interventions at the policy, regulatory, staffing and patient levels."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of consecutive patients who underwent prostate MRI followed by systematic biopsy with or without targeted biopsy between January 2019 and December 2020 was performed. Whole-gland (wgPSAD), transition-zone prostate-specific antigen density (tzPSAD), and peripheral-zone prostate-specific antigen density (pzPSAD) were calculated using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels drawn before imaging, and volume estimates were derived from MRI using artificial intelligence (AI) software assistance. Diagnostic performance was assessed using logistic regression and estimating internally validated receiver operating characteristic area under the characteristic (AUC) curves. RESULTS: A total of 551 patients with a median age of 66 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 61-72) were included. The univariable analysis demonstrated superior AUC for wgPSAD (AUC: 0.71 and 0.71) and tzPSAD (AUC: 0.72 and 0.72) compared to pzPSAD (AUC: 0.51 and 0.56) for any cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). The multivariable analysis including age and 5alpha-reductase inhibitor therapy demonstrated a superior AUC of tzPSAD for predicting csPCa (AUC: 0.77 vs 0.75; P=0.02) compared to both wgPSAD and pzPSAD (AUC: 0.77 vs 0.67; P<0.001). Variable importance analysis suggested prescribed 5alpha-reductase inhibitor therapy may be protective against csPCa. CONCLUSION: wgPSAD and tzPSAD are superior to pzPSAD for the detection of csPCa. When accounting for key covariates, tzPSAD may be superior to wgPSAD."

To address this, we investigated the relationship between breast cancer and exposure to individual PM(2.5) and PM(10) components, as well as their combined effects, in the French E3N-Generation cohort. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study within the cohort (1990-2011), including 5,222 incident breast cancer cases matched to 5,222 controls. Annual mean concentrations (microg/m(3)) of pollutants at residential addresses were estimated using the CHIMERE chemistry-transport model from 1990 to the index date. Exposure assessment included nine PM components: ammonium, sulfate, black carbon, polychlorobiphenyl-153 (PCB153), nitrate, benzo[a]pyrene, cadmium, dioxins, and Saharan dust. We evaluated single-pollutant effects using logistic regressions, and mixture effects using Quantile G-computation (QGC) and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR). RESULTS: Significant positive associations with breast cancer (Odds Ratios and confidence intervals for one SD increase (controls distribution) were found for ammonium (OR = 1.19; 95%CI: 1.05-1.35), sulfate (OR = 1.17; 95%CI: 1.02-1.35), PCB153 (OR = 1.17; 95%CI: 1.08-1.26), nitrate (OR = 1.16; 95%CI: 1.01-1.33), black carbon (OR = 1.12; 95%CI: 1.05-1.20), cadmium (OR = 1.05; 95%CI: 1.00-1.11). QGC showed a positive association with breast cancer for a one-quartile increase in joint exposure (OR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.00-1.50) with cadmium and nitrate as major contributors. BKMR confirmed a significant positive association between the exposure to the mixture and breast cancer. CONCLUSION: The consistency between single-pollutant and mixture analyses supports a role for multiple PM components acting jointly on breast cancer risk. These results suggest that the chemical composition of PM, rather than individual pollutants alone, is a key determinant of breast cancer risk, highlighting the importance of considering pollutant composition in air pollution research."

    "abstract": "Cuproptosis has been identified as a unique copper-dependent cell death mechanism that may provide new opportunities for improving tumor therapy outcomes. For currently developed cuproptosis inducers, nonspecific copper release and low levels of copper accumulation in tumors restrict their clinical applications. To precisely manage copper ion release in vivo, a stimuli-responsive 'cuproptosis switch' was designed as an intelligent platform with pH-sensitive 'off' and 'on' states, thereby inducing cancer-specific cuproptosis while guaranteeing biosecurity. A bilayer copper nanocapsule containing Cu(2)O and Cu(2-x)Se shells was demonstrated with a switch-like pH-dependent Cu(+) release profile across a transition pH (6.8) based on their distinct degradable properties. To boost cuproptosis-targeted therapy efficacy, the STING activating agonist MSA-2 was encapsulated in the Cu(2)O/Cu(2-x)Se nanocapsule for establishing lasting and effective immune responses. Cuproptosis-sensitization effects induced by US irradiation and MSA-2 release were elucidated, including 1) up-regulating Cu influx transporter (SLC31A1) expression and down-regulating Cu efflux transporter (ATP7A) expression to increase intracellular copper overload; 2) facilitating rapid GSH depletion for cuproptosis sensitization in the cytoplasm; 3) increasing mitochondrion membrane permeability for intracellular released Cu(+) ions entering the mitochondrion. The TME-specific Cu(+) and MSA-2 release combined with US-irradiated, spatiotemporally located ROS amplification induced tumor-specific cuproptosis, initiated immunogenic cell death, and activated cGAS-STING pathway for boosting robust and durable antitumor efficacy. As a result, complete elimination of primary and distant tumors in mice was achieved at low doses without side effects. The US-sensitized cuproptosis switch may provide opportunities for elimination of local residual tumors and abscopal metastatic foci for final tumor eradication."

    "abstract": "The development of multidrug resistance (MDR) to anticancer agents following chronic treatment remains a significant obstacle in cancer chemotherapy. Overexpression of the energy-dependent drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) has been identified as a major contributor to MDR. Inspired by naturally occurring MDR-reversing cyclic peptides, a series of readily accessible valine thiazole-containing derivatives were designed and synthesized as effective reversal agents against P-gp-mediated MDR based on a hybridization strategy. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis demonstrated that linear valine thiazole derivatives possess greater MDR reversal activity than their macrocyclic analogs. Compound 17e displayed promising synergistic activity by significantly enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel (PTX) against KBV cells (IC(50) = 2.8 nM, reversal fold = 288.5) without inducing obvious toxicity. 17e exhibited approximately 8-fold greater potency than verapamil (VRP), 2-fold greater potency than the third-generation P-gp inhibitor tariquidar (TAR) in KBV cells. Mechanistic studies confirmed that 17e inhibits the efflux function of P-gp in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting its expression, thereby increasing intracellular chemotherapeutic drug accumulation and causing G(2)/M phase arrests, which is associated with increased apoptosis. Taken together, the linear valine thiazole derivative 17e represents a promising starting scaffold for developing novel P-gp inhibitors against MDR."

    "abstract": "We report a rare case of thyroid cancer with tumor embolism of the internal jugular vein (IJV) that progressed cranially into the skull base and caused multiple cranial neuropathies. An 80-year-old woman presented with a progressively enlarging right cervical mass, which had been neglected for 10 years. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a cystic cervical lesion with a tumor embolism within the IJV extending to the jugular foramen and hypoglossal and facial canals. Fine-needle aspiration cytology yielded inconclusive results on two occasions, likely because of cystic degeneration. The patient developed facial paralysis, tongue deviation, and vocal cord paralysis. Biopsy confirmed papillary thyroid carcinoma with poorly differentiated areas. The patient elected the best supportive care and passed away four months after diagnosis. Cranial progression was likely facilitated by venous stasis due to an intraluminal tumor thrombus combined with the biological aggressiveness of dedifferentiation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of thyroid cancer with retrograde IJV tumor embolism that led to skull base invasion and jugular foramen syndrome. This case highlights the variability in thyroid cancer extension patterns, which can occasionally result in highly atypical and clinically significant manifestations."

However, the precise mechanisms of SPDEF in regulating NSCLC pathogenesis remain to be fully characterized. METHODS: Bioinformatics analyses were used to identify disease-associated TFs and downstream targets. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to predict hub TFs. The relationship between SPDEF and BIRC5 was validated by luciferase and ChIP assays. The influences on cell phenotypes were evaluated by testing cell colony formation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis. Xenograft studies were used to explore the role in tumor growth. RESULTS: This study revealed 101 disease-associated TFs in NSCLC. GO enrichment analysis of these TFs demonstrated significant enrichment in biological processes including lung development, lung differentiation, and Wnt signaling pathway. PPI analysis revealed FOXA1, GATA6, TBX2, and SPDEF as core regulatory factors. SPDEF and BIRC5 levels were upregulated in NSCLC tumors and cell lines. Mechanistically, SPDEF induced BIRC5 upregulation through transcriptional regulation. SPDEF depletion impaired NSCLC cell invasion, migration, and clonogenicity while inducing apoptosis in vitro, which could be abolished by BIRC5 reconstitution. Moreover, SPDEF deficiency inhibited A549 tumor growth in subcutaneous xenograft models. Additionally, BIRC5 activated the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in NSCLC cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the tumor-promoting function of SPDEF in NSCLC by transcriptionally activating BIRC5, highlighting SPDEF as a candidate target for future NSCLC-directed therapies."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Compression of morbidity may be linked to belonging to particular social strata defined by intersections of age, gender, migration and occupation. Extending the approach by Crimmins and Beltran-Sanchez, we investigated compression of morbidity, defined as reduced socially stratified prevalence of self-reported heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes and functional limitations, using two samples 15 years apart. METHODS: We used data of eleven European countries from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), comparing 2004 (N = 29,224) and 2019/2020 (N = 46,498) samples, to apply multilevel logistic regressions within an intersectional MAIHDA (Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy) framework. FINDINGS: Overall patterns did not show compression of morbidity in terms of lower prevalence after 15 years, but intersectional analyses revealed specific compression patterns. Certain strata showed reduced heart disease prevalence, with older men with migration background experiencing the strongest declines from initially high levels. However, no social stratum showed morbidity compression for stroke. Blue-collar low-skill men exhibited particularly increased cancer prevalence across waves. Among older men, diabetes prevalence increased substantially. Reductions in functional limitation prevalence emerged across waves for all female groups aged 70-79, and for blue-collar high-skill men. INTERPRETATION: Overall, we found that compression of morbidity was largely intersectionally stratified, evidencing the impact of social inequalities in healthy life expectancy. This calls for stratified preventive measures at public health level in the future. FUNDING: Einstein Foundation Berlin (EZ-2019-555-2)."

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Decisions regarding endometrial cancer (EC) adjuvant therapy can be challenging due to the need to balance the benefits of recurrence reduction with treatment toxicity. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has the potential to guide adjuvant therapy decisions by stratifying patients based on their risk of recurrence. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between perioperative ctDNA positivity and survival outcomes in patients with EC. METHODS: An electronic search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Web of Science and included all articles up to July 23rd, 2025. Studies were included if they assessed patients with EC who had ctDNA assessment before and/or after surgery and reported on survival outcomes. Meta-analysis was done to explore the association between ctDNA levels and survival. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the association between ctDNA positivity pre- or post-operatively and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Of 2862 articles reviewed, 11 met inclusion criteria, which led to reporting on 1298 patients. Pre-operative as well as post-operative ctDNA positivity was significantly associated with worse PFS (HR 3.69 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 2.58-5.26], HR 12.61 [95 % CI, 8.78-18.13] respectively), with no significant heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that perioperative detection of ctDNA positivity is significantly associated with worse PFS and could serve as a valuable tool for EC prognostication and guidance for adjuvant therapy decision-making. Prospective studies that evaluate the role of ctDNA in EC are needed for this to be implemented in clinical practice."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate how HFD-induced metabolic changes modulate the tumor immune microenvironment through the STAT3/CD155 axis. METHODS: Murine colorectal cancer models using control, CD155-overexpressing (CD155 OE), and STAT3 knockdown CT26 cells were established under normal or HFD conditions with anti - PD-L1 treatment. Tumor growth, immune infiltration, and gene expression were analyzed by flow cytometry, Western blotting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: HFD impaired anti - PD-L1 efficacy and accelerated tumor growth. Mechanistically, HFD promoted STAT3 nuclear translocation and CD155 upregulation, reducing CD8(+) T cell infiltration and enhancing regulatory T cell accumulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed direct STAT3 binding to the CD155 promoter, while STAT3 knockdown reversed these effects and restored antitumor immunity in HFD-fed mice. CONCLUSION: HFD-induced metabolic stress drives immune evasion via the STAT3/CD155 axis. Targeting this pathway may improve ICB efficacy in obesity-related cancers."

    "abstract": "Melanoma is a highly aggressive and heterogeneous form of skin cancer with limited effective treatment options. Although substantial progress has been made in immunotherapy, chemotherapy still serves as an essential alternative therapeutic strategy for many patients. Diphenyl disulfide (DPDS), a small molecule composed of two phenyl groups linked by a disulfide bond, has been reported to exert antioxidant and anticancer activities across several types of malignancies. In this study, we examined the cytotoxic effects of DPDS on melanoma cells and investigated the underlying mechanisms responsible for its antitumor activity. Our results showed that DPDS induces both ferroptosis and apoptosis in melanoma cells in a time-dependent manner. At 24 h, DPDS promoted lipid peroxidation, enhanced xCT ubiquitination, and reduced GPX4 expression, all of which are characteristic hallmarks of ferroptosis. Whereas at 48 h, apoptosis occurred, likely because of NRF2 phosphorylation inhibition, which initially protected against cell death. Additionally, DPDS inhibited the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, leading to decreased mTOR expression and increased autophagy levels. Furthermore, the inhibition of ferroptosis or autophagy partially restored cell viability, suggesting a complex interplay between these pathways in DPDS-induced cytotoxicity. These findings highlight that DPDS may be a potential therapeutic agent for melanoma that functions by leveraging dual programmed cell death mechanisms and targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway."

    "abstract": "Dendrobium officinale polysaccharides (DOP) exhibit anticancer potential against colorectal cancer (CRC), yet their mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated DOP's effects on HCT-116 cells. DOP dose- and time-dependently inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis, evidenced by elevated cleaved caspase-3/-9, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), Bax, and reduced Bcl-2. Concurrently, DOP activated autophagy (increased LC3-II/I, Beclin-1; decreased p62) via phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) suppression. Combining DOP with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine enhanced apoptosis (higher cleaved PARP, Bax; lower Bcl-2) and reactivated PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. These findings demonstrate DOP inhibits CRC by dual induction of apoptosis and autophagy blockade through PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibition, with autophagy suppression synergistically augmenting apoptosis. The study highlights DOP's translational potential as a functional food or adjuvant therapy, proposing a novel combinatorial strategy for CRC treatment."

Conventional treatments such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy are limited by severe side effects and drug resistance. Natural products offer a safer, multitargeted approach to cancer therapy. Curcuma caesia, a medicinal plant used in traditional medicine, was investigated for its anticancer potential. Using bioactivity-guided isolation, 14 fractions of its hexane extract were screened against CAL 27 oral cancer cells. Two fractions, NPSU HC and NPSU HJ, showed potent cytotoxicity with IC(50) values of 40.78 and 45.60 microg/mL, respectively, and inhibited cell migration and colony formation. NPSU HC induced S- and G2-phase arrest, whereas NPSU HJ increased S-phase cell accumulation. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified 14 phytochemicals, which was followed by the isolation of four sesquiterpenoids, furanodienone, zederone, germacrone, and curcumenol. Among them, furanodienone displayed the most potent activity with IC(50) of 85.41 microM on CAL 27 cell line, causing G2-phase arrest and suppressing cancer cell proliferation. Molecular docking showed strong binding affinities, particularly for furanodienone, toward key oral cancer targets such as CDK6, HRAS, PIK3CA, and MYH9. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations further confirmed the stable interaction between furanodienone and CDK6, supporting its potential as a promising oral cancer therapeutic candidate."

This study investigates endoscopic and histological findings over a 15-year period in patients with first-degree relatives of gastric cancer intestinal type who underwent follow-up upper gastrointestinal endoscopies. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: we conducted a retrospective real-world observational study involving patients who underwent at least two upper gastrointestinal endoscopies between 2008 and 2023 at Sant'Andrea Hospital, Rome. The study analyzed histological findings, dividing participants into four subgroups based on their baseline conditions [H. pylori infection, gastric atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia]. RESULTS: 106 patients were included, only 13% were indicated for follow-up endoscopy according to the MAPS guidelines. An additional 13% of patients developed precancerous conditions, most of whom were H. pylori positive at the index examination, with an odds ratio risk of 6.778 (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: performing routinely virtual chromoendoscopy during the index endoscopy in these patients could improve the detection of precancerous conditions. Special attention should be given to H. pylori-positive patients due to their increased risk of developing precancerous conditions, for whom follow-up endoscopies may be beneficial."

    "abstract": "The role of platelets in blood coagulation and vascular repair is well known. In recent years, extensive attention has been given to the fact that the impact of tumors on peripheral blood platelets plays a key role in cancer progression. This review systematically summarizes the latest research progress on how tumors regulate the quantity, volume, composition, and activation status of peripheral blood platelets through multiple mechanisms. First, tumor cells can induce excessive platelet production by activating AhR-RUNX1 signaling through paracrine pathways and the release of kynurenine, thereby leading to thrombocytosis, which is associated with advanced tumor stages, metastasis, and poor prognosis. Second, tumor progression may trigger disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or chemotherapy-related bone marrow suppression, which in turn results in consumptive thrombocytopenia. In addition, dynamic changes in the mean platelet volume (MPV) are related to tumor type and progression stage, which may reflect abnormal megakaryocyte differentiation or inflammatory status. In terms of platelet composition, tumor cells can remodel the proteome and transcriptome of platelets by secreting ADP, IgG, and functional RNA. Changes in RNA profiles have been confirmed to have potential for tumor diagnosis. In terms of activation status, tumor cells can induce platelet activation and aggregation (TCIPA) by releasing procoagulant factors such as tissue factors and exosomes (EVs), accelerating thrombosis and promoting angiogenesis. In clinical applications, platelet-related biomarkers have become a research hotspot for early cancer diagnosis and prognostic evaluation. Moreover, targeting platelets affected by tumors provides new strategies for tumor treatment. On the basis of the scientific findings of numerous existing studies, it is speculated that there seems to be a \"dynamic balance\" among platelets, which also provides a new direction for future research."

METHODS: Frequently asked questions on oral health and HNC therapy side effects were identified via ChatGPT-GPT-4-turbo and Gemini-2.5 Flash, then submitted to eight LLMs (ChatGPT-GPT-4-turbo, Gemini-2.5 Flash, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, Chatsonic, Mistral, Meta AI-Llama 4, DeepSeek-R1). Responses were assessed using DISCERN and modified DISCERN instruments (reliability and quality), Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT [understandability and actionability]), Flesch-Reading-Ease-Score (FRES [readability]), misinformation score, citations, and wordcounts. Statistical analysis was done by Scheirer-Ray-Hare-test followed by Dunn's post-hoc-tests and Bonferroni-Holm correction (p < 0.05). RESULTS: A total of 40 questions belonging to 12 oral health-related categories were identified. Statistically significant differences between LLMs were found for DISCERN, modified DISCERN, PEMAT-understandability, PEMAT-actionability, FRES, and word counts (p < 0.001). Median DISCERN and modified DISCERN scores amounted from 47.0 (ChatGPT-GPT-4-turbo) to 59.0 (Perplexity, Chatsonic) and from 2.0 (Gemini-2.5 Flash, Mistral) to 5.0 (Perplexity) indicating good to fair reliability. LLMs were understandable (median PEMAT-understandability scores >/= 75.0), but provided limited specific guidance (median PEMAT-actionability scores </= 40) and used complex language (median FRES </= 40.2). Misinformation risk was generally low and not statistically significant among LLMs (p = 0.768). CONCLUSION: Despite a low overall misinformation risk, deficits in actionability highlight the need for cautious integration of LLMs into HNC patient education."

Native to the Patagonian regions of Chile and Argentina, this berry showcases impressive adaptability and versatility across various environmental conditions. Its rich composition, high in polyphenols, anthocyanins, and vitamin C, underpins its growing prominence in food and nutraceutical industries. The chemical profile of Calafate reveals substantial nutritional value, with notable concentrations of anthocyanins such as delphinidin-3-glucoside and petunidin-3-glucoside, which are associated with its antioxidant properties. Studies highlight the role of Calafate in reducing oxidative stress and obesity-related inflammation, showing potential protective effects against chronic diseases. In vitro studies support these findings, demonstrating Calafate;s ability to reduce inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity, and protect against neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Research in animal models suggests that Calafate supplementation can enhance metabolic markers related to insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and cardiovascular health. This review uniquely integrates nutritional, chemical, and preclinical evidence on Calafate, highlighting its potential as a functional food and nutraceutical source. At the same time, it underscores key gaps, most notably the lack of human clinical studies, the need for extract standardization, and limited knowledge on bioavailability and long-term safety, thereby outlining priorities for future research and clinical translation."

Nevertheless, the interchangeability between distinct pretreatment strategies is poorly defined. Herein, two traceable IDMS methods, immune mass spectrometry (IMS) and direct mass spectrometry (DMS), that combine immunoaffinity or antibody-free pretreatment were established for the quantification of plasma ProGRP, which is a recognized biomarker for small cell lung cancer. The internal standard curve was established using NLLGLIEAK, an enzymatic hydrolysis peptide of ProGRP, and its isotope-labeled molecule to ensure quantitative traceability. A microliter high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry platform was established for sensitive quantification of ProGRP in the range of 0.398-13.8 ng/mL. Correction factors were introduced to eliminate the effects of protein loss and enzyme digestion efficiency on the quantitative results, which were 86.84% for IMS and 85.48% for DMS. The RSDs of IMS and DMS were 5.5% and 4.3%, respectively. The comparability among the established MS methods and two immune methods was studied using plasma from patients with abnormally high expression of ProGRP. The IMS and DMS results showed good consistency and good correlation with the results of clinical chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA), while the correlation between CLIA and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results was poor. The factors affecting quantification accuracy by MS analysis and immunoassay were discussed, revealing the potential of IMS and DMS as reference measurement procedures for protein biomarkers in complex matrices."

However, serum vitamin D level could differ between countries according to geographic, genetic, and dietary factors. AIM OF THE WORK: Cosidering that most studies of relations between vitamin D level and breast cancer were conducted outside Africa and considering the fact that populations differ in sun exposure, dietary habits, and genetic construction, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between serum levels of vitamin D3 and vitamin D- binding protein (VDBP) with pathological response, clinicopathological characteristics, and various biological markers in Egyptian breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). METHODS: A total of 71 female breast cancer patients (mean age: 57 years) were enrolled in this prospective observational study. Fasting blood samples were collected 1 day before and 3 months after initiation of NACT. Serum levels of vitamin D3 and V DBP were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Tumor expression of Ki-67, HER2, progesterone receptor (PR), and estrogen receptor (ER) was assessed via immunohistochemistry. Serum levels of CA 15-3 and Bcl-2 were also measured. RESULTS: Complete pathological response (pCR) was achieved in 44 patients (68.7%). A statistically significant increase in both vitamin D3 and VDBP levels was observed following NACT (p < 0.001). Lower pre- and post-treatment levels of vitamin D3 and VDBP were significantly associated with postmenopausal status, higher tumor grade and stage, triple-negative breast cancer subtype, and high Ki-67 expression (p < 0.001). Conversely, higher levels were significantly associated with achieving pCR (p < 0.001). Both vitamin D3 and VDBP levels demonstrated a significant negative correlation with tumor stage and grade (p < 0.001). Among different clinical and laboratory parameters, only triple-negative subtype and baseline vitamin D were significantly predictive for pCR by multivariable analysis (OR 1.488 and 0.506, respectively) and (95% CI 1.109-1.825 and 0.331-0.75, respectively). CONCLUSION: Serum levels of vitamin D3 and VDBP significantly increased after NACT and were associated with favorable clinicopathological features and pCR. Only triple-negative subtype and baseline vitamin D were significantly predictive for pCR by multivariable analysis. These findings suggest that vitamin D3 and VDBP may serve as potential prognostic indicators in breast cancer management."

Recent studies have confirmed that metabolic reprogramming plays a significant role in cancer progression. This study aims to further clarify the underlying mechanisms that the tumor suppressor miR-1343-3p exerts anti-gastric cancer effects via glucose metabolic reprogramming pathways. METHODS: High-throughput sequencing combined with bioinformatics analysis predicted significantly differentially expressed miRNAs and target mRNAs after salidroside treatment. RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) was used to verify miRNA interaction with its downstream target protein, while co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) was applied to confirm downstream target proteins interaction. The IC(50) of salidroside was determined by in vitro CCK-8 assay and colony formation experiment. qRT-PCR, Western blot, ELISA, and ATP detection were used to evaluate cancer cell proliferation, miRNA-mRNA expression and metabolite changes. Cancer cells were transfection with miR-1343-3p mimics or inhibitors, OGDHL-targeted siRNA (si-OGDHL), to verify the effects of salidroside against cancers. In vivo tumor-bearing nude mouse models after salidroside or miR-1343-3p agomir treatments were applied to analyze the targeted miRNA-mRNA molecules expression and metabolite changes. RESULTS: Bioinformatics confirmed that tumor suppressor miR-1343-3p down-regulated OGDHL expression, a key alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex subunit of TCA cycle. Our findings first verified that OGDHL interacted with PDHB, a key pyruvate dehydrogenase E1-beta subunit in gastric cancer. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that salidroside inhibited GC growth in a time and dose-dependent way through up-regulating tumor suppressor miR-1343-3p, down-regulating OGDHL expression, destabilizing PDHB protein homeostasis, reducing pyruvate oxidative decarboxylation, and decreasing acetyl-CoA and ATP production. CONCLUSION: Tumor suppressor miR-1343-3p inhibited gastric cancer cell proliferation by regulating OGDHL/PDHB-pyruvate glucose metabolism axis, which lay a better basis for targeted therapeutic strategy in cancers."

An up-to-date evaluation of this change can increase public awareness and facilitate health policy development. METHODS: The data were extracted from the Global Burden of Diseases Study (GBD) 2021. Epidemiological changes of morbidity and mortality in different regions, as well as the differences in gender and age were analyzed. Temporal trends were determined using Joinpoint regression analysis and age-period-cohort analysis was employed to evaluate the effects of age, period, and cohort. RESULTS: Globally, there were 99,543.67 new cases (95% UI 80957.40-120401.87) and 92,227.78 deaths (95% UI 75053.11-112,160.27) in 2021, increased by 158.92% and 141.61%, respectively, compared to 1990. Decomposition analysis revealed that population growth was the primary driver of the increased morbidity (41.13%) and mortality (54.87%). The global estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) of morbidity and mortality exhibited an ascending trend, while differences existed across different regions. The morbidity and mortality rates were higher in males than in females across all age groups. Joinpoint regression analysis showed an increased morbidity and mortality rate. The age effect indicated that the highest risk was observed at 75-79 years for morbidity and 80-84 years for mortality. The period effect showed an increasing risk, while improving cohort risks for mortality were identified. CONCLUSION: Alcoholic liver cancer has posed an increasing health burden since 1990, particularly affecting male and the elderly population. Effective prevention policies on specific age groups should be formulated to improve this situation."

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) analysis and flow cytometry demonstrated that RH-GO/AgNO(3) treatment elevated oxidative stress and triggered apoptosis in HeLa cells. Furthermore, 5-fluorouracil (FU) was successfully loaded onto the nanocomposite surface via non-covalent interactions. Cytotoxicity assessment by MTT assay showed that FU-loaded RH-GO/AgNO(3) had the strongest anticancer activity, with an IC(50) value of 256.3 microg/mL. ROS levels in treated HeLacells increased significantly (40.17%) compared to the control group (19.45%), and flow cytometry confirmed a reduction in cell viability (69.5%) accompanied by enhanced apoptosis (early: 8.3%, late: 4.0%) and necrosis (18.2%). Collectively, these findings indicate that RH-GO/AgNO(3)-FU induces cancer cell death predominantly via apoptosis.

Although many reports have used acoustic analysis for oral cancer patients, few studies have focused on the extent of tongue resection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of acoustic analysis in the assessment of postoperative speech impairment in oral cancer patients. METHODS: Postoperative speech data as well as Speech Handicap Index (SHI) and 5-point speech intelligibility scale were collected from 65 patients including 31 cases of oral cancer resection without glossectomy, 18 cases of partial glossectomy, and 16 cases of subtotal glossectomy. Speech data were acoustically analyzed by triangular vowel space area, vowel articulation index (VAI), first (F1) and second (F2) formant slopes, and compared according to the extent of tongue resection. RESULTS: The frequency of speech impairment assessed by SHI and 5-point speech intelligibility scale was differed according to the extent of tongue resection. As acoustic analysis, VAI and F1 slope in cases of subtotal glossectomy were significantly smaller than those in cases of partial glossectomy. F2 slope in cases of subtotal glossectomy was significantly smaller than those in the other cases. CONCLUSION: Acoustic analysis was potentially useful as an objective speech assessment for the patients who underwent oral cancer surgery."

We have clinically observed that patients with baseline regular laxative administration, most of whom were on magnesium oxide, exhibited less chemotherapy-induced constipation than those without, and assessed its impact on symptom development in real-world cisplatin-containing treatment. METHODS: Patients with lung cancer receiving cisplatin-containing treatment (n = 240) were divided into a control group without baseline laxative administration and a magnesium group with baseline regular magnesium oxide administration and retrospectively evaluated. The primary endpoint was evaluation of the incidence of grade >/= 2 constipation during the first 7 days following treatment initiation. RESULTS: Incidence of grade >/= 2 constipation was 82.5% in the control group and 50.0% in the magnesium group, which was significantly less in the magnesium group (P < 0.0001). The incidence of all-grade symptoms was also significantly lower in the magnesium group than in the control group (67.5% vs. 84.5%, P = 0.02). Additionally, the administration of new laxatives was less common in the magnesium group (P = 0.007). Multivariable logistic regression analysis suggested that baseline administration of magnesium oxide is a preventive factor for grade >/= 2 constipation. Furthermore, patients receiving 2 g daily magnesium oxide at baseline developed significantly less grade >/= 2 constipation than those with < 2 g (19.1% and 84.2%, respectively, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that patients with baseline regular magnesium oxide administration exhibit less chemotherapy-induced constipation than those without the administration in cisplatin-containing treatments."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Esophagojejunal (EJ) leakage is a serious complication following total gastrectomy for gastric cancer. While several nutritional and treatment-related risk factors have been described, the role of Candida esophagitis (CE) in anastomotic failure has not been previously investigated. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 268 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent total gastrectomy with EJ anastomosis. The study was conducted between March 2021 and March 2025 at a tertiary referral center. CE was diagnosed by histopathologic examination of proximal esophageal margins submitted during surgery. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine predictors of EJ leakage. Best subsets variable selection using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) guided final model development. RESULTS: Among the 268 patients, 48 (17.9%) developed EJ leakage. Multivariable analysis identified CE (OR: 2.19, p = 0.043), hypoalbuminemia (< 3.5 g/dL) (OR: 3.08, p = 0.007), BMI >/= 25 kg/m(2) (OR: 3.68, p = 0.004), and administration of neoadjuvant therapy (OR: 2.34, p = 0.024) as independent predictors of EJ leakage. Additional analyses of diagnostic timing indicated that CE detected only on permanent histology (delayed treatment) was associated with higher odds of leak (adj OR 3.62; 95%CI: 1.42-9.23; p = 0.007), whereas CE detected on intraoperative frozen section was not. CONCLUSION: CE was associated with increased odds of EJ leakage after adjustment, but causality cannot be inferred from this retrospective study. The finding that delayed CE diagnosis was linked to higher leak risk suggests diagnostic timing may matter. Prospective validation of targeted esophageal assessment and timed antifungal strategies is warranted. Elevated BMI, hypoalbuminemia, and neoadjuvant therapy also contributed to higher odds of EJ leakage."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To clinically validate fully automated intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) planning for head and neck cancer (HNC) through blinded comparison with manual plans by experienced radiation oncologists (ROs). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty patients with HNC treated with a manually created IMPT plan were retrospectively included. Dose prescription was 7000 cGy (relative biologic effectiveness) to the primary tumor and 5425 cGy (relative biologic effectiveness) to the bilateral elective nodal volumes. Fully automated IMPT plans were generated using Erasmus-iCycle, applying the same clinical 4-beam configuration and dose constraints. Three experienced HNC ROs independently assessed the automated and corresponding manual plans in a blinded manner. Each RO evaluated both plans, blinded to the planning method, to determine clinical acceptability and indicate their preference, if any. Interobserver differences in preference were evaluated using pairwise McNemar tests. A generalized linear mixed model was used to assess overall preference for automated plans. RESULTS: All 30 automated IMPT plans were considered clinically acceptable, whereas 28 of the 30 manual plans were rated clinically acceptable by all 3 ROs. In 28 out of 30 cases, the ROs unanimously (P = 1.00 between each pair of observers) preferred the automated plan. In the remaining 2 cases, 1 of the 3 ROs had no preference. The manual plan was never preferred. The overall preference for automated plans over no preference was statistically significant (P< .001). Target coverage was considered equivalent, whereas target conformality and sparing of both serial and parallel organs at risk were generally rated superior in the automated plans. CONCLUSIONS: All fully automated IMPT plans for HNC were considered clinically acceptable by experienced HNC ROs. Automated plans were unanimously preferred over manually created plans in nearly all cases, with statistical significance, highlighting the clinical potential of automated IMPT planning tools."

    "abstract": "CO2 laser resurfacing is a widely used cosmetic procedure for facial rejuvenation, addressing wrinkles, scars, and other skin imperfections. Although complications are rare, post-laser skin lesions have been reported, particularly in patients with a history of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). This report presents a rare case of a 41-year-old female that developed a solitary keratoacanthoma (KA) 3 weeks after CO2 laser resurfacing. A detailed medical history was taken, and an excisional biopsy was performed. Histopathological examination confirmed KA, a rare but documented complication of fractional laser resurfacing. The lesion was excised without recurrence, and healing was uneventful. This case is unique because the patient had no prior NMSC history, making KA an unusual occurrence. Previous studies typically associate KA with known risk factors such as NMSC or immunosuppression. This report highlights the importance of post-laser surveillance, even in patients without recognized risk factors. It contributes to the understanding of potential complications of CO2 laser resurfacing, emphasizing the need for clinical awareness."

METHODS: This research analyzes the characteristics of dermatomyositis in women. A retrospective cross-sectional study evaluated clinical presentation, muscle involvement, immunological markers, association with malignancy, complications, and mortality in females during a 15-year follow-up at a tertiary dermatology center. RESULTS: Thirty women (mean age 63.6 +/- 11.6 years) were analyzed. The most common skin manifestations were the V-sign (73.3%), followed by a heliotrope rash and Gottron's papules (70.0% each). Periungual erythema appeared in 50.0%, and the shawl sign in 46.7%. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis linked the V-sign with age >/= 62.5 years (area under the curve = 0.75) and periungual erythema with age </= 68.5 (area under the curve = 0.76). Muscle weakness was present in 63.3% of cases. Myositis-associated autoantibodies and myositis-specific autoantibodies were positive in 53.3%. Seven patients (23.3%) had malignancy-associated dermatomyositis, including ovarian, breast, endometrial, lung, gastric, and nasopharyngeal cancers. CONCLUSIONS: The V-sign, a heliotrope rash, and Gottron's papules were the most common skin findings. Muscle involvement affected nearly two-thirds of patients. Malignancy was detected in almost a quarter of patients, emphasizing the need for thorough evaluation and early diagnosis, especially in cancer-associated cases."

    "abstract": "Tobacco is a major cause of chronic diseases such as lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease worldwide. Nicotine, the primary psychoactive component in tobacco, is highly addictive and while not the primary driver of such tobacco-related diseases, poses various health risks, particularly those affecting the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. Although nicotine-based therapies, such as nicotine replacement products, are widely utilized in smoking cessation efforts today, the impact of newer, tobacco delivery systems such as electronic nicotine delivery systems, or ENDS, remains uncertain and warrants continued evaluation. This study aims to develop and validate a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulation model for nicotine using clinical pharmacokinetic data. The PBPK simulation model for nicotine was developed by incorporating drug-specific and system-specific parameters and by considering the systemic absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of nicotine as well as its overall pharmacokinetic behavior on GastroPlus version 9.9. Validation of the developed PBPK model was performed by comparing predicted and observed plasma concentration-time profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters from clinical studies across multiple routes of administration including intravenous infusion, bolus, and pulmonary inhalation. The resulting model accurately captured plasma nicotine concentrations, with predicted pharmacokinetic parameters (C(max), T(max) and AUCs) falling within acceptable ranges of observed values and computational average fold error values. The current model provides a practical tool to translate systemic nicotine exposure across delivery systems, support dose optimization against predefined target exposure, and quantify safety margins, thereby informing safer product design and evidence-based decisions in public-health regulatory science."

    "abstract": "While proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) show epidemiological associations with gastrointestinal disorders, their mechanistic basis remains unclear. The pharmacological effects of a drug are determined not only by its direct protein targets but also by genes involved in its metabolism and transport. Using two-sample Mendelian randomization and multi-ancestry cohorts (UKB/FinnGen), we systematically assessed genes encoding both direct targets of PPIs and key proteins involved in PPI pharmacokinetics across 24 gastrointestinal diseases. Validation included colocalization/SMR analyses, disease stratification, anatomical stratification, and HPA-based tissue expression profiling. Single-cell sequencing further elucidated target distribution. Finally, meta-analysis validates the correlation between PPI and gastrointestinal disorders. CYP2D6 emerged as the most pleiotropic locus (nine disease endpoints), demonstrating dose-dependent carcinogenic effects in hepatocellular/pancreatic cancers (OR = 1.36-1.58, p = 8.45 x 10(-24), OR = 1.43-1.56, p = 2.31 x 10(-72)) yet protective against acute/chronic pancreatitis (OR = 0.72-0.75, p = 1.26 x 10(-196), OR = 0.62-0.67, p = 1.39 x 10(-111)). ABCB1/SLC22A1 exhibited pan-gastrointestinal risk modulation. Anatomical stratification revealed context-dependent gene effects: SLC22A1 (esophageal), CYP2D6 (hepatic), and CYP2C19 (colorectal) showed opposing roles in carcinogenesis versus precancerous states. HPA profiling identified SLC22A3 as a pan-cancer candidate (moderate-high expression in 4 tumor types). Single-cell tumor data indicated AHR was enriched in tumor cells and significantly higher than in normal cells in all five tumor tissues. The finding suggests that AHR may be related to the potential gastrointestinal carcinogenicity of PPIs. The meta-analysis confirms a significant link between PPI use and increased gastrointestinal cancer risk. Further research is needed on PPI and benign gastrointestinal diseases. Our multi-omics integration reveals tissue-specific PPI pharmacodynamics, identifying targets with dual therapeutic/carcinogenic potential that may explain epidemiological discordances."

This study is among the first comprehensive audits of late effects experienced by paediatric cancer survivors from the long-term follow-up (LTFU) clinic at KK Women's and Children's Hospital in Singapore, between September 2017 and December 2023. METHOD: A total of 485 survivors were examined, all of whom had at least 2 years of treatment and 5 years of remission. Data on cancer diagnoses, treatments and late effects were analysed, with severity classified by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. RESULTS: The analysis showed 394 survivors (81%) experienced at least 1 late effect. Body mass index >/=23 kg/m2 or >/=90th percentile, low bone mineral density (e.g. Z-score </=-2.0 standard deviation score) and hearing difficulties were observed in 149 (30.7%), 87 (17.9%) and 73 (15.1%) survivors, respectively. Leukaemia survivors' detection of their first late effect was 10-14 years postdiagnosis, while central nervous system (CNS) and solid tumour survivors detected their first late effect within </=5 years. Majority of late effects were of mild CTCAE severity. The odd ratio of developing late effects in the first 5 years post-diagnosis was 4.88 (95% confidence interval 2.98-7.71, P<0.001) in survivors treated with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy (with and without surgery) compared to chemotherapy (with and without surgery). CONCLUSION: Despite risk-adapted protocols, timely screening is recommended to improve early detection of metabolic health, bone health and hearing impairment. Radiotherapy-treated survivors and survivors of CNS tumours and solid tumours would benefit from earlier and frequent screening. Adopting an exposure-based approach to proactively screen for late effects, coupled with survivor education, can help mitigate the biopsychosocial impacts."

    "abstract": "This study modified the solvent-exposed region of sunitinib by replacing its diethylaminoethyl tail with linear and heterocyclic amines, guided by lipophilicity, steric, and electronic considerations to enhance the anticancer activity and selectivity. Sunitinib and its 20 derivatives, including 14 new compounds (4a, 4c, 4d, 4g-4i, 5a, 5b, 7a-7e, and 8) and 6 known compounds (4b, 4e-4f, 5c-5d, and 6), were successfully synthesized. The cytotoxic effects of sunitinib and its derivatives were evaluated against three human cancer cell lines (HeLa, SH-SY5Y, and HepG2) and one normal cell line (L929) using the MTT assay. Sunitinib exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity toward SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, with an IC(5)(0) of 3.88 microM. Among the derivatives, compound 5b showed the highest potency with an IC(5)(0) of 4.28 microM against SH-SY5Y. Compound 6 displayed the highest selectivity index (SI >/= 5) for HeLa, indicating good selectivity toward cancer over normal cells. Overall, these results suggest that targeted modification of the solvent-exposed region in sunitinib can improve anticancer activity without toxicity against normal cell lines, with compound 5b emerging as a promising lead for further development, particularly against neuroblastoma. The solvent-exposed region is strategic for drug development, allowing modifications that improve affinity, selectivity, solubility, and pharmacokinetics without disrupting ligand-protein interactions."

    "abstract": "Solid tumors are characterized by a metabolically dysregulated tumor microenvironment (TME) enriched with reactive oxygen species (ROS), which suppresses immune cell function. Natural killer (NK) cells are promising effectors in cancer immunotherapy due to their intrinsic cytotoxicity without prior antigen sensitization. However, oxidative stress impairs NK cell cytotoxicity by reducing degranulation, interferon-gamma production, and survival. Therefore, maintaining NK cell redox balance is a crucial obstacle to achieving optimal therapeutic results in ROS-rich TMEs. Here, we proposed a straightforward, non-genetic ex vivo membrane modification approach to reinforce the redox balance of NK cells via ROS scavenging. Using tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), a mild reducing agent, we selectively introduced free thiol groups onto the exterior surface of NK cell plasma membranes. The engineered surface-thiol-riched NK cells (STR-NK) demonstrated (1) increased membrane thiols, (2) efficiently eliminated extracellular ROS, (3) attenuated intracellular ROS accumulation, and (4) preserved cytotoxicity-associated gene expression under oxidative stress. Importantly, STR-NK cells maintained potent cytotoxicity against diverse solid tumor cells despite the presence of ROS. Overall, this uncomplicated and scalable surface redox modulation approach enhances NK cell anticancer activity under oxidative stress, offering a promising strategy to improve NK cell-based cancer immunotherapies in ROS-enriched solid TMEs."

    "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting cell-surface molecules are pivotal in biomedical research, diagnostic applications, and biotechnology. Over the past four decades, the CD nomenclature system, established by the Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens Workshops and endorsed by the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS), has provided a standardized naming convention for both mAbs and the cell surface molecules they target. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest family of cell-surface receptors, playing essential roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Despite their significance, GPCRs are underrepresented in terms of well-validated mAbs available for flow cytometry and therapeutic applications. At the Eleventh HLDA Workshop (HLDA11), new CD nomenclature has been assigned to thirteen GPCR cell-surface molecules expressed on immune cells: CD198 (CCR8), CD199 (CCR9), CD372 (CCR10), CD373 (CX3CR1), CD374 (XCR1), CD375 (GPR15), CDw376 (GPR26), CD377 (SSTR3), CD378 (C3AR1), CDw379 (FPR2), CD380 (LTB4R), CDw381 (GPR183), and CDw382 (F2RL1). In this article, we introduce the newly established CD nomenclature for mAbs targeting the GPCR family. We detail the quantitative expression profiles of these molecules on various subsets of leukocytes and provide validation data for these mAbs. The implications of these expression profiles are discussed for the potential therapeutic targeting of immune-mediated diseases and cancer."

METHODS: Fifty-four patients were randomized into three groups. Group 1 performed 8 weeks of strength training. Groups 2 and 3 combined 4 weeks of strength training with 4 weeks of skill training. Group 3 received high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) during training. Group 2 received sham HD-tDCS. RESULTS: Overall adherence and exercise adherence remained above 75% across all groups. Home-based HD-tDCS proved safe and feasible, with mild to moderate side effects (tingling, itching, or burning). Median exercise performance levels for strength training exercises ranged from 94% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the feasibility of high-volume strength and skill training with HD-tDCS in patients with C-RAD.

    "abstract": "The immune system orchestrates a delicate balance between robust defense against pathogens and restraint to prevent tissue damage, with T cells serving as central mediators of adaptive immunity. The canonical pathway for T-cell activation hinges on the precise recognition of peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules via the T-cell receptor (TCR), which is complemented by essential co-stimulatory signals. However, this model alone cannot fully explain the nuanced contextualization of immune responses, particularly how T cells integrate signals related to the nature of the threat. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which are traditionally studied in innate immune cells, are recognized as critical regulators of T cell function, challenging the conventional dichotomy between innate and adaptive immunity. T cell-intrinsic PRR signaling integrates endogenous danger signals and microbes to modulate critical processes, including cytokine production, proliferation, and polarization, thereby shaping immune responses and disease outcomes in contexts ranging from viral infections to chronic inflammation and cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying PRR-mediated T cell regulation and their contributions to immune homeostasis or pathology remain incompletely understood. This study investigates the role of T cell-intrinsic PRR signaling in shaping immune responses and its implications for disease. By elucidating key signaling pathways and their impact on T cell function, we aim to offer novel insights into the complex regulation of T cell-mediated immunity and uncover an underappreciated paradigm for immune-related disorders, providing new insights into the pathogenesis of inflammatory and neoplastic diseases."

Evidence for structured psychological interventions during radiotherapy remains limited. This study evaluated the longitudinal effects of a structured education plus entertainment therapy intervention on anxiety, depression, and quality of life in mainland China breast cancer patients during and after radiotherapy using linear mixed model analysis.MethodsThis single-center, parallel-group, assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial enrolled 280 female breast cancer patients (aged 18-75 years) receiving adjuvant radiotherapy. Participants were randomized 1:1 to intervention (structured education plus entertainment therapy) or control (standard care). Primary outcomes were Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) trajectories assessed at baseline (T0), mid-radiotherapy (T1), end of radiotherapy (T2), and 1, 3, and 6 months post-radiotherapy (T3-T5). Secondary outcomes included quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30/BR23 domains), acute toxicity (CTCAE v5.0), and adherence. Linear mixed models with group x time interaction assessed intervention effects.ResultsOf 280 randomized patients, 252 (90%) completed the T5 assessment. The intervention group showed significantly improved SAS trajectory (group x time interaction beta = -1.82, 95% CI: -3.14 to -0.50, P = 0.007) with estimated marginal mean difference of -3.45 points at T5. SDS trajectory improvement was marginally significant (beta = -1.56, 95% CI: -3.12 to 0.01, P = 0.051). Minimal clinically important difference (MCID, >/=0.5 SD improvement) was achieved by 48.6% vs 31.4% for anxiety (P = 0.004) and 42.1% vs 29.3% for depression (P = 0.027) for intervention and control groups, respectively. Global health status improved significantly (beta = 4.23, P < 0.001). Grade >/=2 radiation dermatitis occurred in 37.1% vs 48.6% (P = 0.055) in intervention and control groups, respectively. High adherence (>/=70% sessions) in 72.1% of intervention patients was associated with greater benefits.ConclusionsThe structured education plus entertainment therapy intervention demonstrated small-to-moderate clinically meaningful improvements in anxiety, depression, and quality of life during radiotherapy, with effects persisting through 6-month follow-up. Implementation into routine radiotherapy care of breast cancer patients in China appears feasible and effective."

    "abstract": "Lip squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) accounts for approximately 30% of oral malignancies. Delayed diagnosis worsens the prognosis, leading to tumor growth, regional lymph node involvement, distant metastasis, and the need for invasive therapy. Dermoscopy is a practical, low-cost, and non-invasive diagnostic tool used to detect skin tumors. This review analyzed the common dermoscopic features of lip SCC and actinic cheilitis (AC). A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science was made for original dermatoscopy studies. Pooled proportions were calculated using a random-effects model (95% CI). Eleven studies were included: 325 patients, 205 lip SCCs, and 122 ACs. Key dermoscopic findings in lip SCCs were white structureless areas 61.9%, ulceration 59.3%, white halos 57.7%, keratin scales 54.98%, pinkish-red background 50.5%, whitish-yellow colors 41.8%, and shiny white streaks 24.5%. Polymorphous vessels were found in 55.8%, and monomorphous in 44.1%. Vessel morphology was hairpin 30.90%, serpentine 22.27%, dotted 21.46%, and glomerular 11.20%. ACs exhibited white halos in 66.14% of cases, white structureless areas in 59.62%, white scales in 57.90%, yellow scales in 30.14%, ulceration in 32.43%, white circles in 9.94%, and had polymorphous (72.93%), hairpin (30.83%), or dotted (20.71%) vessels. Dermoscopy aids early detection of lip SCC and AC, though overlapping features can limit accurate distinction. Histopathological confirmation remains essential in difficult cases, and further studies should explore subgroup-specific dermoscopic patterns."

    "abstract": "This review is part of a special memorial issue in honor of Erich Sackmann's remarkable research career, in particular, on the biophysics of equilibrium and living membranes. Erich's large body of discoveries firmly established him as a giant in the field of biophysics. In our review, we describe structural studies of microtubules (MTs) in the presence of the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau, an intrinsically disordered protein confined to the axon of mature neurons in vertebrates. We start with a brief review of experiments where the inherently dynamical MT is fixed with the cancer chemotherapy drug molecule paclitaxel (PTX). At a PTX to tubulin-dimer molar ratio of 1, tau is found to modulate the protofilament number of MTs with a tendency to increase the MT diameter. Under these high paclitaxel/tubulin molar ratios, where a vast amount of comprehensive literature on the high-resolution structure of tubulin and MTs exists, tau does not mediate bundling interactions between MTs. The review further describes more recent structural studies, which combine synchrotron small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) with electron microscopy of plastic embedded preparations. The studies, focus on elucidating the steady-state assembled structures emerging from reaction mixtures of tubulin, tau, and GTP at 37 degrees C, all in the absence of paclitaxel. The mixtures contained either no added magnesium (aside from the 1 mM Mg(2+) present in the buffer), or up to a few mM of Mg(2+) comparable to cellular concentrations are intended to provide samples for studies to clarify the effects of cellular metal ions on tubulin/tau assemblies. The combined paclitaxel-free studies represent a minimal cell free model of the MT cytoskeleton found in the central core of the axon initial segment (AIS) of mature neurons. SAXS and TEM revealed out-of-equilibrium steady-state structures with hexagonal and linear symmetries (in cross-section), and large MT wall-to-wall spacing greater than the diameter of MTs. The spacings and linear MT architecture resemble the morphology of MT fascicles found in the AIS. SAXS of reaction mixtures combined with TEM imaging of plastic embedded samples provided evidence that microtubules are bundled and stabilized by an intervening network of complexes of tubulin oligomers and tau."

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the fourth most commonly diagnosed malignancy worldwide and remains a major clinical challenge due to its heterogeneous course and lack of reliable prognostic biomarkers. Mitochondrial ribosomal protein L23 (MRPL23) has recently emerged as a potential contributor to cancer progression, but its role in prostate cancer remains poorly understood. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from 67 PCa patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were analyzed. MRPL23 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry using a semi-quantitative immunoreactive scale (IRS). Clinicopathological data were collected for correlation analysis. Survival outcomes were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models. MRPL23 expression differed significantly across all tissue types, with higher levels in prostate cancer tissues compared with normal epithelium, and the highest expression observed in lymph node metastases (P < .001). High MRPL23 expression was associated with shorter overall survival (P = .003) and remained an independent prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis (HR 3.99, 95% CI 1.63-9.77, P = .002). Complementary TCGA analysis confirmed elevated MRPL23 mRNA levels in prostate adenocarcinomas compared with normal tissues (P = .01) and demonstrated that high expression predicted shorter disease-free survival (10-year DFS: 75.98% versus 92.92%, log-rank P = .01). MRPL23 is a potential prognostic biomarker in prostate cancer, linked to aggressive tumor behavior and poor outcomes. Its expression in metastatic tissue suggests a role in disease progression, while TCGA data confirm its prognostic value for recurrence risk. MRPL23 may also serve as a therapeutic target in advanced PCa."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma (NB) is a childhood cancer of the sympathetic nervous system, and its prognosis is poor. NB cells undergo transcriptional changes to utilise aerobic glycolysis as their primary metabolic pathway, which provides an immediate source of ATP to meet high biosynthetic demands. Alternative metabolic fuel inputs, including ketone bodies which require oxidative phosphorylation, may impact the proliferative capacity of NB. AIMS: In this exploratory study, the expression of glycolytic and ketolytic genes in the context of MYCN oncogene amplification, tumour staging 1-4 and Kaplan-Meier survivability was investigated using the R2: Genomics analysis and visualisation platform (http://r2.amc.nl), database. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three NB genomics datasets were assessed in the R2 platform and further analysed in GraphPad Prism to investigate the relationships between glycolytic and ketolytic gene expression and prognosis. Glycolytic gene expression is increased in MYCN amplified, metastatic tumours and is associated with worse event free survival. Ketolytic gene expression is lower in metastatic tumours and is associated with better event free survivability. The glycolytic gene expression profile of NB suggests that elevated levels correlate with a low probability of survival. Ketolytic gene expression patterns suggest a decreased reliance for ketolytic energy, which may be exploited to slow tumourigenic growth. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates glycolytic and ketolytic gene expression profiles in metastatic and MYCN amplified NB tumours and through conditional analysis suggests the potential use of these genes in prognosis prediction. Furthermore, the study highlights the reliability and utility of genomic databases as oncogenomic tools for NB research."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer; however, the mechanisms driving metabolic heterogeneity across diverse cell types in the tumor microenvironment remain poorly understood. Most existing methods predict metabolic states at the pathway level but rarely map reaction-level alterations to their upstream regulators, thereby constraining both interpretability and translational relevance. METHODS: We developed MetroSCREEN, a reference-guided computational framework that infers reaction-level metabolic flux propensity and nominates upstream regulators from bulk and single-cell transcriptomes. MetroSCREEN uses a fast enrichment-based procedure to quantify reaction-level metabolic activity. To characterize metabolic regulons, it integrates intrinsic gene-regulatory signals with extrinsic cell-cell interaction cues, then applies a robust multi-evidence ranking scheme to combine these information sources, and finally employs a constraint-based causal discovery module to infer regulatory directionality. RESULTS: MetroSCREEN accurately predicts reaction-level metabolic activities and their upstream regulators, as demonstrated using paired transcriptomic-metabolomic datasets from the cancer cell lines. We further validated predicted regulators with in-house single-cell CRISPR screens in PC9 cells targeting metabolic regulators. Applying MetroSCREEN to a pan-cancer single-cell atlas of more than 700,000 fibroblasts and myeloid cells across 36 cancer types, we identified ZNF281 and STAT1 as key regulators of collagen metabolism, which is elevated in extracellular-matrix-associated fibroblasts and macrophages at tumor margins. By contrast, APOE and KLF7 regulate sphingolipid metabolism and antigen presentation in macrophages. Leveraging extensive tumor profiles, MetroSCREEN also delineates metabolic subtypes and regulators associated with patient survival and response to immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: MetroSCREEN is a robust and scalable approach for characterizing metabolic heterogeneity and pinpointing metabolic regulators at single-cell resolution, unveiling novel antitumor targets for future metabolic interventions. The source codes of MetroSCREEN is available at the Github site https://github.com/wanglabtongji/MetroSCREEN ."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology, with pulmonary involvement being the most common and clinically significant manifestation. Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) plays a key role in leukocyte trafficking to inflamed tissues. [(6)(8)Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 is a novel PET radiotracer that binds to VAP-1. This proof-of-concept study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of [(68)Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 PET/CT for imaging pulmonary sarcoidosis. METHODS: Six patients with stage 2 pulmonary sarcoidosis (age 50.5 +/- 13.1 years; bodyweight 84.2 +/- 14.7 kg), diagnosed by clinical, radiological, and histological findings, underwent [(68)Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 PET/CT. Control subjects included six healthy male volunteers (age 37.5 +/- 10.3 years; bodyweight 80.3 +/- 3.9 kg) and one female patient with lung cancer (age 77 years; bodyweight 62 kg). Tracer uptake was quantified in the lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes, and organs involved in systemic inflammation. RESULTS: Patients with sarcoidosis showed significantly higher [(68)Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 uptake in the lungs (SUV(mean) 1.82 +/- 0.52 vs. 0.41 +/- 0.08; P = 0.00006) and mediastinal lymph nodes (SUV(mean) 2.06 +/- 0.46 vs. 0.89 +/- 0.26; P = 0.0003) compared to healthy controls. Increased uptake was also observed in the liver (SUV(mean) 1.18 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.80 +/- 0.10, P = 0.0003), spleen (SUV(mean) 1.13 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.82 +/- 0.06, P = 0.00003), bone marrow (SUV(mean) 0.30 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.06 +/- 0.05, P = 0.001), and bone (SUV(mean) 0.27 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.08 +/- 0.04, P = 0.004), indicating systemic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the potential of VAP-1-targeted [(68)Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 PET/CT for imaging pulmonary sarcoidosis and associated inflammatory activity. Further validation in larger cohorts are warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03755245 (registered 27 November 2018), NCT05212103 (registered 27 January 2022)."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality among incarcerated populations globally, yet research on cancer characteristics and outcomes in this vulnerable group remains limited. The purpose of this study is to compare sociodemographic factors, main tumor characteristics, treatment modalities, and survival rates between cancer patients managed within a prison hospitalization unit (PHU) and those treated in a community hospital. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, comparing 63 cancer patients from the PHU with 129 matched controls from the general population, matched by tumor type and age. Sociodemographic variables, risk factors, tumor types, treatment and survival were analyzed. Chi-square tests and Student's t tests were used for group comparisons, and Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank tests were applied for survival analysis. The statistical significance level considered was 5% (SPSS v29). RESULTS: The prison population had a higher prevalence of smoking (74.6% vs. 60.5%), alcohol consumption (50.8% vs. 36.4%), and other substance use (25.4% vs. 14.7%) (p < 0.001). The most common types of tumors were gastrointestinal (12%), prostate (9%), and head and neck (9%). Survival was lower for head/neck cancer patients in the PHU and higher in lung cancer patients (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Incarcerated cancer patients presented a higher prevalence of risk factors but received similar oncological treatments compared to community controls. Survival was poorer for head and neck cancers and unexpectedly better for lung cancer, although these findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size. The integrated prison-hospital model may reduce treatment disparities, but barriers to early diagnosis and follow-up remain."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a leading cause of cardiovascular-related mortality worldwide, with a growing burden among cancer patients due to shared risk factors and treatment-related Cardiotoxicity. However, nationwide trends and disparities in IHD-related mortality among cancer patients remain unexplored. METHODOLOGY: This study utilized CDC WONDER mortality data from 1999 to 2020, identifying U.S. adults (>/= 25 years) with cancer (ICD-10: C00-D48) who died from chronic IHD (ICD-10: I25) as the underlying cause. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) and annual percent changes (APCs) were calculated and stratified by gender, age, race, geographic region, and urbanization level. RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2020, there were 246,664 Chronic IHD-related deaths among adult cancer patients. The AAMR declined significantly from 8.44 per 100,000 in 1999 to 3.71 in 2020. A steady decline occurred from 1999 to 2018 (APC: -3.85%; 95% CI: -4.01 to -3.72), followed by a slight increase from 2018 to 2020 (APC: 2.92%; 95% CI: 0.33 to 4.70). Men had higher AAMRs than women (8.16 vs. 3.25). The highest CMR were observed in older adults (24.19), with significantly lower rates in middle-aged (1.26) and young adults (0.04). Racial disparities revealed the highest AAMRs in non-Hispanic Black individuals (5.64), followed by non-Hispanic Whites (5.37), NH American Indian (3.59), Hispanics (3.28), and NH Asians (2.7). Geographic trends showed that the Northeast had the highest AAMRs (6.88), while urban areas had slightly higher mortality than rural areas (5.23 vs. 5.06). CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide analysis highlights a significant decline in chronic IHD-related mortality among cancer patients, with persistent disparities by gender, age, race, and geographic location. The recent rise in AAMRs after 2018 suggests emerging risk factors that warrant further investigation. Addressing these disparities through targeted cardiovascular risk management in cancer patients is crucial to improving long-term outcomes."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dedifferentiated (DC) and poorly differentiated chordomas (PDC) are rare, aggressive chordomas with a significantly worse prognosis than conventional chordomas (CC). The molecular mechanisms driving them remain poorly understood. METHODS: Matched primary CC and recurrent DC cryopreserved samples from one patient were analyzed with whole-exome sequencing (WES). Samples from three additional DCs and one PDC underwent targeted sequencing of cancer-related genes. Furthermore, 102 CC cases - 32 novel and 70 from literature, were analyzed. Functional and survival analysis was performed. RESULTS: WES revealed striking genomic changes during progression from CC to DC, with the number of somatic mutations increasing from 211 in primary to 430 in the recurrent DC; recurrence acquired TP53 and BRCA1 deleterious mutations, along with copy-number alterations, including loss of 6q containing the TBXT locus. Targeted sequencing identified TP53 mutations in 4/5 DC&PDC cases compared to 1/102 cases in combined CC cohorts (p = 2.7x10(-5), OR=162.9). In 3 recurrent DC samples with TP53 variant, presence of the mutation was assessed in primary CC sample and in neither, this variant was found. Literature review revealed TP53 mutations in 9/23 (39%) DC&PDC cases versus 5/445 (1.24%) CC cases. Survival analysis demonstrated that TP53 mutations confer a significantly worse prognosis in DC patients (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: TP53 mutations are acquired during chordoma progression and are associated with an aggressive phenotype; TP53 sequencing could serve as a prognostic and potentially predictive biomarker in aggressive chordomas."

    "abstract": "Cisplatin resistance remains a major challenge in the clinical treatment of bladder cancer (BC), and the epigenetic regulation of this resistance, particularly involving 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the role of 5hmC and vitamin C (VC) in modulating cisplatin sensitivity in BC. Clinical analyses of 36 BC patients receiving cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed that reduced 5hmC levels in pre-chemotherapy tumor tissues were significantly associated with cisplatin resistance (CR-BC) and poor prognosis, with low 5hmC correlating with shorter progression-free survival (PFS). In vitro, we established two cisplatin-resistant cell lines (T24-CR, UMUC-3-CR) that exhibited reduced 5hmC compared to parental cells. Treatment with 100 muM VC significantly restored 5hmC levels in CR-BC cells by activating TET enzymes, inhibited cell proliferation, and enhanced cisplatin sensitivity; these effects were abrogated by the TET inhibitor Bobcat339, confirming VC acts in a TET-dependent manner. Mechanistically, genome-wide 850 K methylation array and RNA-seq analyses revealed that VC upregulated methylation specifically at the promoter of ATF4, a downstream effector of the MAPK pathway, thereby downregulating ATF4 expression. ATF4 knockdown in CR-BC cells increasing cisplatin sensitivity, while Bobcat339 reversed VC-induced ATF4 downregulation. In vivo, VC combined with cisplatin significantly inhibited tumor growth in T24-CR xenografts, and co-treatment with ATF4 knockdown further enhanced this effect, accompanied by elevated 5hmC and reduced Ki67 in tumors. Collectively, our findings identify reduced 5hmC as a hallmark of cisplatin-resistant BC and reveal a novel mechanism by which VC enhances cisplatin sensitivity. VC activates TET enzymes to increase 5mC at the ATF4 promoter, downregulating ATF4 and modulating the MAPK pathway. This highlights VC as a potential epigenetic adjuvant to overcome cisplatin resistance in BC."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer reduces quality of life. Hr-QoL after all types of surgeries in general and after elective breast surgeries like mastectomy in particular is, however an under-researched area worldwide. This gap is conspicuously felt and seen especially in developing countries like Ethiopia. The main objective of this study was to assess the Hr-QoL outcomes of breast cancer cases after curative-intent surgery in comparison with health institution-based normal individuals. METHODS AND PATIENTS: A comparative cross-sectional study using SF-36 was conducted to compare Hr-QoL outcomes of representatively sampled 366 post-mastectomy women and health institution-based women as controls. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS windows version 21. The mean ranks of the Hr-QoL outcomes on a 0 to 100 scale were compared between the two groups using Mann-Whitney U test at p-value </= 0.05 (two-sided). RESULTS: Three hundred sixty-six participants (366), 183 cases and 183 controls were included in the analysis. Post-mastectomy cases had a median Physical Functioning (PF) of 70.0; Role-Physical (RP) of 75.0; Bodily Pain (BP) of 44.0; General Health (GH) of 35.0; Vitality (VT) of 40.0; Social Functioning (SF) of 50.0; Role-Emotional (RE) of 33.3; and Mental Health (MH) of 44.0. The respective values for the control group were: 75.0; 75.0; 54.0; 50.0; 55.0; 62.5; 66.7; and 64.0. PF and RP showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups. On the other hand, BP, GH, VT, SF, RE and MH were significantly lower in the post-mastectomy group. CONCLUSION: Quality of life of breast cancer patients after a curative-intent mastectomy was found to be lower. They had significantly lower scores in scales measuring mental health and those measuring both physical and mental health. Of the three scales assessing physical health, bodily pain was significantly lower."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colectomy for colon cancer typically results in gastrointestinal hypomotility. Daikenchuto, a herbal medicine traditionally used in Japan, is administered to alleviate gastrointestinal hypomotility. However, it is suspected to cause hepatobiliary injury. Therefore, in this comparative, retrospective cohort study, we aimed to assess the risk of daikenchuto administration-induced hepatobiliary injury post-colectomy. METHODS: Patients with colon cancer who underwent colectomy, excluding the population with a high risk of postoperative hepatobiliary injury, were included in this study (N = 17,996). Specifically, patients who received daikenchuto within 4 days after colectomy or from the day of surgery to the first meal postoperatively and those who did not receive daikenchuto were assigned to the daikenchuto exposure and non-exposure groups, respectively. The primary outcome was the postoperative administration of cholagogues or hepatoprotective drugs. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed considering the perioperative risk factors for hepatobiliary injury. The analysis estimated the adjusted odds ratios to assess the risk of daikenchuto-induced hepatobiliary injury. RESULTS: The frequencies of the postoperative administration of cholagogues or hepatoprotective drugs were 52 of 2,324 patients (2.24%) and 421 of 15,672 (2.69%) in the daikenchuto exposure and non-exposure groups, respectively. Furthermore, the adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (0.62-1.12) were < 1 and included 1, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: No association between daikenchuto and the risk of hepatobiliary injury was identified. Thus, our results imply that daikenchuto can be safely administered post-colectomy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered in the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (Trial ID: jRCT1031240102; https://jrct.mhlw.go.jp/en-latest-detail/jRCT1031240102 ) on May 22, 2024."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer (CC) is a public health burden, particularly in low-and middle-income countries, but can be prevented by screening for Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Nevertheless, positive test results may have psychological and sexual impacts for women. This study aimed to assess the impact of HPV test results on anxiety and sexual dysfunction in Cameroonian women. METHODS: This prospective cohort study conducted from 2020 to 2022 in Cameroon, included women previously enrolled in the 3T-Approach trial. Participants underwent a same-day consultation, organized as follows: HPV screening, triage of HPV-positive women and treatment by thermal ablation or Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone (LLETZ), if necessary. They completed anxiety (STAI) and sexual function (ASEX) questionnaires at 1, 6, and 12 months post-screening. RESULTS: Among 273 women included in the study, 220 (80.6%) completed all time points. Upon inclusion, 24.5% were HPV-positive, of which 46.3% underwent treatment. Anxiety levels did not significantly differ by HPV status. Higher sexual dysfunction prevalence was observed in HPV-positive women at all intervals. Between 1 and 12 months HPV-positive women showed an increase in their mean sexual dysfunction score (+ 4.5, 95% CI: 0.5 to 8.4), which was not seen in HPV-negative women. This disparity persisted even after adjusting for socio-demographic factors. CONCLUSION: HPV test results did not significantly impact anxiety levels in women in Cameroon. Nevertheless, HPV-positive women reported higher sexual dysfunction at one-year post-screening compared to HPV-negative women. Further research should focus on investigating the factors affecting sexual dysfunction, in order to propose strategies to maintain women's well-being without compromising screening rates. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The protocol of the 3TApproach study was registered under ClinicalTrials.gov, (identifier NCT03757299) on 28, November, 2018."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of Mepitel film on the prevention and treatment of radiodermatitis. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search across multiple databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, and SinoMed Database, from their inception until August 6, 2024. We identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials that assessed the effects of Mepitel film on radiodermatitis. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool for randomized trials (RoB2). Traditional meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 and Stata 14.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies involving 2,313 cancer patients were included. The pooled analysis indicated that Mepitel significantly reduced the incidence of radiation dermatitis (OR = 0.28, 95%CI 0.16 to 0.50, I(2) = 67%, P < 0.0001) compared to the control groups. In the subgroup analysis by cancer type, Mepitel reduced the incidence of radiation dermatitis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (OR = 0.25, 95%CI 0.13 to 0.46, I(2) = 0%, P < 0.0001), breast cancer (OR = 0.42, 95%CI 0.26 to 0.68, I(2) = 24%, P = 0.0004), and various malignancies (OR = 0.10, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.16, I(2) = 0%, P < 0.00001). Mepitel use was also associated with a lower incidence of moderate and severe skin injury in radiotherapy patients (RTOG grade II OR = 0.26, 95%CI 0.16 to 0.42, P < 0.00001; RTOG grade III OR = 0.19, 95%CI 0.12 to 0.30, P < 0.00001; RTOG grade IV OR = 0.10, 95%CI 0.03 to 0.36, P = 0.0005), as well as a reduction in the severity of radiation-induced skin damage (combined RISRAS score, MD= -0.74 95% CI -1.02 to -0.46, I(2) = 95%, P < 0.00001; researcher RISRAS score MD= -0.47 95% CI -0.67 to -0.27, I(2) = 90%, P < 0.00001; and patient RISRAS score MD= -1.19 95% CI -1.33 to -1.05, I(2) = 39%, P < 0.00001). Additionally, patients treated with Mepitel experienced fewer cases of moist desquamation (OR = 0.46, 95%CI 0.25 to 0.83, I(2) = 58%, P = 0.010), and shorter healing times (MD= -4.73, 95%CI -7.16 to -2.30, I(2) = 98%, P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Mepitel interventions significantly reduced RTOG grades and RISRAS scores, decreased the risk of moist desquamation, and shortened healing times for radiation-induced dermatitis in cancer patients. Further clinical studies are needed to better understand the relationship between Mepitel and radiation dermatitis in this patient population."

The purpose of the meta-analysis was to comprehensively evaluate the association between creatinine/cystatin C ratio(CCR) or sarcopenia index(SI) and survival outcomes in cancer patients with sarcopenia. METHODS: A comprehensive search of relevant studies was implemented by scrutinizing Pubmed, Web of science and Embase databases until June 30, 2024. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the survival outcomes. RESULTS: 18 studies from 17 articles involving 9908 patients were enrolled in the study. The meta-analysis indicated that low CCR was significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS) (HR:1.71,95% CI: 1.42-2.06), progression free survival (PFS)((HR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.33-2.34), recurrence free survival (RFS)(HR: 2.48; 95% CI: 1.52-4.05). Low SI was correlated with poor OS (HR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.21-2.13). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that low CCR was an adverse prognostic marker not affected by cancer type, treatment method, country and analysis type. CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia assessed by CCR or SI predicted unfavorable prognosis in cancer patients. CCR or SI can be used as an effective and convenient indicator of sarcopenia in cancer patients."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To establish a model integrates clinical, traditional radiologic, intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics (ITR and PTR), and intratumoral and peritumoral heterogeneity (ITH and PTH) features to diagnose lymphovascular invasion (LVI) status for early stage non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data and chest CT imaging data of NSCLC patients who underwent surgical resection of the lungs from January 2019 to May 2021 were collected. Surgical pathology were the diagnostic gold standard to clarify the LVI status. ITR and PTR features and ITH and PTH features from the total tumor volume and peritumoral tumor volume were extracted. Then clinical, traditional radiologic, ITR and PTR, ITH and PTH models were established to diagnose LVI status. Finally, a column chart diagnostic model was constructed and the diagnostic efficacy was evaluated. RESULTS: 366 NSCLC patients were enrolled in this retrospective study from 2 institutions, in which Institution 1 served as the basis for training (n = 154) and internal validation (n = 154) sets, while Institution 2 served as the external validation set (n = 58). In the three cohorts of PTR_(0-3, -3-3 and 0-6), the PTR_0-6 model has better predictive performance, with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.882 and 0.824 for the training and validation groups, respectively. Gender, Vascular Convergence Sign, and N stage were significantly related to LVI status, Finally, the combined model integrated ITH, PTR_0-6, and PTH_0-6 models, N stage and Vascular Convergence Sign has the highest diagnostic accuracy. The AUCs for training set, internal validation set, and external validation set were 0.963, 0.882, and 0.743, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive diagnostic model based on clinical features, traditional radiological features, radiomic features, and heterogeneity features of NSCLC were established to diagnose LVI for early stage NSCLC, which has the highest diagnostic efficiency and can help to guide treatment decisions.

    "abstract": "The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) is a component of a ubiquitin ligase complex that controls cellular responses to hypoxia. Endogenous VHL is also utilized by proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) protein degraders, a promising class of anti-cancer agents. VHL is broadly essential for cell proliferation, yet it is a key tumor suppressor in renal cell carcinoma. To understand the functional consequences of VHL loss, and to identify targeted approaches for the elimination of VHL null cells, we have used genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening in human renal epithelial cells. We find that, upon VHL loss, the HIF1A/ARNT complex is the central inhibitor of cellular fitness, suppressing mitochondrial respiration, and that VHL null cells show HIF1A-dependent molecular vulnerabilities that can be targeted pharmacologically. Combined VHL/HIF1A inactivation in breast and esophageal cancer cells can also provide resistance to ARV-771, a VHL-based bromodomain degrader that has anti-cancer activity. HIF1A stabilization can thus provide opportunities for early intervention in neoplastic VHL clones, and the VHL-HIF1A axis may be relevant for the development of resistance to the emerging class of PROTAC-based cancer therapies."

As the two identified metal ion-based regulated cell death forms, ferroptosis and cuproptosis were initially studied separately, while increasing evidences underscored their intricate connections. Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most severe malignant tumors of the digestive system. Targeting the complex interplay between ferroptosis and cuproptosis, and understanding their intrinsic mechanisms may offer approaches for developing innovative therapies in GC. Here, we identified that metal-regulatory transcription factor 1 (MTF1) was the key gene blocking the sensitivity of ferroptosis and cuproptosis enhanced by the combination treatment with FINO2 and ES-Cu in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MTF1 suppressed FINO2/ES-Cu induced ferroptosis through upregulating FTH1 to reduce Fe(2+) levels. In addition to direct transcriptional upregulation of FTH1, MTF1 activated TRIM31. Subsequently, TRIM31 catalyzed ubiquitination of NCOA4 and also promoted the expression of FTH1. On the other hand, it also activated iron-sulfur cluster assembly 2 (ISCA2)-mediated iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly and iron starvation response to inhibit cuproptosis and ferroptosis. Collectively, our findings indicated the mechanism of the synergistic effect of ferroptosis and cuproptosis in the treatment of GC and presented a prospective therapeutic strategy through elucidating the molecular mechanism of ferroptosis and cuproptosis mediated by MTF1."

    "abstract": "Cell migration is a cornerstone of biological systems, enabling organisms to adapt to environmental stimuli and maintain homeostasis. Disruptions in this process can lead to functional impairment or system failure. In many cases, cells do not move randomly; instead, they migrate directionally in response to external cues, allowing them to perform essential biological functions. This directed movement is especially important in processes such as morphogenesis, cancer invasion, and wound healing. To unravel the complexities of directional cell migration, investigating natural guiding stimuli is crucial. Among these, electrical fields stand out as precise and physiologically relevant stimulus. Using a platform designed to apply programmable electric fields, the SCHEEPDOG device, we applied controlled electric field of varying intensities to keratocytes and quantitatively analyzed their migratory behavior. Our findings reveal that electric field stimulation not only induces robust directional migration but also enhances migration speed in an intensity-dependent manner. Additionally, cells initially moving in random directions gradually align with the field vector, with higher intensities accelerating the alignment. Intriguingly, while both speed and alignment time can be modulated through stimulation, the overall shape of migration trajectories remains unchanged. In other terms, for cells initially moving to the opposite direction of the field, the alignment is accompanied by making a turn and the size and shape of this turn are not affected by the magnitude of the electrical stimulation. Together, these results demonstrate that electrical stimulation can tune the speed and directional alignment of keratocyte migration without altering turning dynamics. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of electrotaxis and offers new insights into how biophysical cues regulate cell migration in both physiological and pathological contexts."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large group of anthropogenic chemicals that have been widely used in industrial manufacturing for decades. Due to their persistence in both the biotic and abiotic environment over many years, PFAS are also referred to as \"forever chemicals.\" Some PFAS exhibit toxic properties and can harm both the environment and human health. OBJECTIVE: To describe the chemical properties, adverse health effects, and main exposure sources of PFAS, with a particular focus on the skin and inflammatory skin diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An unrestricted literature search was conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar to prepare a narrative review. The search terms included the following: atopic dermatitis, cutaneous, forever chemicals, PFAS, PFOA, psoriasis, skin, skin cancer, skin disease. RESULTS: Human skin exposure to PFAS occurs either through direct contact with contaminated cosmetics, personal care products, and textiles, or indirectly through the redistribution of systemically absorbed PFAS. Depending on the specific PFAS compound, as well as the duration and level of exposure, these substances can suppress cutaneous immune responses, induce oxidative stress, and trigger proinflammatory tissue reactions. Epidemiological studies have shown an association between PFAS exposure and atopic dermatitis, particularly among female study participants. CONCLUSION: The currently available epidemiological and experimental evidence regarding the effects of PFAS on skin health remains limited in scope and strength. Given the near-ubiquitous presence of PFAS in the environment, further research is urgently needed to better understand the associated risks to the skin and to develop targeted preventive strategies."

However, a comprehensive bibliometric overview of CAFs in HCC is lacking. METHODS: A systematic search of the Web of Science Core Collection from January 1, 2004, to June 15, 2025 yielded 646 eligible publications. Bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer and CiteSpace mapped publication trends, international collaboration, institutional contributions, author networks, journal impact, and research hotspots. RESULTS: A total of 646 articles were analyzed, spanning 282 journals and 2684 keywords. From 2004 to June 15, 2025, there was a significant increase in publications. China led in publication numbers, followed by the US and Japan. Renowned institutions include Sun Yat Sen University, Fudan University, and Zhejiang University. Notable researchers are Fan Jia, Giannelli Gianluigi, and Zhou Jian. The journal with the highest publication and citation frequency is Cancer Research. The main research focuses are the effects of CAFs on HCC cell proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis, immunosuppression, and drug resistance, as well as the mechanisms of CAFs in HCC immunotherapy and the progress in targeted CAF research. CONCLUSION: CAFs research in HCC has transitioned from descriptive studies to precision therapeutic targeting. Future directions involve dissecting CAFs plasticity, leveraging single-cell multiomics, and optimizing combination therapies to overcome TME-mediated resistance."

    "abstract": "FLIM (Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy) is a powerful technique used to study protein-protein interactions, enzyme kinetics dynamics, and cellular metabolism. It is also used in studying diseases like cancer, where changes in fluorescence lifetimes can indicate alterations in cellular physiology of malignancies. Recently, FLIM technology in fluorescence guidance has been applied in receptor-targeted clinical applications. Here, we propose the application of FLIM in two animal models of esophageal adenocarcinoma, xenograft and orthotopic with a HER-2 targeting probe (Nanofitin-IRDye800CW, NF-800 hereafter) previously developed. Moreover, the technique was used to further investigate the determinants of lifetime during probe-receptor interactions. The presented data indicates that FLIM is a powerful technique and, when coupled with NF-800, it could enhance tumor contrast, leading to new clinical applications in fluorescence guided surgery."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A previously conducted study reported that insomnia rates among oncology patients in Ireland are twice that of the general population, and that a breast cancer diagnosis was an independent predictor for clinical insomnia disorder. The aim of this study is to explore this interaction further in a larger cohort of breast cancer patients. METHODS: We evaluated sleep disturbance and sleep hygiene practices among adult breast cancer patients via questionnaires. Sociodemographic data, clinical characteristics, sleep history and attitudes towards sleep assessments were collected and analysed. RESULTS: The comprehensive 40-item questionnaire was completed by 315 patients. Of this cohort, 56% reported a change in their sleeping patterns since their cancer diagnosis, with over 55% of the study population having sub-threshold or clinical insomnia disorder. Although 64.2% of patients believed that questions regarding sleep should be part of breast cancer assessment, only 32% recalled being asked about sleep by a healthcare worker. Moreover, only 27.1% of respondents felt their sleeping difficulties were adequately dealt with since their diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In summary, sleep disturbance is prevalent among breast cancer patients. Despite a majority of breast cancer patients recognising the importance of sleep assessment, a significant gap remains in healthcare providers addressing these concerns effectively."

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer (CC), a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide, is primarily driven by high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and comprises two major histological subtypes: adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Despite advances in prevention and treatment, the molecular and cellular heterogeneity of these subtypes poses significant challenges to achieving optimal clinical outcomes. Here, we integrate single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) to dissect the cellular and spatial heterogeneity of AC and SCC, uncovering distinct tumor microenvironment (TME) dynamics that underlie their divergent clinical behaviors. Our scRNA-seq analysis reveals that AC is enriched in epithelial cells, while SCC exhibits a more immunogenic TME with elevated plasma cells and NK/T cells. Spatial transcriptomics further highlights robust interactions between CD8 + T cells and epithelial subtypes in SCC, contrasting with the stromal-rich, immune-cold phenotype of AC. We identify subtype-specific immune and stromal features, including ICOS+ Tregs, IDO1+ cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and PLVAP+ endothelial cells, which may drive immune evasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding CC heterogeneity and offer actionable insights for developing subtype-specific therapeutic strategies, such as combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with stromal-targeting agents. This study underscores the potential of spatial multi-omics technologies to advance precision oncology and improve outcomes for cervical cancer patients."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance (IR) is increasingly recognized as a significant factor for cancer development and progression. While the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index and its derivatives (TyG-BMI (body mass index), TyG-WC (waist circumference), and TyG-WHtR (waist-to-height ratio)) have been developed as reliable and straightforward surrogate tools for reflecting IR status, their comparative associations with pan-cancer incidence and mortality remain unclear. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the associations of these four IR-related indices with pan-cancer incidence and cancer-specific mortality in a large prospective cohort. METHODS: This prospective cohort study analyzed data from 333,297 participants in the UK Biobank. The four IR-related indices mentioned above were calculated from baseline measurements. The primary outcomes were pan-cancer incidence and pan-cancer-specific mortality. Cox regression models, adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and clinical factors, were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) across participants' quartiles for each index. Besides, we assessed Dose-response relationships via restricted cubic splines (RCSs), and robustness via sensitivity and subgroup analyses. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 15.2 years, 49,695 cases of different types of cancer and 12,852 cancer-specific deaths were recorded. All four IR-related indices showed significant non-linear associations with both outcomes (p < 0.001). After full adjustment, TyG-WC demonstrated the strongest and most graded association with pan-cancer incidence, with HRs progressively increasing from Q2 to Q4 (all p < 0.05 vs. Q1), and HR of Q4 was 1.11 (95% CI (confidence interval): 1.08, 1.15, p = 0.001). For pan-cancer-specific mortality, TyG-WC (HR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.28, 1.46; p < 0.001), TyG-WHtR (HR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.18, 1.33; p < 0.001), and TyG-BMI (HR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.15,1.29; p < 0.001) were significantly elevated in Q4, with TyG-WC again showing a significant dose-response trend across all quartiles. In contrast, the original TyG index showed the weakest predictive performance. Subgroup analyses indicated effect modifications by sex, smoking status, and comorbidities. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the associations, particularly for TyG-WC. CONCLUSION: IR-related indices, especially TyG-WC, are significantly associated with both pan-cancer incidence and cancer-specific mortality. Compared with TyG, TyG-BMI, and TyG-WHtR, TyG-WC demonstrated stronger associations, suggesting its potential utility for stratifying cancer risk and prognosis in clinical and public health settings."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) induced by interferons play a crucial role in inflammatory signaling. This study aimed to investigate their anti-cancer properties in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). METHOD: Seven GBPs genes were obtained from the TCGA-LUAD and GSE31210 datasets. The GBPs score was computed for each patient using ssGSEA, followed by conducting WGCNA. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with the Limma package, and further refined by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses to develop a risk score model. Kaplan-Meier survival and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed with the survminer and timeROC packages, respectively. Immune microenvironment was profiled using ESTIMATE and ssGSEA algorithms, while the pRRophetic package was applied to predict chemotherapeutic sensitivity. Relevant signaling pathways were identified by GSEA. Finally, the functional roles of key genes were experimentally validated using CCK-8, wound healing, and Transwell assays. RESULTS: The GBPs score was significantly higher in para-carcinoma tissues. The green-yellow module (beta = 7), which contained 422 genes, was closely associated with the GBPs score. Intersection of this module with the DEGs yielded 92 overlapping candidates. A 4-gene risk model constructed from Cox regression demonstrated high predictive accuracy for 1-, 3-, and 5 year Overall Survival. Patients were assigned by the median risk score into low- and high-risk groups, with low-risk patients showing better prognostic outcomes and higher immune infiltration scores, particularly of CD4(+) T cells and activated B cells. A nomogram combining multiple clinical factors exhibited robust prognostic performance. We also further identified potential drugs for treating different risk groups of LUAD. Pathways such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Myc target V2 were enriched in high-risk groups, suggesting potential targets for immunotherapy. In vitro assays confirmed that knockdown of the model gene CBFA2T3 significantly suppressed the migratory and invasive capacities of A549 and NCI-H838 cells. CONCLUSION: We analyzed the GBPs phenotype associated with LUAD progression and developed a risk score model for patient prognosis. This finding provided a reference model for clinically assessing patient prognosis, contributing to personalized treatment for LUAD patients."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To optimize prehabilitation for patients with oesophageal cancer, insight is required into the response to prehabilitation, and factors affecting this response. This study investigated (1) the response to prehabilitation in patients with oesophageal cancer following neoadjuvant treatment, (2) the association between baseline physical fitness and preoperative changes in fitness, (3) differences in physical fitness, nutritional status, and fatigue between responders and non-responders to prehabilitation. METHODS: This multicenter cohort study included patients with oesophageal cancer, following a 6-10 week personalized prehabilitation program as part of standard care. Prehabilitation, consisting of supervised exercise and nutritional counseling, started after neoadjuvant treatment. Preoperative physical fitness and nutritional status were monitored before and after neoadjuvant treatment, and after prehabilitation. Changes over time were analyzed using linear mixed models. Impact of baseline fitness on preoperative changes in exercise capacity was investigated using a linear mixed regression model. Differences between responders to prehabilitation (> 0 Watt improvement during exercise training) and non-responders were analyzed using Independent T-Tests and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Two hundred forty patients were included (mean age 66.0 (9.3) years; 77.1% male). On average, physical fitness and nutritional status declined during neoadjuvant treatment, and significantly improved during prehabilitation. Exercise capacity increased by + 32.7 Watts (95% CI: 25.2-40.2) during prehabilitation, with similar improvements across patients with low, moderate, and high baseline capacity. Substantial heterogeneity in preoperative changes was observed, with only 49.6% of patients following a pattern of decline-improvement (corresponding to average values for exercise capacity). Sixty-five percent of patients were classified as responders. Greater decline in fitness during neoadjuvant treatment (p < .001), lower fitness after neoadjuvant treatment (p = .001), and higher fatigue (p = .01) were associated with a positive response to prehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: On average, patients with oesophageal cancer improved in physical fitness and nutritional status during prehabilitation, recovering from the impact of neoadjuvant treatment. Response to prehabilitation was independent of baseline fitness. A greater decline in fitness during neoadjuvant treatment, lower fitness before prehabilitation and higher fatigue were associated with a positive response. The heterogeneity in preoperative trajectories among patients underscores the importance of regular monitoring to tailor interventions to individual needs."

    "abstract": "Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), a common oral microorganism linked to periodontal disease, has been recently shown to play a significant role in oral and systemic health through the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Nevertheless, the implications of Porphyromonas gingivalis-derived extracellular vesicles (Pg-EVs) on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) metastasis and the corresponding underlying mechanisms continue to be shrouded in ambiguity. Our study aimed to determine whether and how Pg-EVs mediate ESCC metastasis. Using 16sRNA gene sequencing, FISH and bioinformatics we found that Pg was abundant in human ESCC cancerous tissues and was associated with poor prognosis in ESCC patients. Our results further revealed that Pg-EVs enhanced the migration and invasion of cancer cells, promoted extravasation and metastasis by inducing NFATC2 expression both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we identified that Pg-EVs induced a new pattern recognition receptor PRKACB to activate the JNK pathway, resulting in the upregulation of NFATC2.Interestingly, the abundance of Pg in tumor tissues of EC patients was positively associated with the expression levels of PRKACB and NFATC2. Moreover, high expression of PRKACB or NFATC2 was significantly associated with a shorter overall survival time of EC patients. Our findings suggest that Pg is highly prevalent in ESCC, and it is associated with poor prognosis, stage, and lymph node metastasis. As a consequence of increasing PRKACB expression, Pg-EVs activate the JNK pathway, resulting in an increase in NFATC2 expression."

This study presented a colorimetric multiplex lateral flow immunoassay strip (mLFIA) for the simultaneous detection of EpCAM and Vimentin, two representative EMT biomarkers, on heterogeneous CTCs. The assay utilized an engineered magnetic probe (pCF-Apt-H1/H2), characterized by a zwitterionic polymer coating on Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles, which conferred anti-fouling properties. This probe also incorporated dual aptamers specific for EpCAM and Vimentin for recognition, along with two complementary strands (H1/H2) that enabled fluorescent detection. Upon recognition, a cascade of strand displacement and entropy-driven amplification reactions was initiated, generating abundant single-stranded DNA co-labeled with biotin and fluorescein, which were subsequently detected by a gold nanoparticle-based mLFIA strip. Coupled with a custom-fabricated 3D-printed reader, the platform facilitated a rapid colorimetric readout for EpCAM and Vimentin, achieving low limits of detection at 0.22 and 0.16 ng/mL, respectively. Remarkably, this assay also demonstrated the capability to detect these two biomarkers on CTCs down to 10 cells/mL, and to track dynamic EMT processes. Machine learning algorithms were subsequently employed to classify and predict the colorimetric signals. Ultimately, this sensing platform proved effective in differentiating healthy individuals from colon cancer patients."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulators in cancer progression. Among them, KCNMB2 antisense RNA 1 (KCNMB2-AS1) has been identified as an oncogenic lncRNA in several tumor types; however, its role in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to elucidate the expression profile, functional significance, and underlying molecular mechanisms of KCNMB2-AS1 in ccRCC. METHODS: The expression of KCNMB2-AS1 in ccRCC tissues and cell lines was analyzed using publicly available datasets, quantitative real-time PCR, and Western blotting. Functional assays including Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, wound healing, and Transwell migration/invasion tests along with in vivo xenograft experiments were performed to assess its biological effects. Mechanistic studies, including luciferase reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and rescue assays, were conducted to verify the regulatory interactions among KCNMB2-AS1, forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3), microRNA-744-3p (miR-744-3p), and cluster of differentiation 1D (CD1D). RESULTS: KCNMB2-AS1 expression was markedly elevated in ccRCC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, and its high expression was significantly associated with advanced tumor stage, presence of distant metastasis, and poor overall survival. Silencing KCNMB2-AS1 markedly suppressed ccRCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, accompanied by reduced epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker expression. Consistent with these findings, xenograft experiments confirmed that KCNMB2-AS1 knockdown attenuated tumor growth in vivo, while its overexpression promoted aggressive tumor behavior. Mechanistically, FOXP3 directly bound to the promoter region of KCNMB2-AS1, activating its expression transcriptionally. KCNMB2-AS1 acted as a molecular sponge for miR-744-3p, thereby relieving its inhibitory effect on CD1D expression. Rescue assays demonstrated that restoring CD1D expression counteracted the inhibitory phenotypes resulting from KCNMB2-AS1 silencing. CONCLUSION: KCNMB2-AS1 serves as an oncogenic lncRNA in ccRCC, functioning through a FOXP3/KCNMB2-AS1/miR-744-3p/CD1D signaling axis, thereby revealing a novel molecular pathway that contributes to ccRCC progression."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is crucial to detect cardiotoxicity. Manual methods are time-consuming and limited by inter-reader variability, highlighting the need for precise, reproducible and rapid semi-automated digital tools in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the triplicate concatenation method (TCM) using a semi-automated ECG software (CalECG-4.2, AMPS(R)) by assessing intra- and inter-reader variabilities in two distinct cardio-oncology populations: breast cancer patients receiving ribociclib (a QT-prolonging drug) and patients admitted with severe immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI)-myocarditis, a condition marked by QRS alterations. METHODS: A total of 420 ECG from 31 patients (21 ribociclib, and 10 ICI-myocarditis) were independently analyzed by two readers. Variability was assessed using Bland-Altman analyses and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Linear mixed-effects modelling quantified time-dependent changes in heart rate (HR), PR, QTc (Fridericia's HR correction), QRS duration and voltage (Sokolow-Lyon) accounting for inter-reader variability. RESULTS: Intra and inter-reader reproducibility was excellent (ICC > 0.98, including Sokolow-Lyon voltage; standard-deviation < 4 ms across all time-derived parameters). In ribociclib-treated patients (cycles of 21/28 days on drug), QTc peaked at day 14 (16 +/- 1 ms, p < 0.001) before decreasing by day 28 (-6 +/- 1 ms, p < 0.001) compared to baseline. In ICI-myocarditis, QRS duration increased at day 5 before returning to baseline starting day 28, while Sokolow-Lyon voltages increased progressively on immunosuppressive treatments, peaking at day 28 (458 +/- 49 microV, p < 0.001) and remaining constant afterwards for the next month. CONCLUSION: TCM with CalECG-4.2 ensures a high reproducibility while monitoring key parameters like QTc duration and Sokolow-Lyon voltage, making it a reliable and time-saving alternative for the ECG surveillance of drug toxicities in cardio-oncology."

    "abstract": "RNA viruses can generate \"defective\" viral genomes during replication, which can interact with standard viral genomes affecting the course of infections. These non-standard viral genomes are related to milder clinical outcomes and are currently being tested as antivirals. Decades of research in influenza have focused on viral mechanisms affecting the production of deletion-containing viral genomes (DelVGs). Based on adaptations of influenza NS1 protein to manipulate host cell metabolism, we hypothesized host metabolic state could also alter the quantity and pattern of deletion-containing viral genomes and the particles that house them. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated host cell anabolic signaling activity and monitored the production of DelVGs and non-infectious particles by two influenza strains, using single-cell immunofluorescence and third-generation sequencing. We show that: 1) influenza infection activates PI3K signaling, with the A/H1N1 strain having roughly double the pAKT levels in single cells as the A/H3N2; 2) alpelisib, a PI3K receptor inhibitor, subverted the ability of both influenza strains to activate PI3K in a dose dependent manner; 3) DelVGs were increased roughly tenfold in polymerase complex segments and ~ 60% in the hemagglutinin segment of A/H1N1 at 20uM of alpelisib; and 4) the A/H3N2 strain did not show changes in DelVG production, but had a modest, statistically significant maximum increase of 11% in non-infectious particles. We find that host cell metabolism can increase the production of non-infectious particles and DelVGs during single rounds of infection, shifting potential interactions among virions. The differential results according to strain and alpelisib concentration suggest future directions examining strain differences in the NS1::p85beta virus-host interaction and the specific metabolic state of the cell. Our study presents a new line of investigation into metabolic states associated with less severe flu infection and opens the possibility for potential induction of these states with metabolic drugs."

This study aimed to assess serological status for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) following chemotherapy and identify factors associated with antibody loss. RESULTS: Fifty-four pediatric cancer survivors (mean age 12.5 years) were evaluated at a median of 2.5 years (IQR 1.2, 5.4) after completing chemotherapy. All participants had received at least one MMR dose before their cancer diagnosis and had completed treatment at least six months prior. Overall, 43 patients (79.6%) were seronegative for at least one MMR component. Seronegativity was highest for measles (64.8%), followed by mumps (55.6%) and rubella (35.2%). Measles seronegativity was significantly associated with a longer interval since chemotherapy (> 5 years; p = 0.04) and older age at receipt of the second MMR dose (mean 86.4 vs. 44.9 months; p = 0.002). No significant associations were observed for mumps or rubella seronegativity. These findings indicate a substantial decline in MMR immunity after chemotherapy and support the incorporation of routine post-chemotherapy revaccination into survivorship care, especially in settings where serologic testing is not readily available."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and cancer-related fatigue (CRF) are prevalent and debilitating side effects in breast cancer patients, adversely affecting treatment adherence and quality of life. Although exercise is beneficial, a standardized, practical protocol for integrating nurse-led exercise interventions into clinical pathways during chemotherapy is not yet established. METHODS: A three-round modified Delphi study was conducted between February and May 2025 among a multidisciplinary panel of 22 experts, including oncology nurses, breast oncologists, rehabilitation therapists, and patient advocates. Anonymized, structured questionnaires were administered electronically. Consensus was predefined as a mean score >/= 4.0 (on a 5-point Likert scale), agreement by >/= 75% of respondents, and standard deviation </= 1.0. Kendall's coefficient of concordance (W) was used to assess stability of rankings across rounds. RESULTS: High response rates were maintained across all rounds (100%, 95%, 100%). A strong consensus was achieved regarding 42 discrete items. Key agreements included: (1) initiating assessment and exercise prescription at the first chemotherapy cycle; (2) implementing a multi-component regimen combining aerobic, resistance, and balance training; (3) clearly defining nurses' roles in assessment, education, and monitoring; (4) personalizing exercise intensity based on daily patient-reported symptoms (e.g., fatigue); and (5) integrating digital tools for adherence support and documentation. CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes a robust expert consensus on a structured, nurse-led, personalized exercise intervention package for integration into the clinical pathway of breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The framework offers practical guidance for mitigating treatment-related side effects and improving patient outcomes. Future research should focus on evaluating its feasibility and effectiveness in diverse clinical settings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oncogenic KRAS mutations in cancer cells drive macropinocytosis, a pathway that scavenges extracellular proteins to obtain nutrients under metabolic stress. Lysosomal degradation is essential for processing these proteins, but the precise molecular link between macropinocytic uptake and lysosomal processing remains largely unclear. Aldolase A (ALDOA), a glycolytic enzyme, has diverse non-canonical functions. While interactions between ALDOA and Vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) subunits have been suggested, their functional role in lysosomal degradation of macropinocytosed cargo remains undefined. METHODS: We investigated the role of ALDOA using integrated approaches, including The Cancer Genome Atlas data analysis and in vitro assays of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines to evaluate macropinocytosis, lysosomal degradation, lysosomal pH, and interactions with V-ATPase. We also assessed mTORC1 signaling and cell proliferation under nutrient-deprived and anchorage-independent conditions. In vivo relevance was tested in xenograft tumor models. RESULTS: High expression of ALDOA correlated with a poor prognosis for patients with KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. Functionally, ALDOA selectively regulated lysosomal degradation of macropinocytosed proteins without affecting their uptake. Mechanistically, ALDOA interacted physically with V-ATPase subunits to increase lysosomal acidification, uncovering a novel, non-enzymatic role that is independent of its glycolytic function. This interaction was essential for efficient nutrient utilization, sustained mTORC1 activity, and cell proliferation under metabolic and mechanical stress. In vivo, depletion of ALDOA inhibited macropinocytosis-dependent tumor growth, phenocopying treatment with 5-(N-Ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride. CONCLUSION: Our study identifies a novel, non-enzymatic function of ALDOA as a critical regulator of lysosomal degradation of macropinocytosed proteins via interaction with V-ATPase. This mechanism is essential for metabolic adaptation and growth of KRAS-mutant tumors under stress conditions. Targeting ALDOA offers a promising therapeutic strategy for cancers that rely on extracellular nutrient scavenging."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Patients with breast cancer and brain metastasis (BCBM) have poor survival outcomes. We aim to explore predictors of survival in patients with BCBM including the Breast Graded Prognostic Assessment -GPA tool and its variables and review the impact of emerging targeted therapies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Cleveland Clinic database was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients diagnosed with BCBM between 2010 and 2020 at multiple treatment centers in Ohio and Florida. Data on demographic, clinical, and treatment variables were collected, including BC surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, HER2-targeted therapy, immunotherapy, PARP inhibitors, CDK4/6 inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), BM characteristics (number, size, location), extracranial metastasis (ECM), and BM treatments. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate median overall survival (mOS), and univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were adopted to identify significant survival predictors. RESULTS: N = 318 evaluable patients with BCBM were included. Patients were aged 46-60 years (42.5%), female (99.7%), of white race (79.6%), and non-Hispanic (97.2%). Among BC subtypes, the triple positive subgroup had the longest mOS, while the triple negative subgroup had the shortest. Having one or less ECM was linked to longer survival compared to >/= 2 ECM. Patients receiving HER2-targeted therapy, PARP inhibitors, and TKIs had significantly longer mOS than those who did not receive targeted agents. Additionally, patients who underwent BM surgery had significantly longer mOS. Patients treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) such gamma knife radiosurgery had the longest mOS among the radiotherapy subgroups. CONCLUSION: BCBM is a heterogeneous population with variable outcomes. This analysis suggests that several factors influence the development and outcome after BCBM with HR+/HER2- subgroup having the longest median time to develop BM compared to other subgroups. Survival after BCBM is impacted by age, performance status and overall disease burden, as well as the use of novel targeted therapies suggesting the feasibility to overcome the historical blood brain barrier to systemic treatment benefit from chemotherapy. Brain surgery and Radiation modalities also play an important role in improving long term outcome. These results support updating current prognostic models, such as the Breast-GPA, by integrating treatment exposures, shifting from static baseline scores to dynamic, treatment-informed prognostication."

    "abstract": "Approximately 5-10% of all cancer types are hereditary cancer syndromes, which are caused by pathogenic mutations in cancer susceptibility genes. In this investigation, a hereditary cancer pedigree was collected from a province in southern China, and the proband was a 31-year-old woman with breast cancer. Utilizing blood whole exome sequencing technology and bioinformatics analysis, the sole heterozygous missense mutation in PIBF1 that exhibits trait segregation was identified: PIBF1 (p.R405Q). The pedigree also included two other mutations that may be linked to carcinogenesis: RAD51D (p.K91Ifs*13) and BRCA2 (p.G3134Afs*29). This research concentrated on PIBF1 (p.R405Q) and employed breast cancer as a tumor model. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that PIBF1-WT suppressed breast cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, invasive ability, and tumorigenesis. However, PIBF1 (p.R405Q) attenuated or inhibited the function of PIBF1-WT. Mechanistically, PIBF1-WT resisted cisplatin-induced DNA damage, significantly down-regulated the expression of gamma-H2AX, and affected DNA damage repair, thus exerting a cancer inhibitory function. Interestingly, PIBF1 (p.R405Q) affects protein stability, thereby mitigating or eliminating the inhibitory effect of PIBF1. Furthermore, this family's polygenic risk factors for cancer are analyzed, and there is speculation about potential synergistic effects between PIBF1 and DNA damage repair genes like BRCA2 and RAD51D. In conclusion, PIBF1 regulates the cell cycle and DNA damage repair, PIBF1(p.R405Q) increases susceptibility to cancer, multiple DNA damage repair gene mutations may synergistically promote cancer progression in this cancer family lineage, and PIBF1(p.R405Q) may be one of the polygenic risk factors for familial hereditary cancer syndromes."

    "abstract": "Imagine the future where melanoma, one of the most lethal types of skin cancer, is not a frightful diagnosis anymore but a challenge met with tailored precision medicine. Despite advances, its treatment remains hindered by the triple barrier of metabolic reprogramming, immune escape, and inefficient nano-delivery. This review explores the transformative intersection of nanotechnology methodologies and precision medicine, addressing the central question: how these barriers can be overcome to achieve durable and personalized responses? Beyond summarizing current progress, it introduces the Metabolism-Immune-Nano Collaborative (MIN-C) Framework as an integrated perspective, where molecular insights, patient-specific data, and innovative nanomaterials converge to redefine care. The analysis begins by dissecting melanoma genetic and molecular complexities as a systemic disease, revealing the interplay between driver mutations, immune escape mechanisms, and the many players of the tumor microenvironment. The discussion shifts to the pivotal role of nanotechnology as a powerful ally breaking delivery barriers, amplifying immune responses, and enabling real-time monitoring of disease progression. This article proposes using the TME metabolic reprograming as a starting point for the design of nanoimmunotherapy, rather than an endpoint, complemented by precision medicine guiding decisions through biomarkers and genomic profiling, ensuring that each intervention is as unique as the patient it serves."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approximately 900,000 MRI brain scans are performed annually in the United Kingdom alone, with incidental findings frequently encountered. One of the most prevalent findings is white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). WMHs often indicate cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) but can also be associated with migraine and demyelination. Prospective population studies have already confirmed a high prevalence of WMHs in elderly patients. In younger patients, or when the radiological burden is low, WMHs are commonly considered non-specific. Routinely collected data represents a valuable resource to facilitate further study. We aimed to describe the prevalence of WMHs in a direct to scan referral population and to understand associations with age, demographics, performance status and referral criteria. METHODS: We performed a service evaluation of our local two-week wait suspected central nervous system cancer pathway to understand the association between age, demographics, performance status, referral criteria, imaging outcomes and both the prevalence and radiological characteristics of WMHs. Analysis was performed using R version 4.1.3. RESULTS: We identified 1033 patients, referred over a 30-month period. Mean patient age was 51.3+/-18.3 years with 65% females. As expected, WMHs were present on 89.7% of scans in patients aged over 80, with 98.1% of these consistent with cSVD upon review by an experienced neuroradiologist. We show an important association between WMHs deemed representative of cSVD and both performance status and levels of deprivation. However, WMHs were also present in approximately 1 in 5 patients under 50 years old and were typically deemed non-specific. Our analysis showed prevalence of WMH, its radiological burden and likelihood of WMHs being attributed to cSVD all increased with age. It is therefore feasible to consider that these changes may represent early cSVD. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a prevalence of radiological cSVD comparable to the wider literature in elderly patients whilst highlighting the potential underestimation of cSVD in the younger population, in whom further study of WMHs is required. There is potential for routinely collected data to define the prevalence and characteristics of radiological cSVD more accurately whilst facilitating further research."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a prevalent and often aggressive malignancy. While ribosome production is a critical process in numerous cancers, the role of ribosome biogenesis-related genes (RB-RGs) in PCa remains underexplored. Therefore, this study aims to examine the expression characteristics of RB-RGs as potential prognostic markers in PCa. METHODS: Transcriptomic data were obtained from public databases to pinpoint differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with PCa. Among these, DEGs that were also identified as regulatory genes were selected as candidate genes and subjected to regression analysis to determine those with prognostic significance. A prognostic risk model was then created and subjected to validation. A standalone prognostic evaluation was performed. Additionally, analyses for enrichment, immune infiltration, and drug prediction were conducted for both high- and low-risk PCa cohorts. Finally, the levels of the prognostic genes were validated through reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western Blot (WB). RESULTS: SMARCA4, FBLL1, RRS1, and NVL were selected as prognostic genes. A risk model, exhibited considerable precision in evaluating the risk of PCa. The risk score, in conjunction with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) score and Gleason score, has been recognized as independent prognostic factors for PCa. Analysis of biological pathways indicated notable variations in pathways, especially the cell cycle, when comparing the high- and low-risk groups. The expression of prognostic genes demonstrated a correlation with the presence of 21 distinct types of immune cells, notably including type-17 T helper cells, within PCa samples. Furthermore, notable variations in the levels of target genes (AKT1, CDK1, HIF1A, NFKB1, SRC, and TRIM24) were detected between the high- and low-risk cohorts in relation to different chemotherapeutic agents. PCR analysis showed that NVL and SMARCA4 were significantly upregulated in PCa samples (p < 0.05), with no significant difference in RRS 1. WB analysis showed that SMARCA4, FBLL 1, and RRS1 and NVL were differently expressed in both PCa and Control, with higher upregulation in PCa than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Among RB-RGs, SMARCA4, FBLL1, RRS1 and NVL were identified as prognostic genes for PCa, thereby providing a new direction for clinical disease treatment."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: It is unclear whether patients with breast cancer (BC) who undergo mastectomy experience delays in adjuvant treatment when bilateral surgery is performed. This study was conducted with the objective of addressing this knowledge gap. METHODS: Stage 0-III BC patients who underwent mastectomy (including conventional mastectomy, nipple-sparing mastectomy [NSM], and skin-sparing mastectomy [SSM]) at a Swiss university hospital between 01/2013 and 12/2023 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to detect predictors of time to adjuvant treatment. RESULTS: A total of 394 patients were included, 308 (78.2%) of whom underwent unilateral mastectomy (UM) and 86 (21.8%) of whom underwent bilateral mastectomy (BM). Compared with patients who underwent UM, those who underwent BM were younger (median age [years] 49 vs. 60), more likely to carry a pathogenic germline BRCA variant (28.7% vs. 2.6%), presented with bilateral breast cancer (14.9% vs. 0%), and underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (34.5% vs. 12.4%). Patients who underwent BM were more likely to receive NSM or SSM (81.4% vs. 52.9%) and to develop wound healing disorders (20.7% vs. 11.4%). On univariable analysis, no differences in time to any adjuvant treatment were observed between BMs and UMs (median [days] 34 vs. 33; p = 0.444). Multivariable analysis suggested that bilateral mastectomy was associated with a shorter time to adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.15-5.58). Short-term postoperative complications were associated with prolonged time to any adjuvant treatment (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.36-0.71) and time to adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17-0.79). CONCLUSION: Undergoing BM did not result in a delay in time to adjuvant treatment in comparison to UM."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types is a well-established risk factor for various malignancies, and timely vaccination of university students is a cost-effective strategy to reduce infection rates and the burden of HPV-associated consequences. Although many studies have examined HPV knowledge, vaccine acceptance, and uptake in university students, findings remain heterogeneous, and comprehensive quantitative synthesis is limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess global estimates of university students' knowledge of HPV and its vaccine, willingness to receive the vaccine, and actual vaccination behaviors. METHODS: The study was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) 2020 Checklist. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, China Biology Medicine disc, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wan Fang Database for studies published from January 2006 through August 2024. Studies with quality assessment scores > 5 and published in Chinese or English were included for data extraction. Pooled prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. The heterogeneity statistic I-squared and corresponding p value were also reported. RESULTS: A total of 56 studies covering 184,351 university students from four continents (Asia, Africa, Europe and North America) were included. Among students, 68.3% (95% CI 56.4%-79.0%) and 53.5% (95% CI 53.0%-54.1%) were aware of HPV and HPV vaccine, respectively, with significant gaps in knowledge about HPV symptoms, cervical cancer screening methods, and optimal vaccination timing. Pooled HPV vaccination willingness was 52.9% (95% CI 44.2%-61.6%), with higher willingness observed among females and medical students. Only 10.4% (95% CI 6.1%-15.8%) had received at least 1 dose of vaccination and 12.4% (95% CI 3.0%-26.9%) had completed the full three-dose schedule. Vaccination coverage among females was 8.6% (95% CI 3.7%-15.1%), and among medical students, 7.7% (95% CI 1.3%-18.4%). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis found that university students exhibit limited awareness of HPV and its vaccine, with about half willing to be vaccinated. Actual vaccination rates remain low and vary widely by gender, major, time of year, and geographic regions. These findings highlight the need for targeted intervention strategies, such as precision education and cross-sector collaboration, to effectively increase HPV vaccination coverage in this population."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The optimal management of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after progression on osimertinib includes cytotoxic chemotherapy. Continuing osimertinib therapy beyond progressive disease (PD) is occasionally adopted in real-world practice; however, evidence for its efficacy is limited. In this multi-institutional retrospective study, we evaluated whether osimertinib continuation beyond PD could improve survival compared with the best supportive care (BSC) in such patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with EGFR-mutated advanced or recurrent NSCLC treated with osimertinib between March 2016 and September 2025 at three Japanese community hospitals. Patients with radiological progression or intolerable adverse events after osimertinib treatment were included Patients were classified into three groups: (1) osimertinib beyond PD, (2) BSC, and (3) chemotherapy after osimertinib. Overall survival (OS) was compared among the groups using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses adjusted for time-to-treatment failure (TTF). RESULTS: Of the 309 patients treated with osimertinib, 126 met the inclusion criteria. The median age of the patients was 77 years, and 23% had poor performance status (>/= 2). Osimertinib beyond PD was administered to 21 patients (16.7%), BSC to 36 patients (28.6%), and chemotherapy to 69 patients (54.8%). The median OS after osimertinib failure was 8.8, 2.6, and 15.5 months in the beyond PD, BSC, and chemotherapy groups, respectively (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, beyond PD was associated with significantly longer OS than BSC (hazard ratio: 0.34, 95% confidence interval: 0.18-0.66, p < 0.001), even after adjusting for TTF. CONCLUSIONS: In real-world settings involving elderly and frail patients, osimertinib continuation beyond PD was associated with improved survival compared with BSC alone. Although chemotherapy remains the preferred strategy when feasible, osimertinib continuation beyond PD may represent a reasonable treatment option for patients who are ineligible for further cytotoxic therapy. In the absence of other guiding biomarkers, TTF may help clinicians identify patients most likely to benefit from continued TKI administration."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Systematic biopsy (SBx) underdetects clinically significant prostate cancer and overdiagnoses indolent disease. This study compared the transperineal cognitive fusion targeted biopsy (COG-TBx)-which uses multiparametric MRI for precision-against SBx, evaluating their cancer detection rates and safety profiles in a clinical cohort. METHODS: A total of 360 patients undergoing transperineal prostate biopsy were included, with 161 assigned to the COG-TBx group and 199 to the SBx group. Primary outcomes included PCa detection, csPCa (defined as Gleason score >/= 3 + 4 or ISUP Level >/= 2), and 30-day complication rates. Secondary outcomes comprised cancer detection rate per core and pathological characteristics. Statistical analyses involved chi(2) tests, t-tests, and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups, though prostate volume was larger in the COG-TBx group (52.0 ml vs. 46.0 ml, P = 0.024). The COG-TBx group demonstrated significantly higher PCa (52.2% vs. 41.2%, P = 0.034) and csPCa detection rates (44.7% vs. 25.6%, P < 0.05), as well as a higher cancer detection rate per needle (28.5% vs. 19.3%, P = 0.003). The overall 30-day complication rate was slightly higher in the COG-TBx group (13.0% vs. 7.0%, P > 0.05), without statistical significance. Multivariate analysis identified COG-TBx (OR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.15-3.41, P = 0.013) and PSA level (OR = 1.12 per ng/mL, 95% CI: 1.03-1.22, P = 0.008) as independent predictors of csPCa detection. CONCLUSION: Transperineal COG-TBx is associated with higher detection rates for prostate cancer and clinically significant cancer compared to SBx. Although associated with a slightly higher complication rate, the difference was not significant. The overall benefit supports the clinical adoption of COG-TBx."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers (CAYAC) present unique challenges in oncology. Advances in treatment Have led to an 80% 5-year survival rate; however, CAYAC survivors (CAYACS) remain at high risk of long-term medical and psychosocial complications, significantly impacting their quality of life. Short and long-term follow-up care is recommended, but is often fragmented, with considerable disparities in availability and accessibility across Europe. Many existing digital tools primarily address medical needs, leaving psychosocial challenges unaddressed. The e-QuoL project aims to bridge these gaps by leveraging existing digital health solutions to provide equitable, person-centered survivorship care. METHODS: The e-QuoL project employs a participatory approach involving survivors, families, healthcare professionals (HCP), and researchers. Using the FormIT methodology, the project follows three phases: Explore, Create, and Evaluate. The Explore phase includes a large-scale cross-sectional survey across 15 European countries to assess the unmet needs of CAYACS and their families. The Create phase involves co-creation workshops to develop and refine digital tools, including MyCare(e-QuoL) tool, which will supplement survivorship care passports, to provide personalized medical and psychosocial support. The Evaluate phase comprises usability testing and clinical studies in at least seven European countries to assess effectiveness, scalability, and real-world applicability. DISCUSSION: The e-QuoL project builds on existing digital health innovations while adapting them to diverse European healthcare systems. By developing MyCare(e-QuoL), the project fosters a decentralized, person-centered model of survivorship care to promote equal access to quality survivorship support for CAYACS and HCPs. Ethical considerations, including data privacy, patient consent, and equitable access, are central to the project, with dedicated Ethics and Social Challenge Groups guiding implementation. Digital disparities remain a challenge, particularly for survivors from lower socio-economic backgrounds or remote areas. To mitigate this, e-QuoL will work with healthcare professionals to offer additional in-person support to complement digital interventions. The project aligns with Europe's Beating Cancer Plan, aiming to improve quality of life and reduce disparities in care. By fostering collaboration among 30 partners across 15 countries and hosting resources on the PanCare website, e-QuoL seeks to ensure long-term impact, contributing to the goal of high-quality, equitable survivorship care across Europe."

    "abstract": "Pressurized Intraperitoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy (PIPAC) is an emerging method that delivers chemotherapeutic agents as aerosols directly into the peritoneal cavity to overcome poor tissue penetration. Although early clinical outcomes are promising, challenges remain, such as variable patient responses and the lack of appropriate preclinical models. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of PIPAC combined with three cytotoxic agents (Cisplatin, Oxaliplatin, and Paclitaxel) using patient-derived colorectal cancer organoid models. Our results demonstrates that PIPAC, especially when combined with Cisplatin, significantly enhances the cytotoxicity against colorectal cancer organoids and modulates key cancer-related pathways. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant alterations in gene expression patterns under PIPAC conditions, with notable impacts on cancer-related pathways such as epithelial-mesenchymal-transition and KRAS signaling. Pathway analysis further elucidated the modulation of cell-cycle related and oncogenic pathways by PIPAC, providing insights into its mechanism of action. These key findings suggest that PIPAC, particularly with Cisplatin, can enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy via transcriptomic modulation, supporting its potential clinical application in treating peritoneal carcinomatosis."

    "abstract": "The importance of microbiota-associated metabolites in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumorigenesis highlights the need to investigate the microbiota and metabolome along the normal-adjacent-carcinoma sequence to explore their mechanistic implications in PDAC tumorigenesis. We characterized the pancreatic microbiota and metabolome in four distinct tissue groups using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and untargeted metabolomics: tumor tissues from 23 PDAC patients (PDAC T), their matched para-carcinoma tissues (PCT), tumor tissues from 13 pancreatic benign tumor patients (Control T), and their matched non-tumor tissues (Control N). For the selected metabolites, we verified their functional activities using cell proliferation assay. From Control N, through PCT, to PDAC T, there were 90 significantly differential genera, of which seven genera increased and 65 genera decreased sequentially. Specifically, Peptostreptococcus, norank_f__Mitochondria, and Ileibacterium increased, while Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, Subdoligranulum, and Coprococcus decreased sequentially. Among altered metabolites, beta-guanidinopropionic acid (GPA), S-(2-Carboxyethyl)-L-cysteine, L-lactic acid, and 3-hydroxybutanoic acid increased, while (3Z)-2-Propylpent-3-enoic acid, linoleic acid, and monopalmitin decreased sequentially. PDAC-associated metabolites were enriched in the GABAergic synapse, butanoate metabolism, purine metabolism, and CCM in cancer pathways. GPA and S-(2-Carboxyethyl)-L-cysteine were also enriched in the chemotherapy-resistant patients compared with chemotherapy-sensitive patients, while Faecalibacterium and (3Z)-2-Propylpent-3-enoic acid were also reduced. In both PDAC tumorigenesis and chemotherapy-resistant patients, decreased Faecalibacterium was positively correlated with (3Z)-2-Propylpent-3-enoic acid, but negatively correlated with GPA and S-(2-carboxyethyl)-L-cysteine. CCK8 assays confirmed that GPA and S-(2-carboxyethyl)-L-cysteine promoted the proliferation of PDAC cell lines. GPA and S-(2-Carboxyethyl)-L-cysteine were enriched in both PDAC tumorigenesis and chemotherapy-resistant patients, while Faecalibacterium and (3Z)-2-Propylpent-3-enoic acid were reduced. GPA and S-(2-carboxyethyl)-L-cysteine could promote the proliferation of PDAC cell lines."

Here, we present SPLiCR-seq (SPLicing regulator identification through CRISPR screening), a high-throughput CRISPR screening platform that enables direct measurement of RNA splicing outcomes for pooled genetic perturbations, overcoming limitations of traditional fluorescence-based approaches. Applying SPLiCR-seq to investigate XBP1 splicing during the unfolded protein response (UPR), we conduct targeted and genome-wide screens across diverse cellular contexts, revealing both common and cell-type specific regulators. Notably, we identify GADD34 (PPP1R15A) as a novel modulator of IRE1alpha-XBP1 signaling, demonstrating that it directly interacts with IRE1alpha and functions independently of its canonical role in eIF2alpha dephosphorylation. Pharmacological inhibition of GADD34 using Sephin1 effectively suppressed XBP1 splicing and alleviated CAR-T cell exhaustion in an ex vivo model, leading to enhanced tumor-killing capacity across multiple cancer models. This work not only establishes a powerful new tool for systematically studying RNA splicing regulation but also uncovers a promising therapeutic strategy for improving CAR-T cell immunotherapy through modulation of the IRE1alpha-XBP1 pathway."

    "abstract": "There is relatively low awareness about Human papillomavirus (HPV) in Saudi Arabia. Increased awareness is required to gain better knowledge, particularly among the general population. This study aims to evaluate the awareness level of women about cervical smears, HPV, and HPV vaccine. Also, this study evaluates the effectiveness of the Saudi Ministry of Health's campaign aimed to raise awareness of HPV and the HPV vaccine by comparing data collected before and after the campaign. This study employed a cross-sectional, online survey-based design conducted in Saudi Arabia. Data were collected during two periods: 2022 and 2024. The target participants were women aged 18 and older residing in Saudi Arabia. Exclusions included individuals with a history of HPV infection and those who did not provide consent. The questionnaire comprised 26 items, organized into three sections: sociodemographic information, awareness levels of HPV and the HPV vaccine, and cervical screening practices and vaccine acceptance. A total of 858 women participated in this study. Overall, 49.4% of women were aware of HPV, and 38% were aware of the HPV vaccine. Over two-thirds (67.6%) were willing to receive a free HPV vaccination. Social media was the most common source of information (HPV: 63.2%; HPV vaccine: 57.1%). From 2022 to 2024, there was a significant increase in HPV awareness, rising from 38.8% in 2022 to 71.1% in 2024 (p < 0.001), and awareness of the HPV vaccine significantly increased from 28.2% to 58.7% (p < 0.001). Despite these improvements in awareness, only 25.8% of participants reported having undergone cervical cancer screening (Pap smear). The main drivers for awareness are knowledge-based (knowing the vaccine exists for men/children, knowing where to get it). For acceptance of HPV vaccine, the strongest psychological driver is a parent's willingness to vaccinate their children. This study highlights the success of the Saudi Ministry of Health's campaign in raising awareness about HPV and its vaccine. Despite this progress, the low uptake of cervical cancer screening remains a critical public health issue. Greater emphasis on the importance of pap smear tests is needed to enhance early detection and prevention of cervical cancer."

    "abstract": "Personalized assessment of immunocompetence and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair requires methods that are sensitive to genetic and molecular complexity beyond the well-known monogenic disorders. Inspired by decades of research using B cells to study DNA repair processes, here we present SWIBRID (SWItch junction Breakpoint Repertoire IDentification), a tool to systematically profile genomic junctions generated in vivo during antibody class switch recombination (CSR) in B cells. As CSR junctions reflect immune diversity and DNA repair proficiency, SWIBRID detects phenotypic manifestations of deficiencies via a highly scalable, blood-based PCR followed by long-read sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. We show that specific DNA repair defects, including cancer-associated mutations, exhibit distinct CSR junction patterns. Notably, SWIBRID distinguishes different types of DSB repair knockouts and identifies the respective genetic defect in cell lines. In 68 patients, we detect immunodeficiencies and DNA repair defects with high accuracy (area under the curve 0.99 and 0.84, respectively), and identify previously uncharacterized patient groups as well as patient-specific CSR junction signatures. With SWIBRID, we seek to advance the identification of pathogenic defects, support early diagnosis, and address molecular heterogeneity that drives variable clinical outcomes."

This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of perineal infections and identify associated risk factors in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma undergoing ELAPE with perineal reconstruction using an absorbable synthetic prosthesis. This prospective observational study including consecutive patients treated between 2009 and 2024. All patients underwent standardized perineal reconstruction with an absorbable synthetic prosthesis. Clinical, tumor, surgical, and postoperative complication variables were recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with perineal infection. A total of 61 patients were analyzed. Perineal infection occurred in 23%, with most infections developing within the first 30 postoperative days. Multivariate analysis identified obesity (Odds Ratio [OR] 74.3), active smoking (OR 33.7), and circumferential margin involvement observed on basal magnetic resonance imaging (OR 28) as independent risk factors. Patients with perineal infection had longer hospital stays, more readmissions, more postoperative visits, and higher complications severity. Infection was not associated with an increased rate of perineal hernia, which was low in our cohort (3%). In conclusion, perineal reconstruction with an absorbable synthetic prosthesis following ELAPE is safe and effective. Identification of patients at high risk for perineal infection enables targeted preventive strategies and informs future comparative studies of perineal reconstruction techniques."

We evaluate a label‑efficient 2D pipeline that uses frozen RAD‑DINO embeddings from native‑resolution axial slices and a lightweight multilayer perceptron for patient‑level risk estimation via mean aggregation and isotonic calibration. Using the NLST CT arm with outcomes defined over a 0-24‑month window, we construct a fixed patient‑level split (one CT per patient; no cross‑split leakage) and perform 25 repeated imbalanced test draws (~ 6% prevalence) to approximate screening conditions. At screening prevalence, RAD‑DINO + MLP achieves PR‑AUC = 0.705 (calibrated; raw 0.554) and ROC‑AUC = 0.817 (raw; 0.736 calibrated), with improved probability reliability following calibration; operating points are selected on validation and reported on test. For secondary ablations only, a near‑balanced cohort (N = 1984) yields accuracy 0.966, precision 0.974, recall 0.973, F1 0.973, and ROC‑AUC 0.912. Beyond classification, retrieval with triplet‑fine‑tuned embeddings attains Precision@5 = 0.853. Interpretability analyses show that cancer cases sustain higher top‑k slice scores and that directional SHAP concentrates on a small subset of high‑probability slices; label‑colored t‑SNE provides qualitative views of embedding structure. Limitations include single‑cohort evaluation, lack of Lung‑RADS labels in public NLST, and a CXR --> CT pretraining shift; future work will pursue external validation and CT‑native self‑supervised continuation. Overall, frozen 2D foundation embeddings provide a strong, transparent, and computationally practical starting point for LDCT screening workflows under realistic prevalence."

    "abstract": "Recent breast cancer research has investigated shape-based attention guidance in Vision Transformer (ViT) models, focusing on anatomical structures and the heterogeneity surrounding tumors. However, few studies have clarified the optimal transformer encoder layer stage for applying attention guidance. Our study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of shape-guidance strategies by varying the combinations of encoder layers that guide attention to breast structures and by comparing the proposed models with conventional models. For the shape-guidance strategy, we applied breast masks to the attention mechanism to emphasize spatial dependencies and enhance the learning of positional relationships within breast anatomy. We then compared the representative models-Masked Transformer models that demonstrated the best performance across layer combinations-with the conventional ResNet50, ViT, and SwinT V2. In our study, a total of 2,436 publicly available mammography images from the Chinese Mammography Database via The Cancer Imaging Archive were analyzed. Three-fold cross-validation was employed, with a patient-wise split of 70% for training and 30% for validation. Model performance on differentiating breast cancer from non-cancer images was assessed by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The results showed that applying masks at the Shallow and Deep stages gave the highest AUROC for Masked ViT. The Masked ViT achieved an AUROC of 0.885 [95% confidence interval: 0.849-0.918], a sensitivity of 0.876, and a specificity of 0.802, outperforming all other conventional models. These results indicate that incorporating mask guidance into particular Transformer encoders promotes representation learning, highlighting their potential as decision-support tools in breast cancer diagnosis."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: This retrospective study compared the outcomes of radiotherapy (RT) and chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with T2N0 hypopharyngeal cancer. METHODS: We analyzed patients with T2N0 hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with RT or CRT between 2011 and 2016 using data from the Head and Neck Cancer Registry of Japan. RESULTS: Among 53,512 patients, 457 with T2N0 disease received RT (n = 165) or CRT (n = 292; median follow-up, 41.8 months; median age, 70 years). Tumor sites included the pyriform sinus (72.9%), postcricoid region (12.3%), posterior wall (11.8%), and unknown (3.1%). The groups differed in terms of age and alcohol use. Before weighing, CRT was associated with longer PFS and a lower cumulative incidence of locoregional recurrence compared with RT. However, in the IPTW-adjusted analysis, CRT did not significantly improve OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-1.62) or PFS (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.53-1.16) compared with RT. PFS was associated with alcohol/smoking history, performance status, and primary site of the tumor. CONCLUSION: In T2N0 hypopharyngeal cancer, CRT reduced the locoregional recurrence compared to RT. However, CRT did not confer a significant OS or PFS advantage over RT after adjustment for baseline imbalances. RT alone may, therefore, be a reasonable definitive treatment option for selected patients."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Our study endeavors to synthesize the expansive literature on cancer-related extracellular vesicles (EVs), mapping the research landscape and identifying key trends. METHODS: Bibliometric analysis was conducted on the EVs and cancer-related studies using the bibliometrix R-package, exploring growth patterns, research hotspots, and trends across 647 journals, 2769 institutions, 9919 authors, 4029 keywords, and 82626 references. To identify and explore the mechanical aspects of EV-cancer signatures, the stringr and dplyr packages were used to extract signatures from article titles and keywords. Functional annotation of these signatures was performed using the clusterProfiler package, and the Human Protein Atlas was utilized to confirm the protein activity of EV signatures in cancer. RESULTS: Our analysis reveals a global, collaborative research effort, with a 5.76% annual growth in publications, yet a decline in average citations post-2013 suggests a need for more impactful research. China, the United States, and Japan emerge as leading contributors, with China showing a notable upward trend. Research hotspots include exosomes, miRNA, biomarkers, and liquid biopsies, with future directions predicted in cancer treatment and diagnostics. EV-cancer signatures are linked to cancer progression and therapy resistance, offering mechanistic insights. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis revealed that several EV-cancer-related signatures were significantly associated with the ferroptosis pathway (p < 0.01), among which PRNP was found to be overexpressed at the protein level in pancreatic carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an overview of cancer-related EV research and identifies key directions for further mechanistic exploration and clinical translation of EVs in precision oncology."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of MAT2A silencing on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer (GC) cells and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: MAT2A expression in GC tissues and adjacent normal tissues was assessed using immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Two GC cell lines with elevated MAT2A expression underwent gene silencing. Cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion were evaluated using EdU incorporation, Transwell, wound healing, and flow cytometry assays. Transcriptomic profiling was conducted to identify downstream pathways affected by MAT2A silencing, demonstrating significant enrichment of the p53 signaling pathway. To further clarify this mechanism, the p53 pathway was inhibited in MAT2A-silenced cells, and changes in p53 and p21 protein expression, along with alterations in proliferation, migration, and invasion, were reassessed. RESULTS: MAT2A expression was significantly higher in GC tissues and cell lines compared with adjacent normal controls. Silencing of MAT2A induced cell cycle arrest, suppressed proliferation and metastatic capacity, and enhanced apoptosis, accompanied by an increased expression of p53 and p21 proteins. Inhibition of p53 with PFT-alpha reduced both p53 and p21 levels and reversed the suppressive effects of MAT2A silencing on GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. CONCLUSION: MAT2A silencing induces cell cycle arrest, enhances apoptosis, and inhibits malignant phenotypes of GC cells, including proliferation, migration, and invasion, through activation of the p53 signaling pathway."

    "abstract": "Apoptosis dysfunction is linked to diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. A key event during apoptosis is mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which typically proceeds in a rapid all-or-none fashion. If MOMP occurs only in a subset of mitochondria (minority MOMP), it can be sublethal and contribute to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Similarly, individual mitochondria escaping widespread MOMP (majority MOMP) can allow cancer cells to recover if apoptosis execution fails. How such heterogeneities in mitochondrial MOMP responsiveness arise within cells is incompletely understood. In particular, whether stochasticity in subcellular protein distributions and interactions across cytosol and mitochondria can realistically contribute to mitochondrial MOMP heterogeneity has not yet been studied. To assess this, we sequentially built and experimentally parameterized a particle-based, cell-sized model including cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments, and that featured a reduced interactome of MCL-1, BAK and tBID. High-performance computing enabled cell-scale simulations of protein distributions and interactions to understand how and under which conditions stochasticity could contribute to heterogeneity in MOMP susceptibility. Our results show that stochastic effects strongly predispose sub-pools of fragmented mitochondria to MOMP under low apoptotic stress. At higher apoptotic stress, fractions of small mitochondria were more likely to escape MOMP than large mitochondria. Retrospective quantification of mitochondrial sizes in experimental scenarios of minority and majority MOMP confirmed these findings. We therefore conclude that stochasticity substantially contributes to enabling small or fragmented mitochondria to undergo MOMP in minority MOMP scenarios and to escape MOMP in majority MOMP scenarios."

    "abstract": "The combination of PARP and NAMPT inhibitors (PARPi/NAMPTi) has been explored for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer, Ewing sarcoma and high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). However, dose limiting toxicity has hampered NAMPTi in clinical trials. To maximise the therapeutic window, we set out to identify predictive genomic biomarkers. Bioinformatic analysis and screening of a panel of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cell lines revealed that cells with RAS/PI3K pathway mutations are sensitive to the NAMPTi FK866. Combined exposure to olaparib and FK866 is associated with a reduction in nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and the PARP substrate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)), with coincident increases in ROS production, DNA damage and apoptosis induction. Caspase 3/7 activity is upregulated to a greater extent in RAS/PI3K mutant cell lines. Finally, the combination significantly reduces omental tumour weight and increases overall survival in mice injected with ID8 Trp53(-/-);Pten(-/-) cells. This study highlights the potential of the PARPi/NAMPTi combination in RAS/PI3K pathway mutant EOC."

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) remains a major threat to women's health, with chemoresistance driven by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Formin-2 (FMN2), a cytoskeletal regulator, was investigated for its role in OC chemoresistance and macrophage polarization. Bioinformatics analysis identified high FMN2 expression in chemotherapy-resistant OC cell lines, validated experimentally. Stable FMN2 knockdown cell lines were generated via lentiviral transfection. Functional assays revealed that FMN2 overexpression conferred chemoresistance in vitro and in vivo and promoted M2 macrophage polarization via the CCL2/JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Co-culture with M2 macrophages enhanced cisplatin (DDP) resistance in OC cells, mediated by CXCL1 secretion, which activated the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Clinically, FMN2 levels correlated with CCL2 and CD206 (M2 marker) in platinum-resistant patients, and high FMN2, CCL2, or CD206 expression predicted poorer overall and disease-free survival. This study identifies FMN2 as a key mediator of chemoresistance and immune evasion in OC, proposing FMN2-CCL2-CD206 signaling and macrophage-derived CXCL1 as therapeutic targets and prognostic markers for chemotherapy response."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Oncofertility support plays a critical role in coping with fertility issues among women with breast cancer. There is a growing demand for reliable tools to assess and enhance oncofertility support. This study aimed to validate a tool assessing oncofertility support. METHODS: The study involved two phases. First, insights from healthcare professionals and women with breast cancer were used to modify the Fertility Information Support Scale, resulting in a 22-item Oncofertility Support Scale. Second, a cross-sectional study was conducted among 343 participants aged 18-40 to assess the scale's content validity, structural validity, measurement invariance, convergent validity, known-group validity, and internal consistency reliability. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis yielded a 19-item scale across four dimensions: information support on fertility impact, information support on fertility preservation, fertility and sexual guidance, and fertility communication and supportive networks. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the scale's structure. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis showed measurement invariance across age and fertility desire groups. The content validity for the scale was 0.95. Oncofertility support showed a weak association with medical social support. Average Variance Extracted (AVE >/= 0.63) and Composite Reliability (CR >/= 0.90) supported the convergent validity of the scale. Women aged </= 30 reported higher information support on fertility preservation and fertility communication and supportive networks than those older than 30. Both Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega were 0.95. CONCLUSION: The Oncofertility Support Scale is a valid and reliable measure for assessing oncofertility support among women with breast cancer."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This PROSPERO-registered systematic review conducted searches through PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS, EBSCOhost, LIVIVO, Embase, and Grey literature (Google Scholar) until March 2025. Therefore, 10 articles were included for the evaluation in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed by Rob-2, and meta-analysis was performed (combined relative risk) in subgroups. The assessment of the certainty of evidence was analyzed by GRADE-pro. RESULTS: From 4118 reviewed articles, 10 RCTs were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, and 4329 patients were evaluated. The Rob was predominantly low. The relative risk of oral mucositis was 1.15 (95% CI = 1.03 to 1.29) higher in cetuximab-plus-radiotherapy compared with cisplatin-plus-radiotherapy in head and neck cancer patients (p = 0.010). There was no heterogeneity (p = 0.890, I(2) = 0%) or Rob's publication (p = 0.404). The GRADE-pro analysis was moderate. CONCLUSION: Cetuximab plus radiotherapy in head and neck cancer patients increases by 1.15 times the risk of oral mucositis. Clinical trials with preventing strategies for OM in cetuximab-treated patients were necessary."

    "abstract": "The incidence of human papillomavirus-positive (HPV(+)) head and neck cancer (HNC), particularly oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), is rising globally. Although radio- or chemo-radiotherapy yields better outcomes for patients with HPV(+) tumors compared to those with HPV-negative tumors, these treatments do not cure all cases and are associated with significant side effects. This underscores the need for more personalized therapy. To help individualize treatment, we evaluated the presence of cell-free HPV DNA (cfHPV-DNA) in plasma collected before, during, and after therapy in patients with HPV(+) HNC and correlated cfHPV-DNA levels with clinical characteristics, HPV genotype, and treatment response. 267 longitudinal plasma samples were collected from 83 patients with HPV(+) HNC/cancer of unknown primary, at diagnosis/recurrence, during treatment and follow-ups, and tested for cfHPV-DNA with droplet digital PCR assaying for HPV16, 18, 33 or 35.39. 76/81 (93.8%) eligible diagnostic or recurrence samples tested positive for cfHPV-DNA, while a diagnostic sample was unavailable/or had inadequate cfDNA in 2/83 cases. cfHPV-DNA levels declined in most patients by 3-4 weeks post-radiotherapy initiation and became undetectable (fast responders) in approximately 30% of cases. By 3-6 months post-treatment, most patients had no detectable cfHPV-DNA. To date, no new recurrences have been documented, although two patients were unresponsive to therapy. Most HPV(+) OPSCC patients were cfHPV-DNA-positive at diagnosis and cleared their cfHPV-DNA upon treatment, but the speed of clearance varied depending on tumor sub-site, patient characteristics and treatment. The data suggest that follow-up with cfHPV-DNA is a promising clinical approach and should be expanded to include more patients and longer time periods."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As larger population-based studies assessing neoplasm risk in neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) are limited, we aimed to evaluate overall neoplasm risk, specific cancer types, and second primary cancers. METHODS: Using Danish registries and clinical databases, we identified 2053 individuals with NF1 and 20,530 population comparisons. We calculated cumulative incidences for first and second primary neoplasms for the study population born 1971-2020 and for adult-onset cancers in the study population born 1951-2020. We used multistate models to estimate the probabilities of being neoplasm-free, having one neoplasm, having >/=two neoplasms or being dead at a certain age. RESULTS: The 50-year cumulative incidence of any first neoplasm was 27.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 23.1-31.4%) for NF1 individuals and 5.0% (4.0-6.0%) for comparisons. Moreover, the cumulative incidence of second primary neoplasm was 21.1% (14.4-27.8%) for NF1 individuals and 6.4% (0.0-15.0%) for comparisons 20 years after the first neoplasm. A person born with NF1 had a 69.8% (65.6-74.2%) probability of being alive and without neoplasm history at age 50 compared to 93.5% (92.4-94.6%) for a person without NF1. CONCLUSION: The highly increased risks for primary and secondary neoplasms and mortality warrant close clinical surveillance of individuals with NF1."

    "abstract": "Anemia is highly prevalent among oncological patients and is often managed with red blood cell transfusions. Current guidelines predominantly rely on hemoglobin levels to guide transfusion, but hemoglobin alone may not accurately reflect oxygen delivery. Physiological triggers, particularly the oxygen extraction ratio (O(2)ER), could provide a more individualized transfusion strategy. This prospective, single-center, observational study included 107 clinically stable adult oncology patients at the Kazakh Institute of Oncology and Radiology. All patients required red blood cell transfusion based on a restrictive trigger (Hb 70 g/L). Patients were stratified into two groups according to their baseline O(2)ER (</= 35.4% or > 35.4%). The primary outcome was the change in O(2)ER before and one hour after transfusion. We also measured changes in central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO(2)), central venous oxygen partial pressure (PvO(2)), arteriovenous oxygen difference (A-V O(2)diff), lactate, and veno-arterial carbon dioxide difference (DeltaCO(2)). Patients with higher baseline oxygen extraction ratio (O(2)ER > 35.4%) demonstrated more pronounced improvements in oxygenation parameters-including O(2)ER, ScvO(2), PvO(2), A‑V O(2) diff, and DeltaCO(2)-following transfusion, compared to patients with O(2)ER </= 35.4%. Although baseline hemoglobin levels and post-transfusion increases in hemoglobin were similar between groups, significant differences were observed across all physiological markers of oxygen transport. Correlation analyses showed significant associations between baseline O(2)ER and changes in PvO(2), ScvO(2), A‑V O(2) diff, DeltaCO(2), and lactate. In contrast, baseline hemoglobin demonstrated no significant correlations with most physiological response parameters, except for a moderate but statistically significant correlation with the change in blood lactate levels. Lactate levels remained within normal limits in the majority of patients, indicating that critical oxygen delivery thresholds were not reached. In stable cancer patients with anemia, hemoglobin levels alone may not adequately capture oxygen delivery status. The oxygen extraction ratio and other physiological triggers offer valuable insights into which patients may benefit most from transfusion. Our findings support a more individualized transfusion strategy, though larger randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm the safety and efficacy of physiological triggers in broader patient populations.Trial Registration The study protocol was retrospectively registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06952361, Initial Release 04/23/2025)."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The expansion of digital health offers a promising avenue to improve care delivery and optimize treatment outcomes. This study evaluated telehealth utilization and its impact on endocrine therapy adherence, clinical outcomes, and healthcare costs. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used claims data from the Merative MarketScan database. Eligible patients were females under 65 years old who were diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer in 2018 and maintained commercial insurance for one year pre-diagnosis and five years post-endocrine therapy initiation. Telehealth utilization was assessed as a binary (user vs. nonuser) measure. Primary outcomes were endocrine therapy adherence, metastasis incidence, and patient-incurred healthcare costs. Associations between telehealth and outcomes were tested using generalized linear models. RESULTS: Among 1,141 eligible patients (mean age: 51 years), 874 (77%) used telehealth, totaling 8,350 visits over five years. Telehealth utilization was consistent across age groups and insurance plans but varied significantly by geographic region, urban-rural status, comorbidity burden, and endocrine therapy regimen. Telehealth use was significantly associated with better adherence (adjusted odds ratio = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.31-1.91; p < 0.0001) but not with metastasis rates. Notably, telehealth users incurred 15% higher out-of-pocket medical costs compared to nonusers (p < 0.0001), though prescription costs did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrate telehealth benefits for long-term adherence to endocrine therapy among commercially insured women under 65 with breast cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Telehealth may help breast cancer survivors stay adherent to endocrine therapy, but its financial burden could limit accessibility and equity in oncology care."

METHODS: The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS; 2013-2019 and 2022-2023) data were used to identify cancer survivors ages 18-64 years. The sample was stratified by smoking status (currently smoke, formerly smoked, and never smoked). Multivariable generalized linear regressions were conducted to examine the associations of smoking status and work productivity loss measures, including labor force participation, inability to work due to health, and any missed workdays (logistic models), and number of missed workdays (negative binomial models). All analyses controlled for sociodemographic characteristics, survey year, and region, accounting for the complex survey design. RESULTS: In total, 8203 (weighted n = 7,048,624) cancer survivors were identified, of whom 1793 (weighted n = 1,387,882; 19.7%) currently smoke, 2189 (weighted n = 1,889,235; 26.5%) formerly smoked, and 4221 (weighted n = 3,771,507; 53.5%) never smoked. In adjusted analyses, the labor force participation rate was similar by smoking status. Survivors who currently smoke were more likely to report an inability to work due to health reasons than those who never smoked (23.9% vs. 18.0%, p < 0.001). Among working cancer survivors (n = 5320), those who currently smoke were more likely to report any missed workdays than those who never smoked (59.7% vs. 53.8%, p = 0.016) and experienced a higher number of missed workdays than those who formerly smoked (13.1 vs. 9.9 days, p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: About one-fifth of working-age cancer survivors report currently smoking, and smoking status is associated with health-related work productivity loss. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Smoking cessation efforts can improve health and reduce productivity loss among working-age cancer survivors."

    "abstract": "Traditional segmentation networks treat anatomical structures as isolated elements, often neglecting their hierarchical relationships. This study introduces Softmax for Arbitrary Label Trees (SALT), a novel method that leverages these hierarchical connections to improve segmentation efficiency and interpretability. SALT is a novel activation function that extends the softmax to arbitrary hierarchical label trees by modeling conditional probabilities along parent-child relations in imaging data. This enables anatomical hierarchies in CT imaging to be represented naturally, allowing segmentations to propagate from broader regions to detailed structures. Using the SAROS dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), which comprises 900 body segmentations from 883 patients and was enhanced by TotalSegmentator to include 113 anatomical labels, the model was trained on 600 scans, with validation and testing on 150. Dice scores across SAROS, CT-ORG, FLARE22, LCTSC, LUNA16, and WORD datasets measured performance, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) from 1000 bootstrapping rounds. SALT achieved top performance on the LUNA16 and SAROS datasets, with Dice scores of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.919-0.938) and 0.929 (95% CI: 0.924-0.933). Reliable accuracy was also observed in CT-ORG (0.891, 95% CI: 0.869-0.906), FLARE22 (0.849, 95% CI: 0.844-0.854), LCTSC (0.908, 95% CI: 0.902-0.914), and WORD (0.844, 95% CI: 0.839-0.85). SALT can segment a 1000-slice CT in 35 s. By leveraging hierarchical body structures, SALT enables rapid whole-body segmentation, processing CT scans in 35 s on average. This capability supports its integration into clinical workflows, enhancing efficiency in automated full-body segmentation and contributing to improved diagnostic workflows and patient care."

Adjuvant therapy is offered to patients who are at a high risk of recurrence, however, determining the patients that would benefit from additional therapy is often difficult. In this study, we aimed to develop a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for post-surgery lung cancer prognostication integrating a multi-modality deep learning model (DLM). Pre-operative medical images and clinical, surgical, and pathological information were fed into an externally validated DLM. A CDSS was then developed to display the patient information and DLM results for potential clinical use. Four oncologists evaluated each patient's recurrence probability, their confidence level, and their post-surgery recommendations both with and without the DLM information. The CDSS DLM information demonstrated the potential to improve user prediction performance and confidence. This exploratory study is the first to integrate a multi-modality DLM for prognostication with a CDSS, as well as the first study of clinician attitudes towards CDSSs for lung cancer."

The sensor utilizes gold nanostructures grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes through a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated electrochemical process. Fabrication involves a two-step immobilization strategy, combining physical vapor deposition (PVD) of a gold thin film with thermal annealing. The nanostructured electrode is subsequently modified electrochemically via PEG mediation, followed by antibody functionalization to enhance binding specificity. PEG-mediated control over nanostructure growth yields irregular short nanorods and leaf-like dendrites, significantly enhancing sensor performance. Extensive electrochemical analyses, including cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy, confirm improved sensitivity and stability. The optimized immunosensor achieves an ultralow detection limit of 6 fg/mL (corresponding to ~ 9500 VEGF molecules in 60 microL, and a broad linear detection range of 10 fg/mL to 10(5) fg/mL, with excellent reproducibility.

    "abstract": "We investigated the role of the intraperitoneal immune microenvironment in the therapeutic response of gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis to intraperitoneal paclitaxel. Gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis has a poor prognosis, even with systemic chemotherapy. Although intraperitoneal paclitaxel administration has demonstrated clinical benefit, treatment resistance remains a major hurdle. Between 2017 and 2023, 30 patients undergoing staging laparoscopy were prospectively enrolled. Immune cell subsets and checkpoint marker expression in peritoneal lavage fluid were analyzed using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Their associations with clinical outcomes were assessed using univariable and multivariable analyses, including Kaplan-Meier, logistic regression, and Ridge regression analyses. Elevated CD4(+) T and CD19(+) B cell levels were associated with inferior progression-free survival, whereas increased natural killer T-like cell levels correlated with improved survival. High FOXP3 and CTLA-4 expression were linked to worse outcomes. Ridge regression identified CD4(+) T cell levels and CTLA-4 expression as unfavorable factors, while the presence of natural killer cells emerged as a favorable factor. An immunoregulatory-dominant immune landscape may drive resistance to intraperitoneal paclitaxel. Immune profiling of ascitic fluid could identify patients likely to benefit from immune-modulating strategies, including those targeting FOXP3(+) and CTLA-4(+) regulatory cells."

The early diagnosis of breast cancer is crucial for successful treatment and improved patient outcomes. Advanced computational techniques, particularly deep transfer learning have gained considerable attention for their effectiveness in medical image computing. Initially, six transfer learning models with different specifications are trained, validated and tested on the breast ultrasound image dataset. Additionally, a novel hybrid model, DRM-Net, is developed by stacking the top three TL models based on concatenation and flattening of deep dense layers. Various techniques, including image preprocessing, image masking, data augmentation, and hyperparameter tuning, are incorporated to enhance the overall performance of the considered models. The models are thoroughly evaluated using various standard metrics and statistical methods. Furthermore, to ensure transparent decision-making, the proposed model is interpreted using XAI-based class activation mapping (CAM) method with different versions. The proposed DRM-Net model demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to the other six transfer learning models. Among all the models, DRM-Net achieved the highest overall performance, with an accuracy of 96.71%, precision of 96%, recall of 97%, F1-score of 97%, and an AUC value of 99%, respectively. It also outperformed state-of-the-art similar studies in the literature. The experimental results demonstrate the potential utility of the hybrid DRM-Net model in improving the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis, which could facilitate informed clinical decision-making.

Although its biological relevance is established, structural impact of such lesions remains partially clarified. Here, reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations have been used for examining spatial distribution of the hydroxylated guanines dictates canonical B-DNA's 3D structure towards canonical B-DNA structure. Through the Dickerson-Drew dodecamer, a standard, five schemes of hydroxylation have been modeled, such as global (MtOH), site-visited (MdOH, MlOH), and orientation-dependent terminal schemes (Ml2r14OH, Ml2r24OH). Five helical deformation descriptors-center-of-base-pair distance (COBP), propeller twist angle (PTA), global/local twist angle (GTA/LTA), and end-to-end DNA length-were obtained from equilibrium trajectory for encoding local/global disturbances structure quantitatively. The results display a clear-cut priority of deformation: fully hydroxylated duplexes display isotropic elongation and wide unwinding, while vertically assembled terminal lesions retain almost native helical structure, oppositely cross-axis lesions, which impose collaborative end-fraying with wide alterations. The results illustrate that more than lesion occurrence, positional symmetry decisively dictates the stability of DNA, giving mechanistic information relevant for mutagenesis, genome instability, and pathogenetic processes under oxidative stress."

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common non-skin related malignancy and the leading cause of cancer death in women. Mammography remains the gold standard for early detection; however, its accessibility is limited in low-resource settings due to cost and technical complexity. Ultrasound (US) is a viable alternative, but its implementation is hindered by the scarcity of trained radiologists and sonographers. Volume sweep imaging (VSI) has addressed the issue of US acquisition by enabling non-specialists to perform standardized scans. However, these still require expert interpretation, limiting their impact. To overcome this barrier, we propose a fully automated Breast VSI (VSI-B) system integrating artificial intelligence (AI) for segmentation and classification of breast lesions, aiming to provide an accessible diagnostic tool for low-resource environments. This study developed an AI-driven diagnostic system for VSI-B, combining a segmentation model (Attention U-Net 3D) with a classification model for lesion detection. A total of 98 patients with palpable breast lumps were included in the study. The dataset consisted of 392 VSI-B US videos and 2,100 classified frames. A new method was implemented to enhance mass identification by selecting key frames for analysis. A majority voting algorithm was used to optimize lesion classification. The system's performance was assessed based on sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Following a detection step that achieved 100% sensitivity and 93.6% specificity for cancer and no cancer patients, as well as 95.0% sensitivity and 63.0% specificity for mass and no mass patients, the DenseNet classification model reached 87% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 83% specificity. A majority voting algorithm optimized classification, yielding an AUC of 0.91. This study highlights the potential of an AI-enabled VSI-B system as a reliable diagnostic tool in low-resource settings. By integrating multi-modal segmentation and classification, the system automates breast lesion detection and stratification, reducing reliance on radiologists. The results suggest that this approach could enhance early breast cancer diagnosis and guide clinical decision-making, particularly in underserved regions."

    "abstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) exhibits significant heterogeneity in clinical outcomes, influenced by histology, age, stage, and molecular characteristics. This study aimed to develop and validate a comprehensive model integrating demographic, clinical, and molecular data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to predict two-year survival outcomes in EOC. The cohort included 2,427 patients with Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma (EA)s and Serous Cystadenocarcinoma (SC) , of whom 1,011 had gene data. Machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated for predictive performance. SVM provided the optimal balance of mortality-class detection and overall performance. While GBC achieved the highest ROC-AUC (0.81), SVM demonstrated superior recall for mortality cases (0.70 vs. 0.61), which was prioritized given our clinical objective. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analyses revealed that WT1, HOXA11, TPM4, TMPRSS2, MUC16, SDHD, and MYC were the most influential predictors of mortality, along with age at diagnosis. Differential gene expression and enrichment analyses identified distinct age- and stage-associated molecular profiles, with genes involved in cell cycle regulation, tumor microenvironment, and growth factor signaling showing significant upregulation. Mutational analyses revealed histology-specific patterns, with TP53, PIK3CA, and ZFHX3 highly mutated in SC, while PTEN and ARID1A were more prevalent in EA. Several mutations, including TP53, FAT3, and FAT4 in EA, and CSMD3 in SC, were associated with poorer survival. Integrating multivariate predictive modeling with biological interpretation provides a comprehensive framework for personalized risk stratification and treatment decision-making in EOC. The identified prognostic biomarkers, such as TPM4, SDHD, MUC16, and BCL6, represent potential targets for future studies and therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women, with hormone receptor-positive (HR + ) disease representing the majority of cases. Despite advances in targeted therapies and antibody-drug conjugates, resistance to treatment remains a significant challenge, necessitating innovative therapeutic strategies. Epigenetic dysregulation, particularly involving histone acetylation, plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and therapy resistance. Lysine acetyltransferase 6 (KAT6A/B), key regulators of chromatin structure and gene expression, have emerged as promising therapeutic targets in HR+ breast cancer. This review highlights the molecular mechanisms by which KAT6A/B modulate histone acetylation and gene regulation, emphasizing their roles in oncogenic pathways and cellular processes such as transcriptional activation, chromatin remodeling, and regulation of cellular senescence. We discuss preclinical evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of KAT6 inhibition and the challenges faced in epigenetic drug development, including the need for robust biomarker-driven approaches. Finally, we explore the prospects for integrating KAT6 inhibitors with existing therapies to overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes in breast cancer."

Most prior studies on fairness in clinical AI focus solely on performance disparities between subpopulations, which often fall short of connecting the technical outputs of AI systems with sociotechnical outcomes. In this work, we present a simulation-based approach to explore how statistical definitions of algorithmic fairness translate to fairness in long-term outcomes, using AI-assisted breast cancer screening as a case example. We evaluate four fairness criteria and their impact on mortality rates and socioeconomic disparities, while also considering how clinical decision makers' reliance on AI and patients' access to healthcare affect outcomes. Our results highlight how algorithmic fairness does not directly translate into fair and equitable outcomes, underscoring the importance of integrating sociotechnical perspectives to gain a holistic understanding of fairness in healthcare AI."

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial hyperfunction is important for cervical cancer progression. Solute carrier family 30 member 9 (SLC30A9) is a member of the solute carrier family 30, specifically a zinc transporter that plays a critical role in mitochondrial zinc homeostasis and maintaining mitochondrial function. We investigated the expression, function, and underlying mechanisms of SLC30A9 in the context of cervical cancer. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed a marked overexpression of SLC30A9 within the malignant epithelial cell population of cervical squamous cell carcinoma. This elevated SLC30A9 expression was further corroborated in clinical specimens from local patients and across various established and primary cervical cancer cells. SLC30A9 shRNA or knockout (via CRISPR/Cas9 method) significantly impeded the viability, proliferation, cell cycle progression and migration, and triggered apoptosis in cervical cancer cells. SLC30A9 depletion disrupted mitochondrial function, inhibiting mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial complex I activity, and ATP production, also caused mitochondrial Zn(2+) accumulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative injury. Conversely, overexpression of SLC30A9 in cervical cancer cells demonstrated enhanced mitochondrial complex I activity, increased ATP production, and augmented cellular proliferation and migration. Bioinformatic analysis, coupled with functional validation, identified PRDM1 (PR Domain Containing 1) as a key transcription factor regulating SLC30A9 expression. Silencing or knockout of PRDM1 resulted in a significant reduction in SLC30A9 promoter activity, as well as decreased SLC30A9 mRNA and protein levels in primary cervical cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirmed increased PRDM1 binding to the SLC30A9 promoter region in cervical cancer tissues. In vivo studies showed that SLC30A9 knockdown led to a remarkable decrease in the growth of xenografts formed by primary cervical cancer cells. These SLC30A9-silenced xenografts exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction, proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction. These findings collectively suggest that PRDM1-driven SLC30A9 overexpression significantly contributes to the malignant phenotype of cervical cancer, possibly through promoting mitochondrial hyperfunction."

    "abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as pivotal regulators driving cancer development and potential therapeutic targets across multiple human malignancies. However, their mechanistic roles during head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) initiation and progression remain incompletely elucidated. Here, we identified a novel oncogenic lncRNA, LINC00973, which was aberrantly upregulated in clinical samples and associated with aggressive clinicopathological features and adverse clinical outcomes. LINC00973 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and inhibited cell apoptosis and senescence in vitro, and induced tumor growth and lymph node metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC00973 functioned as a molecular sponge for tumor-suppressive miR-6756-3p, consequently stabilizing transcription factor Engrailed-2 (EN2) mRNA and activating NOTCH pathway to promote HNSCC progression. Integrative epigenomics/transcriptomics analyses coupled with molecular assays revealed a proximal super-enhancer (SE) within the LINC00973 locus, which recruited Activator Protein 1 (AP-1)/FOS Like 1 (FOSL1), BRD4, and EP300, thereby collectively activating its transcription. CRISPR interference assay identified four functional enhancer elements of LINC00973-SE and H3K27ac HiChIP data analysis suggested enhancer-promoter contacts, collectively contributing to LINC00973 transcription. Clinically, the abundance of LINC00973, miR-6756-3p, EN2, and NOTCH1 in HNSCC samples was correlated and significantly associated with patients' survival. Collectively, our findings revealed a hitherto uncharacterized SE-driven LINC00973-miR-6756-3p-EN2 regulatory axis to facilitate HNSCC progression and highlighted LINC00973 as a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target with considerable translational potential."

    "abstract": "Clinical efficacy of anti-PD1 immunotherapy often yields low response rates in Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC). To gain insights into immune escape mechanisms and discover critical molecules in anti-tumor immunity, we performed an immune checkpoint screening using transcriptome profiling and immunohistochemistry analyses. We identified CD276 as an independent immunosuppressive molecule that correlates with poor EBVaGC prognosis. Our in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate the role of CD276 in inducing T cell apoptosis and diminishing chemokine secretion, thereby dampening immune response and facilitating tumor progression. Mechanistically, we discovered that YAP/TEAD4 chromatin occupancy at CD276 regulatory regions leads to its transcriptional upregulation in EBVaGC, driven by EBNA1-stimulated MST1/2-LATS1/2-YAP signaling. Notably, in a humanized xenograft mouse model, EBVaGC with elevated CD276 levels exhibited resistance to anti-PD1 immunotherapy, while targeting CD276 in combination with PD1 blockade significantly reduced tumor size. Collectively, our findings elucidate the EBNA1-YAP-CD276 axis as a novel mechanism of immune escape in EBVaGC, providing insights for enhanced immunotherapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Although androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies, such as enzalutamide, initially improve outcomes of prostate cancer (PCa) patients, resistance inevitably develops, partly driven by prostate cancer stem-like cells (PCSCs). However, the molecular mechanisms linking the maintenance of PCSCs to enzalutamide resistance (ENZR) remain incompletely elucidated. Here, we implicate Ca(2)(+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 1D (CAMK1D) in PCSC-mediated ENZR. CAMK1D was consistently upregulated in PCa with ENZR and contributed to ENZR by enhancing mitophagy in PCa cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, CAMK1D promotes the expansion of PCSCs by enhancing mitophagy through activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/PINK1 signaling pathway, thereby facilitating cellular adaptation. We revealed that CAMK1D interacts with and phosphorylates AMPK at Thr172, which in turn activates PINK1 to modulate mitophagy, ultimately supporting the expansion of PCSCs under enzalutamide treatment. In a mouse orthotopic PCa model, targeting the CAMK1D/AMPK pathway with the siCAM/HLNP nanoformulation suppresses tumor growth by depleting the PCSCs population, achieving a synergistic effect with enzalutamide therapy. Our findings identify CAMK1D as a key regulator of ENZR that maintains stemness by orchestrating mitophagy, thereby establishing mitophagy as an important nexus between CAMK1D-mediated ENZR and AMPK-driven PCSC enrichment. Therapeutically, we developed a CAMK1D-targeted approach that potently reverses ENZR and improves treatment responses."

    "abstract": "Ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) are key regulators of protein homeostasis and have been implicated in various aspects of cancer development, including colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we investigated the role of USP11 in CRC pathogenesis. RNA-seq analysis of tumor and matched normal tissues from 35 CRC patients identified USP11 as significantly overexpressed in tumor samples. Elevated USP11 expression was correlated with reduced patient survival, suggesting its prognostic significance. Functional experiments using USP11-knockout and USP11-overexpressing CRC cell lines (HCT-15 and HT-29) revealed that USP11 promotes tumor cell proliferation, migration, colony formation, and 3D spheroid growth. Biochemical assays demonstrated that USP11 stabilizes EGFR and TRAF6 by removing K48-linked ubiquitin chains, thereby preventing their proteasomal degradation. These interactions potentiate both EGFR and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways, contributing to CRC tumorigenesis. Loss of USP11 led to significant reductions in EGFR and TRAF6 protein levels, resulting in impaired tumorigenic behavior in vitro and in mouse xenograft models. Furthermore, USP11 deficiency suppressed tumor spheroid formation in response to EGF, HKLM (a TLR2 agonist), and LPS (a TLR4 agonist), whereas USP11 overexpression amplified these effects. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of USP11 with mitoxantrone markedly decreased spheroid growth in both EGFR- and TLR-driven models, supporting its therapeutic potential. Overall, our findings reveal that USP11 contributes to CRC progression by stabilizing EGFR and TRAF6, thereby enhancing oncogenic signaling. These insights identify USP11 as a promising molecular target for CRC treatment and support the repurposing of mitoxantrone as an inhibitor of USP11-driven tumor growth."

    "abstract": "RecQ family of DNA helicases play pivotal roles in DNA replication, repair and responses to DNA damage or replication stress. Several human RecQ helicases are defective in diseases associated with chromosomal instability, premature aging and cancer. We recently discovered novel mutations in the RECQL4 gene in glioblastoma (GBM), the most malignant brain tumor in adults. Transcriptomic profiles of GBMs with REQCL4 mutations resembled those in REQCL4 KO glioma cells. We employ structural modelling and biochemical approaches to elucidate impacts of novel mutations on RECQL4 helicase activities. Using recombinant RECQL4(P532S) and RECQL4(R766Q) proteins we demonstrate that P532S substitution reduces the RECQL4 ability to unwind DNA and disrupts DNA-coupled ATP-hydrolysis activity. WT and mutated RECQL4 were overexpressed in RECQL4 KO glioma cells to study interactions with BLM helicases, cell viability and specific responses to UVC- and chemotherapy-induced DNA damage/repair. Overexpression of RECQL4(P532S) or RECQL4(R766Q) variants affected DNA repair and responses to chemotherapeutics in glioma cells, and RECQL4(R766Q) disturbed interactions with the BLM helicase. Our results reveal deleterious consequences of novel RECQL4 mutations in GBMs. The newly identified RECQL4 mutations affect RECQL4 helicases and their interactions with BLM contributing to glioma progression."

    "abstract": "Hypoxia-induced radioresistance presents a major barrier to effective radiotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), while the underlying role of macrophages remaining elusive. In this study, we found that, compared with normoxia-derived tumor exosomes, hypoxia-derived tumor exosomes more potently promoted M2 polarization of macrophages and TGF-beta1/IL-10 secretion via NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit V2 (NDUFV2), as evidenced by the increased mitochondrial functions, including oxidative phosphorylation, ATP levels and mitochondrial membrane potentials, which collectively suppressed macrophage ferroptosis in an NDUFV2-dependent manner. When co-cultured with these exosome-educated macrophages, bystander normoxic NSCLC cells acquired radioresistance, which was attributed to the inhibition of ferroptosis. Notably, NDUFV2-knockdown macrophages abrogated this exosome-induced radioresistance. Mechanistically, IL-10 might be a pivotal signaling messenger rendering radioresistance of bystander normoxic cells. In vivo, hypoxic exosomes also conferred radioresistance to NSCLC xenografts in mice with intact macrophage populations but not in those with macrophage depletion. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that irradiated xenografts treated with hypoxic exosomes exhibited significantly higher expression levels of GPX4, Ki67, HIF1alpha, CD163, and NDUFV2. Furthermore, GPX4 knockdown in xenografts reversed the radioresistance induced by hypoxic exosomes and was associated with reduced infiltration of M2-polarized macrophages, supporting the central role of ferroptosis in macrophage-regulated, hypoxia-induced radioresistance. Clinical tissue microarray analysis further confirmed that NDUFV2 was significantly upregulated in NSCLC tissues and correlated with advanced stages. Collectively, this study disclosed for the first time that hypoxic exosomes suppressed macrophage inflammatory responses and ferroptosis via NDUFV2, thereby enhancing radioresistance in bystander normoxic NSCLC cells."

However, existing self-advocacy assessment tools-developed by Western scholars-are poorly aligned with the cultural and healthcare context of China. AIM: The study aimed to develop and validate a new self-advocacy scale tailored to Chinese cancer patients. METHODS: In phase I, an item pool was formulated through a literature review, qualitative interviews with 14 cancer patients, and focus group discussions. In phase II, the scale's domains and items were revised based on feedback from two rounds of Delphi consultation involving 16 experts. In phase III, a cross-sectional survey was administered to a convenient sample of 257 cancer patients, and item analysis and exploratory factor analysis were used to explore the scale's structure. In Phase IV, the scale's validity and reliability were comprehensively evaluated using data from a convenience sample of 311 cancer patients. Finally, the Cancer Patient Self-Advocacy Scale (CPSAS) was developed. RESULTS: The newly developed scale comprised 21 items across four dimensions: information seeking, autonomous decision-making, active communication, and informational support. The scale demonstrated adequate convergent and discriminant validity supported by average variance extracted and composite reliability, good criterion validity through significant correlations with quality of life and treatment adherence, and excellent internal consistency and split-half reliability. CONCLUSIONS: The CPSAS is a valid, reliable, and efficient tool for assessing self-advocacy in Chinese cancer patients, suitable for both outpatient and inpatient settings. Additional research is necessary to evaluate the psychometric properties of the scale."

This study aims to evaluate the predictive value of SUV(max) on preoperative PSMA PET/CT for metastatic development after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). METHODS: This retrospective two-centre study included patients with nonmetastatic primary prostate cancer who underwent [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 or [(18)F]DCFPyL PSMA PET/CT prior to RARP. The minimum follow-up period was 1 yr. Metastases were assessed by restaging PSMA PET/CT at biochemical recurrence. SUV(max) was calculated for the dominant intraprostatic lesion on preoperative PSMA PET/CT. Multivariable Cox regression included SUV(max), clinical tumour stage (cT), initial prostate-specific antigen density, percentage positive biopsy cores, and biopsy International Society of Urological Pathology grade group. SUV(max) thresholds and model performance were investigated. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 293 patients underwent preoperative PSMA PET/CT, of whom 53 developed metastases after a median follow-up of 39 mo (interquartile range [IQR] 29-54). SUV(max) was higher in participants who developed metastases at 2-yr follow-up than in those without metastases (median 8.8; IQR 7.1-16 vs 7.8; IQR 5.7-13; p = 0.015). An SUV(max) of >10 was associated with an increased metastatic risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-3.13; p = 0.035) and log-SUV(max) independently predicted metastases (HR 2.80; 95% CI 1.02-7.70; p = 0.046). The limitations include potential selection and detection biases due to selective follow-up imaging and nonstandardised treatment decisions. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In patients with primary prostate cancer, preoperative SUV(max) is associated with metastatic progression after RARP. An SUV(max) of >10 may aid in risk stratification for adverse outcomes."

This study aims to perform a real-world analysis of the predictive value of prior NMIBC for the effectiveness of NAC in patients undergoing RC for MIBC. METHODS: We included 2378 patients from the BLADRAC cohort who received RC with (n = 870; 37%) or without (n = 1508; 63%) NAC for primary (n = 1825; 77%) or secondary (n = 553; 23%) MIBC at 15 French centers from 2001 to 2023. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to identify the predictors of NAC delivery as well as those of pathological complete (pCR = [y]pT0N0) and pathological objective (pOR </=[y]pT1N0) responses, while we assessed the predictors of recurrence-free (RFS), cancer-specific (CSS), and overall (OS) survival using multivariable Cox regression models. The heterogeneity of treatment effect of NAC according to the occurrence of prior NMIBC was determined further by testing the interaction terms between the occurrence of prior NMIBC and the effect of NAC within the models evaluating pathological and survival outcomes. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Patients with secondary MIBC were significantly less likely to receive NAC (odds ratio [OR] = 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.5-0.79]; p < 0.001) than those with primary MIBC. The use of NAC was an independent predictor of better pCR (OR = 6.02; 95% CI = [4.63-7.83]; p < 0.001), pOR (OR = 5.08; 95% CI = [4.09-6.3]; p < 0.001), RFS (HR = 0.61; 95% CI = [0.53-0.71]; p < 0.001), CSS (HR = 0.57; 95% CI = [0.47-0.69]; p < 0.001), and OS (HR = 0.61; 95% CI = [0.51-0.72]; p < 0.001), while the occurrence of prior NMIBC was not significantly associated with any of these endpoints (all p > 0.05). There was no significant interaction between the occurrence of prior NMIBC and the impact of NAC on pCR, pOR, RFS, CSS, and OS (all p(interaction) > 0.05). The study is limited by its retrospective design. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our real-world data suggest that the occurrence of prior NMIBC could limit the access to NAC, while not predicting its effectiveness in patients treated with RC for localized MIBC."

This review summarized the latest developments in targeted and immune-based therapies for PDAC. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed (MEDLINE) and Web of Science, identifying 36 studies on targeted therapies and 24 studies on immunotherapies relevant to PDAC. Several investigational and approved agents, including KRAS inhibitors (MRTX1133, sotorasib), PARP inhibitors (olaparib), and immune checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab), have demonstrated encouraging results, particularly in combination regimens. These findings provide valuable insights into future research and clinical strategies aiming at improving the prognosis of PDAC."

Exercise is feasible, safe, and beneficial for many cancer patient groups, however, no studies have examined exercise for NMIBC. We aimed to examine the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for patients with NMIBC during or after intravesical therapy. METHODS: The Bladder cancer and exeRcise trAining during or after intraVesical thErapy (BRAVE) trial randomized 25 NMIBC patients scheduled for or on surveillance after intravesical therapy to either usual care (n = 12) or HIIT (n = 13). The HIIT group performed thrice-weekly, supervised HIIT for 12 weeks. RESULTS: In 39 months, 293 patients were screened, 177 (60.4%) were eligible, and 25 (14.1%) were randomized. Median exercise attendance was 100%. From baseline to 12 weeks, VO(2peak) increased by 1.2 mL/kg/min in the HIIT group compared to a decrease of 0.7 mL/kg/min in the usual care group (adjusted between-group difference, 2.0 mL/kg/min; 95% CI: -0.4 to 4.4; P = .10; d = 0.37). Compared to the usual care group at 12 weeks, the HIIT group significantly improved 6-minute walk distance (adjusted between-group difference, 41 meters; 95% CI: 6-77; P = .025; d = 0.32) and the timed 8-foot up-and-go (adjusted between-group difference, -1.0 second; 95% CI: -1.9 to -0.2; P = .019; d = -0.44). CONCLUSIONS: Despite modest accrual, the BRAVE trial demonstrated that HIIT during or after intravesical therapy was safe and feasible for most NMIBC patients and resulted in meaningful improvements in several indicators of physical functioning. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Oncology nurses can inform NMIBC patients that high-intensity interval training may be safe, feasible, and potentially effective in improving physical functioning during or after intravesical therapy."

This design allows direct, in-tip measurement of LET in plasma without prior sample pretreatment. The MOT sensor showed a wide linear range (1.0-38.0 pM) for LET with outstanding sensitivity (LOD: 0.32 pM). When applied to human plasma, it achieved accurate results with an excellent recovery range (98.78-105.65 %), which shows that it could be a powerful tool for decentralized therapeutic drug monitoring and personalized medicine."

Breast-related adverse events (BRAEs) are common among patients treated with Enza monotherapy (Enza-Mono). We review relevant clinical trial data, including unpublished data, on measures to prevent BRAEs. Given the absence of data on mitigating strategies for Enza-associated BRAEs, we draw on pertinent prophylactic strategies used in studies of bicalutamide, a nonsteroidal antiandrogen with a similar mechanism of action. We critically discuss the clinical implications of such strategies to support decision-making in patients receiving Enza-Mono. METHODS: We searched PubMed for clinical trials on the safety of Enza-Mono, with a focus on BRAEs. We added relevant unpublished data from the EMBARK and ENACT trials. We also explored the literature and summarize prophylactic strategies for bicalutamide-induced BRAEs. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: In three trials involving 533 patients treated with Enza-Mono, Enza-Mono (160 mg/d) was commonly associated with gynecomastia (37-49%), breast pain or tenderness (14-26%), and/or nipple pain (15-30%). No prophylactic measures for BRAEs were protocol-specified in these studies. Previous studies with bicalutamide (150 mg/d) reported the benefits and relative tolerability of prophylactic radiation therapy and/or tamoxifen or prophylactic anastrozole to mitigate gynecomastia or breast pain. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Given the absence of data on prophylactic strategies for Enza-associated BRAEs, findings from bicalutamide studies could be extrapolated to Enza-Mono. Prospective trials are needed to optimize prophylactic strategies for BRAEs with Enza-Mono."

The risk of bias was evaluated using the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool (CRD42025641514). KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 31 studies, including 9416 patients treated with TMT for MIBC, met the inclusion criteria. Older age (per year increase; HR: 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.05), poor performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group >/=2 vs 0-1; HR: 2.47, 95% CI: 1.78-3.43), impaired renal function (HR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.12-1.92), presence of hydronephrosis (HR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.17-2.34), advanced T stage (HR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.23-1.77), nodal involvement (HR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.10-3.30), and concomitant carcinoma in situ (HR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.02-3.20) were independently associated with worse overall survival. Limitations included heterogeneity in treatment protocols and potential residual confounding across studies. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Specific patient- and tumor-related factors are significantly associated with prognosis in patients undergoing TMT for MIBC. These findings may aid in refining patient selection and risk stratification for TMT-based bladder-preserving approaches."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although minimally invasive surgery is widely accepted across surgical disciplines, its role in pancreatic cancer continues to be debated. The objective of the Sao Paulo Consensus on Minimally Invasive Pancreatic Surgery (MIPS) was to establish consensus statements on the use of MIPS for pancreatic cancer, integrating contemporary evidence and recent advances. METHODS: A scoping literature review informed statement development across five thematic groups: (1) Left Pancreatectomy for Pancreatic Cancer, (2) Pancreatoduodenectomy and Total Pancreatectomy for Pancreatic Cancer, (3) Neuroendocrine Pancreatic Tumors, (4) Patient Evaluation and Surgical Technique, and (5) Implementation, Training, and Innovation. A three-round modified Delphi process was conducted with an international panel of 52 expert pancreas surgeons. Consensus was defined as >/=90 % agreement. RESULTS: From 2590 publications, 185 studies were selected for inclusion. Fifty-two hepatopancreatobiliary surgeons, with a median of 22 years of experience, achieved consensus through a three-round Delphi process. Ultimately, 22 of the initial 28 statements met the >/=90 % agreement threshold. The resulting recommendations provide evidence-based guidance on minimally invasive pancreas resection for cancer, including neuroendocrine tumors, patient evaluation, program implementation, and innovation. DISCUSSION: The Sao Paulo Consensus provides contemporary, evidence-based recommendations to guide the safe and judicious adoption, implementation, and practice of minimally invasive techniques."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, with inherited cases conferring a markedly increased risk. The underlying mechanisms driving malignant transformation by CP remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: Combining a recently developed mouse model of CP carrying the human carboxypeptidase A1 (CPA1) p.N256K mutation with the established Kras(G12D) pancreatic cancer model, we characterised mechanisms linking chronic inflammation to early pancreatic carcinogenesis. DESIGN: We crossed Cpa1 (N256K) mice (Cpa1) with Ptf1a(Cre);Kras(LSL-G12D) (KC). In Cre, Cpa1, KC and KC-Cpa1 mice, we performed phenotypical characterisation at five early time points and in an ageing cohort. Assessment of histology combined with both RNA-sequencing and single-cell RNA-sequencing was performed to analyse metaplasia, preneoplastic lesions and cellular heterogeneity. RESULTS: KC-Cpa1 pancreata displayed a stark increase in remodelling, fibrosis and formation of metaplastic lesions as compared with KC. Cpa1(N256K) induced extensive plasticity in both the acinar and ductal compartment, including an early acinar-to-ductal metaplasia state in acinar cells characterised by an upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers and an inflammatory ductal phenotype (iDucts). We characterised the complex cell-cell communication networks underlying both pancreatic inflammation and early carcinogenesis, revealing disease-specific signalling between ductal cells, granulocytes and fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: The humanised KC-Cpa1 mouse model reveals the interplay of inflammation in hereditary CP and carcinogenesis. Cpa1(N256K) -induced plasticity in acinar and ductal cells, inflammation and cell-cell interaction networks cooperate with Kras(G12D) in early pancreatic carcinogenesis."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Despite several factors are associated with worse disease-free survival (DFS) and prognosis in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) patients, the effect of microscopic extrathyroidal extension (mETE) on the prognosis and DFS is not well understood. This study aims to evaluate the impact of mETE on DFS and prognosis in patients with MTC. METHODS: This multicenter study included 208 patients with MTC (17.8% with hereditary disease). Patients with mETE were compared to those without mETE in terms of clinical and histopathological variables. RESULTS: Among the 208 patients, 16.3% (n=34) had mETE on histopathological analysis. Patients with mETE were more likely to have larger tumors, higher serum calcitonin (CTN) levels before and after surgery, increased rates of neck lymph node (LN) and distant metastasis, multifocal disease, and advanced disease stage. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly lower DFS in patients with mETE than those without mETE (14.7% vs. 71.3%, log-rank p<0.001). However, mETE was not an independent contributing factor for persistent/recurrent disease, whereas neck LN involvement was the strongest independent contributing factor for persistent/recurrent disease (HR: 1.1; 95% CI 0.4-1.8, p=0.76 and HR: 9.6; 95% CI 1.21-76.9, p=0.03, respectively). CONCLUSION: mETE in patients with MTC is associated with a lower DFS, larger tumor sizes, a higher likelihood of neck LN and distant metastasis, advanced stage, higher serum CTN levels, multifocality, and persistent/recurrent disease. However, mETE was not an independent predictor of persistent/recurrent disease. Further studies with a larger number of patients with mETE could further clarify the impact of mETE on the prognosis of MTC."

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy is an increasingly used treatment for different types of cancer. The most widely used are cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors, PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) inhibitors and PD-1 receptor inhibitors. All of them can produce endocrine autoimmune side effects in multiple organs. The most frequent are thyroid disorders and hypophysitis although, less frequently, they can also cause autoimmune adrenalitis and autoimmune diabetes. Thyroid involvement is usually transient but can become chronic in the form of hypothyroidism in more than 50% of cases. Diabetes is due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta-cells, in many cases abrupt and irreversible. The 2 entities occur more frequently with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors. This is the case of a patient with cutaneous melanoma on pembrolizumab who simultaneously developed thyroiditis and fulminant autoimmune diabetes."

Extensive imaging and biopsies failed to identify a definitive adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting tumour, but pulmonary nocardiosis was diagnosed, reflecting profound cortisol-induced immunosuppression. Management was further complicated by limited social supports and a history of unstable housing, raising concerns about access to advanced imaging and reliable follow-up. Despite medical therapy, hypercortisolism persisted, and she ultimately underwent bilateral adrenalectomy with marked improvement.

It is uncommon in colorectal cancer (CRC) and, without treatment, is often fatal within days. We describe a woman in her 50s who developed transfusion-refractory anaemia and thrombocytopaenia during workup for suspected metastatic CRC. Haemolysis screen was positive, and blood film showed fragmentation and leukoerythroblastosis, suggesting paraneoplastic MAHA. Following multidisciplinary discussion, she underwent D3 right hemicolectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies. Despite brief postoperative improvement, her MAHA progressed, and she passed away on day 2. Pathology revealed ileocaecal signet ring cell adenocarcinoma with bilateral Krukenberg tumours, peritoneal metastases and 31/31 positive nodes (stage IVc). This case highlights the life-threatening nature of CRC-MAHA and challenges in diagnosis and management. Prompt anticancer therapy offers the only hope at remission; however, salvage is difficult. Emergency surgery may be considered in exceptional cases where rapid deterioration precludes systemic therapy."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite breakthroughs in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), tumor immune evasion remains a major limitation to immunotherapy efficacy. PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) has highlighted roles in immune system regulation and tumor progression, but its specific role in HCC and impact on ICB response remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate how PINK1 dysfunction enables HCC adaptation to ICB-induced immune attacks and identify potential therapeutic targets. METHODS: Online patient dataset analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of reduced PINK1 expression on clinical prognosis in HCC. An orthotopic HCC tumor cell mouse model was established. Single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry were employed to explore the immune characteristics and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment in PINK1-deficient HCC. Neutrophils and T cells were isolated, stimulated, and/or cultured for ex vivo functional assays. Gene Expression Omnibus database analyses were performed to identify key genes involved in HCC resistance to ICB. RESULTS: We identified PINK1 as a key mediator of ICB resistance in HCC. We found that PINK1 expression was significantly reduced in ICB-resistant HCC and a reduced PINK1 signature was associated with poorer clinical outcomes in patients with HCC. Importantly, PINK1 deficiency serves as a predictive biomarker for diminished responsiveness to immunotherapy. Function experiments have revealed that PINK1 regulates HCC progression and infiltration and activation of neutrophils and T cells. Mechanistically, the tumor cell-intrinsic downregulation of PINK1 activated the production of chemokines involved in neutrophil recruitment, and tumor-infiltrating neutrophils inhibited T cell activity. Additionally, a neutrophil-depleting antibody resensitized tumors to antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 therapy in orthotopic HCC models, further demonstrating that neutrophils are the primary population responsible for the adaptation of cancer cells with reduced PINK1 to ICB-induced immune attacks. CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered PINK1 as both a predictor of the ICB response and a key mediator of immune evasion by promoting neutrophil infiltration. These results highlight that the therapeutic targeting of neutrophils may represent a viable strategy to overcome ICB resistance in HCC."

Since efforts to isolate colibactin have not been successful, we developed colibactin 742 (3a/b) as a stable colibactin mimetic. However, colibactin 742 (3a/b) exists as a mixture of ring and chain isomers, which complicates analysis of its activity. We report here the discovery of colibactin 686 (9) as a superior colibactin mimetic. Colibactin 686 (9) is more potent than colibactin 742 (3a/b) and recapitulates the bacterial genotoxic phenotype. Colibactin 686 (9) possesses a C(2)-symmetric structure, which will expedite its synthesis, and is incapable of ring-chain isomerization, which will simplify analysis of its biological activity. We additionally establish that colibactins do not passively diffuse into cells, and are substrates for monocarboxylate transporter pumps. These latter findings have implications for trafficking of natural colibactin, which remains poorly understood."

    "abstract": "While the contribution of the IGF-signaling axis in breast cancer is well documented, the role of IGFBP-6 in breast carcinogenesis has not been extensively studied. In general, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-6 (IGFBP-6) sequesters Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) to attenuate activation of its cognate receptor IGF-1R. To reveal previously unknown mechanisms of breast cancer modulation by IGFBP-6 in breast cancer, proteomic analysis was performed in T47D cells after IGFBP-6 knockdown. Comparing protein expression and phosphosites after knockdown by unique siRNA sequences with a negative control and subsequent pathway analysis, a decrease in IGFBP-6 expression resulted in activation of interferon signaling pathways and a decrease in pathways involved in the G2/M cell cycle transition. A subset of the proteins identified in each cell regulatory pathway were validated by immunoblotting for specific proteins after IGFBP-6 knockdown. Cell cycle analysis showed that IGFBP-6 knockdown in Hormone Receptor Positive T47D breast cancer cells resulted in an increased number of cells in the G1 phase and a decrease in cells in G2 indicating a role for IGFBP-6 in cell cycle regulation. Knockdown of IGFBP-6 in a Triple Negative breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, also resulted in a decrease in Cyclin B1 accumulation demonstrating that our observations are not cell line specific. Taken together, our results demonstrate that IGFBP-6 regulates cell cycle progression in breast cancer cells and interferon signaling in hormone positive cells."

    "abstract": "Corepressors CtBP1 and CtBP2 (CtBP1/2) are evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulators that repress gene expression by recruiting chromatin modifiers, yet the structural basis of this process remains elusive. Here, we identify a direct interaction between CtBP1/2 and the histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase G9a. Crystallographic and biochemical analyses reveal that a CtBP1/2 tetramer simultaneously engages two G9a molecules through a motif within the pre-SET domain of G9a, which is absent in its paralog GLP. This interaction enhances G9a catalytic activity in a manner strictly dependent on the oligomeric state of CtBP1/2. Disruption of CtBP2 tetramerization diminishes its association with G9a and abolishes enzymatic activation, underscoring the functional importance of CtBP1/2 oligomerization. In colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells, CtBP2 and G9a co-occupy the PTEN promoter, where disruption of their interface reduces H3K9me2 deposition, derepresses PTEN expression, attenuates PI3K-AKT signaling, and impairs CRC cell proliferation. Together, these findings establish a structural framework for CtBP-mediated regulation of G9a activity and highlight the CtBP1/2-G9a complex as a potential therapeutic target in colorectal cancer."

    "abstract": "The volume-regulated anion channel VRAC is a hetero-hexamer composed of LRRC8A and any of the four other LRRC8 paralogs (LRRC8B-E). Depending on their subunit composition, VRACs not only transport chloride, but also a range of organic substrates including 2'3'-cGAMP (cGAMP). Transfer of this immunomodulator from tumor to host cells is critical for anti-tumor immunity. Whether this process depends on VRAC in vivo remains incompletely understood. To address this issue, we studied subcutaneous MC38 and B16-F10 tumors in syngeneic mice. Enhanced growth of MC38 tumors lacking cGAMP production confirmed the importance of tumor-produced cGAMP. The impact of VRAC-mediated cGAMP-efflux from tumor cells and its uptake into cells of the tumor microenvironment was investigated using LRRC8A-deficient tumor cells and recipient mice with selective LRRC8 subunit disruptions, respectively. Changed serum cytokines indicated moderate immunomodulatory effects of VRAC-mediated cGAMP export from MC38 tumors. However, tumor growth and the cGAMP-mediated anti-tumor immune response were independent of both, tumor- and host-expressed VRAC. Disruption of any of the non-essential subunits, LRRC8B-LRRC8E, had no discernible effect on T or B cell development in mice. Whereas tumor-produced cGAMP markedly suppresses tumor growth, transport of this immunomodulator to the tumor environment primarily involves transporters distinct from VRAC."

Nevertheless, there is still a lack of research that explores the characteristics of hypoxia in pan-cancer at the single-cell level and assesses the application of hypoxia in ICI efficacy and clinical outcomes. We delineated cell-specific hypoxia levels and developed a computational framework to generate a pan-cancer tumor hypoxia-related transcriptomic signature (HYP.SIG) using 38 scRNA-seq datasets encompassing 362 patients and 893464 cells across 19 cancer types. We defined computational indicators of hypoxia levels as HYP.SIG scores to characterize the hypoxia status across 33 cancer types and 29 normal tissues within 18901 samples. HYP.SIG scores exhibited cancer type-specific associations with genetic instability, and were linked to oncogenic signaling, poor response to ICI therapy, and impaired survival in multiple cancer types. Moreover, we established a predictive model for immunotherapy response utilizing 6 machine learning algorithms and 9 ICI cohorts (904 patients, 4 cancer types). HYP.SIG achieved better predictive performances in comparison to other previously established signatures. Subsequently, we applied three machine learning-based feature selection algorithms to filter HYP.SIG survival-related signatures and developed a prognostic model for predicting overall survival, incorporating clinical disease stages. Eventually, we screened four candidate therapeutic targets (LDHA, SERF2, SLC2A1, NOP53) for patients with tumors using 17 CRISPR cohorts and 1078 CRISPR cell lines. Overall, our study provides new ideas for survival prognostication, prediction of ICI response, and clinical therapeutic target development from the perspective of hypoxia."

Primary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), resolution of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), and composite renal endpoints. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central were searched through June 30, 2025, following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials in adults (>/=18 years) with >/=24-week follow-up comparing semaglutide (>/=0.5 mg weekly subcutaneous or >/=7 mg daily oral) versus placebo or active comparators. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed bias (RoB 2) and certainty (GRADE). RESULTS: Thirty-five trials (n = 36,847; mean age 54.2 years; BMI 34.8 kg/m(2)) were included. Semaglutide reduced HbA1c (-1.52%, 95% CI -1.60 to -1.44) and weight (-12.4 kg, 95% CI -13.0 to -11.8). Non-glycemic benefits included MACE reduction (16%, RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.77-0.92), MASH resolution (62.9%, RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.49-2.27), renal protection (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.68-0.85), improved vascular function (+87 m walking distance), favorable body composition (87:13 fat-to-lean ratio), and better quality of life (+3.8 SF-36 points). No increase was observed in psychiatric or cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Semaglutide confers robust, consistent multisystem benefits-including cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal protection-supporting its role as a transformative, disease-modifying therapy for metabolic disease beyond diabetes and obesity management.These findings support using semaglutide as a comprehensive, disease-modifying therapy for complex metabolic disorders, guiding clinicians to integrate it into patient-centered care for multisystem benefits beyond glycemic and obesity control."

A comprehensive search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science up to August 31, 2025 identified 46 eligible studies including 20,570 patients, following PRISMA guidelines and QUADAS-2 quality assessment. Random-effects models were applied to evaluate associations between BRAF status and major oncological outcomes. BRAF V600E mutation was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (OR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.17-1.61) and showed a borderline association with recurrence risk (OR = 1.56; 95% CI, 1.00-2.41). In contrast, no significant associations were observed for distant metastases (OR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.48-1.17) or cancer-related mortality (OR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.64-1.49). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of all pooled estimates. Meta-regressions revealed an inverse relationship between BRAF mutation prevalence and its prognostic impact, suggesting that the higher the mutation prevalence in a population, the lower its discriminative prognostic power. Funnel plot inspection and Egger's tests indicated no major publication bias. Overall, these findings confirm that BRAF V600E mutation is associated with an increased risk of nodal metastasis and recurrence in papillary thyroid carcinoma.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Most patients with differentiated thyroid cancer have low-risk disease and excellent prognosis. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression therapy after initial treatment may be unnecessary and potentially harmful for survivors with recurrence-free, low-risk or intermediate-risk thyroid cancer. Little is known about clinician-reported barriers and facilitators to reducing thyroid cancer survivors' thyroid hormone dose with the goal of aiming for TSH in the normal reference range. METHODS: Clinicians from the fields of endocrinology (n=8) and primary care [PCPs] (n=7) were recruited through convenience/snowball sampling to participate in semi-structured focus groups. Data collection and analyses were informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework for behavior change, a valuable integrative framework which can facilitate comprehensive assessment of behavioral determinants in qualitative studies. Deductive coding and inductive thematic analysis were conducted. RESULTS: Participants were majority female (73%) and averaged 14 years in clinical practice (range, 1-22). Barriers and facilitators emerged at the patient-level, clinician-level, and system-level. Key clinician-reported barriers included patient distress/anxiety and misinformation, unclear shared patient survivorship goals and plans between specialties, and clinic visit time constraints. Clinician-reported facilitators included building a trusting relationship, delivery of patient-centered education, and communication and collaboration between specialties to establish shared long-term survivorship plans. CONCLUSIONS: We identified barriers and facilitators to de-escalating TSH suppression therapy in thyroid cancer survivors at multiple levels. Understanding these factors will enable clinicians to provide high-value, patient-centered care in order to reduce overtreatment, patient harm and improve quality of life in thyroid cancer survivors."

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antidiabetic medications to placebo in T2DM patients, focusing on BC outcomes. Database searched included PubMed, Embase (via OVID), Web of Science (Core Collection), Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 20 June 2025. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistic. Subgroup analyses were conducted by drug class ((dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1Ras), sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i), thiazolidinedione (TZD)). Publication bias was assessed via funnel plot. RESULTS: Overall, antidiabetic medications were not significantly associated with an increased or decreased risk of BC (pooled OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.67-1.20; I(2) = 0.0%). Subgroup analyses by drug class also showed no statistically significant associations: DPP-4i (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.67-1.85; I(2) = 0.0%), GLP-1Ras (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.42-1.22; I(2) = 0.0%), and SGLT-2i (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.50-1.24; I(2) = 0.0%). For thiazolidinediones, only one study (pioglitazone) reported an OR of 2.37 (95% CI: 0.91-6.17), which was not statistically significant. Funnel plots suggested no obvious publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that antidiabetic medications, including DPP-4i, GLP-1Ras, and SGLT-2i, are not significantly associated with BC risk in T2DM patients.

Therefore, this work focuses on gene therapy, using the innovative minicircle DNA (mcDNA) vector to protect and express the pri-miR-375 in the cancer cell nucleus, ultimately originating the microRNA-375 (miR-375) in the cytoplasm. This miR-375, initially downregulated in cervical cancer cells, can silence HPV E6/E7 transcripts, thereby negatively regulating the expression of these oncoproteins. METHODS: The mcDNA-pri-miR-375 vector was successfully constructed, biosynthesized in the host cell, extracted, and purified, followed by several in vitro transfection studies in CaSKi cells (HPV16-infected cervical cancer model) to evaluate the mcDNA-pri-miR-375 effect. RESULTS: FITC-stained-mcDNA-pri-miR-375 was present in cancer cell nucleus, confirmed by confocal microscopy. RT-PCR analysis showed a more intense band of miR-375 transcripts, and RT-PCR/ RT-qPCR confirmed that E6/ E7 transcript levels were nearly 80 % diminished 24 h after CaSki cells transfection. Also, western-blot showed a decreased band intensity for E6/ E7 proteins on transfected cells. Proliferation and cell invasion studies demonstrated growth and migration arrest for CaSki cells throughout 72 h. Cell viability study of these cells also revealed a gradual decrease for the same period, while the NHDF cell viability was not affected, indicating specificity towards CaSki. The consequent effect of silencing the E6/ E7 transcripts was also observed through an increase in p53 protein levels (determined by western blot and ELISA) and caspase-3 activity, after 48 h of CaSki cell transfection. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that mcDNA-pri-miR-375 vector has the potential to be further explored in gene therapy for the treatment of HPV-caused cervical cancer."

Transfer RNA-derived fragments (tRFs) fragments have been implicated in tumor progression through diverse regulatory mechanisms. This study examined the diagnostic value and role of tRF-Val-CAC-008 in LSCC. METHODS: Levels of tRF-Val-CAC-008 were quantified in LSCC tissues, plasma, saliva, and cells using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The diagnostic value of tRF-Val-CAC-008 was then assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. LSCC cells were transfected with mimics or inhibitors of tRF-Val-CAC-008, which increased or decreased its level accordingly. Cell proliferation was evaluated using EdU and the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assays. The level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in LSCC cells was measured using an LDH release assay. Pyroptosis-associated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting (WB). RESULTS: tRF-Val-CAC-008 exhibited significantly higher expression levels in LSCC tissues, plasma and saliva. This higher expression correlated with its pro-proliferative effects and suppression of pyroptosis observed in vitro. In LSCC cells, tRF-Val-CAC-008 mimics promoted cell proliferation and reduced LDH secretion. The expression of gasdermin E (GSDME) and caspase-3 proteins was also decreased by tRF-Val-CAC-008 mimics, which in turn regulated pyroptosis. The ROC curves suggest that combined plasma and saliva tRF-Val-CAC-008 can serve as a diagnostic marker to distinguish LSCC patients from healthy participants. CONCLUSIONS: The study concluded that tRF-Val-CAC-008 could act as a diagnostic marker for LSCC; it promotes tumor growth by suppressing pyroptosis and promoting cell proliferation."

    "abstract": "The clinical translation of bacteria-mediated immunotherapy has been hindered by severe systemic toxicity due to off-target bacterial colonization. To address these limitations, we developed a glutathione (GSH)-responsive self-assembling peptide that forms a nanofibrous coating on Salmonella typhimurium, enabling spatiotemporal control over bacterial activity. The peptide binds lipopolysaccharides on the bacterial surface via electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions, forming a stable protective layer that shields immunogenic epitopes. In the reductive tumor microenvironment, elevated GSH levels trigger disulfide bond cleavage, resulting in disassembly of the peptide shell and controlled bacterial release at tumor sites. In vivo, 10 muM and 20 muM peptide coatings enhanced tumor accumulation by ~2.5- and ~ 1.5-fold, respectively, primarily by enhancing tumor retention and reducing pre-targeting immune clearance. This was accompanied by an increase in tumor-infiltrating neutrophils, key effectors in tumor regression. Importantly, this occurred with markedly reduced systemic inflammation and organ toxicity compared with unmodified bacteria. This strategy offers a promising platform for improving the precision and safety of bacterial immunotherapy, advancing its potential for clinical application in cancer treatment."

Building upon previous evidence that MPE acidity drives metabolic plasticity, this study investigates how acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) coordinates PLCG1-dependent macropinocytosis to maintain osimertinib tolerance. METHODS: Primary MPE-derived NSCLC cultures underwent next-generation sequencing to define mutational heterogeneity. Acidic (pH 6.5-6.8) conditions were used to generate osimertinib-induced DTP (Osi-DTP) models. Functional assays assessed viability, invasion, colony formation, autophagy, and macropinocytosis. ASIC3 was silenced using shRNA, followed by Seahorse metabolic analysis. Transcriptomic profiling identified differentially expressed genes. ASIC3-targeted therapeutic interventions were evaluated in vitro and in xenograft models. RESULTS: MPE-derived NSCLC cultures showed substantial genomic diversity, including EGFR exon 19 deletion and T790M mutations. Acid-adapted Osi-DTP cells exhibited EMT-like phenotypes, reduced proliferation, elevated stemness markers, and strong activation of stress-response pathways. ASIC3 was consistently upregulated under acidic conditions and drove PLCG1-mediated macropinocytosis to support nutrient scavenging and survival. ASIC3 knockdown markedly reduced DTP cell viability, invasiveness, colony formation, autophagy, and glycolysis, while inducing a metabolic shift toward oxidative phosphorylation. In vivo, combining an ASIC3 inhibitor with osimertinib significantly delayed tumor progression and improved survival without added toxicity. Clinically, high ASIC3 expression correlated with poor overall survival and increased autophagy-associated markers. CONCLUSION: ASIC3 is a central regulator of acidosis-driven drug persistence in MPE-associated NSCLC, sustaining osimertinib tolerance through PLCG1-dependent macropinocytosis and metabolic reprogramming. Targeting ASIC3 restores TKI sensitivity by disrupting nutrient acquisition, autophagy, and metabolic adaptation, representing a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent or delay EGFR-TKI resistance."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Limited data exist on the safety of biologic agents in psoriasis patients with cancer, leading guidelines to recommend against their use within five years of cancer history. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of biologic therapies in psoriasis patients with active or recent (</=5 years) cancer. METHODS: A surveillance study of 333 cases with psoriasis and active cancer or a recent cancer history. Patients treated with conventional systemic agents served as comparators. Co-primary outcomes included progression- or recurrence-free survival (PFS/RFS) and the incidence of severe infections. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 6 years, progression/recurrence rates per 100 patient-years were 10.7 (biologics) and 10.5 (conventional). The cumulative 1-year PFS/RFS was 86% in both groups (p=0.89). Overall, biologics did not affect cancer progression (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.59-1.77; P = .94). Predictors of progression or recurrence included impaired functional status, advanced cancer stage (HR per stage increment, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.21-1.82; P < .001), and higher comorbidity burden. LIMITATIONS: Observational design. CONCLUSIONS: Biologics were safe to use in psoriasis patients with cancer."

    "abstract": "Unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) exhibits substantial heterogeneity and complexity. The landmark LAURA and POLESTAR studies have established a standard therapeutic model involving targeted consolidation therapy with osimertinib or aumolertinib after definitive chemoradiotherapy for NSCLC patients harboring EGFR-sensitive mutations. However, treatment strategies for patients with other driver gene mutations (e.g., ALK fusions, ROS1 rearrangement) still lack robust support from high-level evidence-based medical study. To enhance the standardization of diagnosis and treatment for unresectable stage III driver-positive NSCLC patients, the Radiotherapy Committee of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology convened an expert working group. This group identified common clinical practice issues and conducted an in-depth, problem-oriented analysis of domestic and international guidelines alongside evidence-based medical data. Through multiple rounds of comprehensive discussion and expert voting, this consensus was jointly developed. It provides evidence-based recommendations addressing frequently encountered clinical questions regarding unresectable stage III driver-positive NSCLC, aiming to serve as a key reference for clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is closely associated with the hormonal sensitization that the mammary gland (MG) undergoes. We evaluated the effects of endogenous (E2) and synthetic (EE2) estrogens, commonly used as hormonal therapies during menopause, in a context of a pro-carcinogenic environment of endocrine disruption. This scenario was modeled to mimic the menopausal involution of the MG during aging in the Mongolian gerbil experimental model under previous bisphenol A exposure, during pregnancy and lactation. Our findings revealed significant remodeling of the epithelial compartment, characterized by increased branching density and loss of normal features, including decreased CD117+ luminal cells and loss of E-cadherin expression. Hormonal therapy with E2 or EE2 led to the development of epithelial lesions, characterized by an increase in invasive microcarcinomas and a decrease in basal (p63+alpha-SMA-) and myoepithelial (p63+alpha-SMA+) progenitor cells, contributing to increased neoplastic invasiveness. These changes were orchestrated by overexpression of EZH2 and a decrease in BRCA1, indicating a poor prognosis, especially for EE2. Furthermore, an imbalance between proliferation (PH-H3(+) cells) and apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3) was observed in the MG of females treated with E2 and EE2. Additionally, distinct hormone receptor profiles were identified, with consistent upregulation of ERalpha and concomitant downregulation of ERbeta and PR, particularly in EE2-treated MG. These alterations may contribute to the observed dysregulation of proliferation and apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that estrogenic hormonal therapies promote neoplastic progression of the aging MG previously subjected to endocrine disruption."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Sexual dysfunction after cancer is a common but underrecognized sequelae of breast and gynecologic cancer treatment. Many patients experience symptoms of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), including vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and diminished sexual desire. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive, evidence-based approach to management. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus to identify peer-reviewed studies published within the last 30 years. The search incorporated Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords related to sexual dysfunction and cancer survivorship, including terms such as \"sexual dysfunction,\" \"dyspareunia,\" \"vaginal dryness,\" \"vaginal hormone therapy,\" \"breast cancer survivors,\" and \"low desire.\" METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they examined sexual dysfunction in cancer patients or survivors, were published in English, and addressed either physiological or psychological aspects of sexual health. Articles were excluded if they lacked methodological rigor. An initial screening of titles and abstracts was followed by full-text review to determine relevance and inclusion. TABULATION: Findings were synthesized using thematic analysis, with studies grouped by cancer type, treatment modality, and impact on sexual function. Although no formal quality assessment tool was applied, emphasis was placed on high-impact studies and comprehensive reviews published in reputable journals. INTEGRATION AND RESULTS: Effective management of GSM includes non-hormonal options such as minimizing irritants, vaginal moisturizers, lubricants, the use of dilators, and pelvic floor therapies. Local hormonal therapies may offer relief for select patients depending on the hormone-sensitivity of their cancer diagnosis. For low sexual desire, psychological and pharmacological agents such as bremelanotide and flibanserin have demonstrated efficacy. Vaginal lasers and compounded hormones pose significant risks to these patient populations and should be avoided. Multidisciplinary approaches, incorporating gynecologic, psychological, and oncologic expertise, are essential for optimizing patient outcomes. CONCLUSION: Sexual dysfunction following breast and gynecologic cancer requires individualized, multimodal management. A combination of non-hormonal and hormonal therapies, behavioral interventions, and emerging pharmacologic treatments offers promising avenues for improving sexual health and overall quality of life in survivors. Future research should focus on the effects of specific cancer therapies on sexual health, investigate the role of biological markers and dysfunction, and refine more personalized approaches to care."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity is a common adverse event induced by anti-cancer drugs; however, the information of the correlations in vitro to in vivo regarding GI toxicity is limited. The objective of this study was elucidating the usefulness of animal small intestinal organoids using DS-2087b, a novel epidermal growth factor receptor/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 exon 20 insertion inhibitor. Mice showed no DS-2087b-related GI toxicities up to 100mg/kg in 28-day repeated oral toxicity studies, while monkeys exhibited diarrhea at 10mg/kg, along with histopathological changes including intestinal atrophy/erosion at 30 and 100mg/kg. To clarify the mechanisms involved in interspecies differences, cell viability and transcriptomic analysis were performed using mouse and monkey small intestinal organoids generated from adult stem cells treated with DS-2087b at 0-10,000nM for 3 days. Cell viability in monkey small intestinal organoids treated with DS-2087b at 1000 and 10,000nM was significantly decreased compared to that of mice. In the transcriptomic analysis, expression of stem- and Paneth-cell marker genes was markedly decreased in the monkey small intestinal organoids. In conclusion, the intestinal organoids are valuable in vivo-in vitro translation of drug-induced GI toxicity and the changes in specific cell-type composition induced by DS-2087b may be important factors for contributing the interspecies differences."

    "abstract": "Cancer cachexia is characterized by a significant loss in body weight due to the wasting of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Systemic inflammation has long been associated with cachexia, with various tumor secreted factors shown to correlate with as well as cause tissue wasting. In addition to systemic inflammation, it has become increasingly appreciated that inflammation occurs in specific tissues in cancer cachexia, with tissues such as muscle, adipose, liver and brain being affected. While several studies have shown that this local tissue inflammation contributes to cachexia, there is evidence that some aspects of the inflammatory response may play a protective role to mitigate tissue wasting. Here, we will review the findings on local tissue inflammation in cachexia, comparing the impacts of such inflammation on tissue wasting and cachexia progression overall. Furthermore, we discuss the methods used to mitigate inflammation in various tissues and highlight the outcomes on the cachectic phenotype. Collectively, understanding how inflammation contributes to cachexia in each tissue will ultimately influence how therapies can be designed to treat cachexia while minimizing possible adverse side effects."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accurate toxicity assessment is critical in oncology trials, yet current reporting frameworks such as the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) remain labor-intensive and subject to inter-observer variability. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential to automate extraction and grading of adverse events from clinical notes and patient-reported outcomes (PROs), but their comparative performance and cost-effectiveness remain underexplored. METHODS: We evaluated five off-the-shelf LLMs (Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, and GPT-5) using a rule-augmented few-shot prompting strategy to extract CTCAE-graded gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities from a prospective prostate radiotherapy trial (NCT02874014; n = 55 patients, 8968 toxicity records). Binary and grade-level accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, Cohen's kappa, and computational costs were assessed. RESULTS: All models achieved high binary accuracy (84.6-87.4 %) and moderate grade accuracy (79.1-82.3 %). GPT-4o reached the best binary (87.4 %) and grade (83.5 %) accuracy, while Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated highest sensitivity (74.0 %). Specificity peaked with GPT-4o (96.0 %). Cohen's kappa values indicated moderate agreement (0.552-0.560 for binary; 0.401-0.465 for grades). Costs for the entire extraction varied substantially: Gemini 2.0 Flash delivered competitive accuracy at $0.77 total, whereas Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 exceeded $21. CONCLUSIONS: Off-the-shelf LLMs can extract clinically relevant toxicities with performance approaching human inter-rater reliability, at variable but often negligible costs. While grade-level accuracy remains limited, LLM integration into oncology workflows is feasible, offering scalable, low-cost support for toxicity monitoring and data abstraction in clinical research."

This study investigates the oncolytic potential of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) against OSCC and explores its ability to induce ferroptosis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) highlighted CVB3's efficacy in initiating ferroptosis, placing the pathogen as a hopeful option in cancer treatment. We demonstrated CVB3 infection significantly inhibited OSCC cell proliferation and tumor growth in mouse models. Biochemical tests verified ferroptosis activation, marked by increased Fe(2+), lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, alongside decreased glutathione (GSH). These effects were reversed by ferroptosis inhibitors. Mechanistically, CVB3 downregulated circ_0010074 and its target Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), while upregulating miR-214-3p. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and luciferase assays, we found circ_0010074 sequesters miR-214-3p to regulate GPX4 expression. Our research demonstrates that CVB3 acts as a highly effective oncolytic virus in targeting OSCC, inducing ferroptosis via the previously unrecognized circ_0010074/miR-214-3p/GPX4 pathway. This discovery opens new doors for treating this particularly aggressive form of cancer, offering a potentially groundbreaking therapeutic approach."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Breast cancer poses a global burden on individuals and healthcare systems, with millions of women undergoing surgery annually. Recently, there has been growing recognition of the importance of patient-centered care, leading to increased interest in Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs). In oncology, this has translated into the use of validated tools such as the BREAST-Q survey, which is designed for a range of breast surgery procedures, and it is specifically applicable in breast cancer. Using BREAST-Q data collected at the University Hospital of Pisa (Italy) between 2018 and 2022 from a sample of 482 women, this study explores the causal relationship between the pre-operative information provided by the breast surgeon and patients' post-surgery satisfaction. METHODS: We employ Item Response Theory models to estimate patient-level satisfaction with pre-surgery information and with breast outcomes. Using these estimated latent traits, we assess the causal effect of satisfaction with pre-surgery information on post-surgery breast satisfaction through an exposure-response curve, accounting for various pre-exposure individual characteristics. RESULTS: Findings show a strong, positive, and statistically significant causal relationship between pre-operative information and post-operative satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: In a healthcare landscape increasingly constrained by time and resources, healthcare organizations should note the causal link between communication and patient-reported outcomes and strive to create environments that support meaningful patient-centered interactions."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Regulated cell death (RCD) is essential for organismal development, as it plays key roles in organ formation, pathogen defense, and the maintenance of homeostasis. However, while RCD subroutines-such as apoptosis, autophagy, pyroptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis-are fundamental for health, their dysregulation can be detrimental, potentially triggering or contributing to a variety of diseases. As a result, the modulation of RCD has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for numerous conditions, including infectious, neurodegenerative, autoimmune, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Over the past two decades, innovative experimental approaches for modulating RCD have proliferated in medicinal research. In parallel, a growing array of online resources-such as databases, web servers, machine learning (ML) /artificial intelligence (AI) models, omics technologies, and systems biology networks, collectively referred to as \"in silico methods\"-has become available to accelerate research progress. AIM OF REVIEW: Recognizing the potential of these online resources, we have compiled a comprehensive overview of relevant in silico approaches to RCD, aiming to facilitate their effective use in the development of future therapeutic interventions. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: RCD-associated databases serve as the foundational data infrastructure for in silico methods, encompassing extensive biological information spanning DNA, RNA, proteins, small molecules, and disease-related data. The continuous curation and expansion of these databases are crucial for elucidating various cell death modalities and visually characterizing the functional dynamics of target molecules across different pathological conditions. Through the integration of AI, ML, multi-omics technologies, and systems biology approaches, we can systematically decode the intricate regulatory networks of RCD and disease progression patterns. This interdisciplinary convergence significantly enhances the discovery pipeline for disease-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets."

    "abstract": "Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators in cancer progression, yet their mechanistic roles in gastric cancer (GC) remain poorly understood. Here, we identify SNORA21 as an oncogenic snoRNA that drives GC pathogenesis through P53 pathway inactivation. We demonstrated significant SNORA21 upregulation in GC tissues and cell lines compared to normal controls. Functional studies revealed that SNORA21 knockdown inhibited tumor growth, while its overexpression promoted malignant phenotypes, establishing its crucial role in determining GC cell fate. Transcriptomic profiling and mechanistic investigations uncovered that SNORA21 represses P53 tumor suppressor activity through a novel CHK1-dependent mechanism. Specifically, SNORA21 attenuated DNA damage responses by inhibiting CHK1 phosphorylation, thereby preventing P53 activation. Remarkably, SNORA21 depletion triggered PERP induction - a P53 effector - which formed a positive feedback loop by suppressing MDM2-mediated P53 degradation. This dual regulatory mechanism (CHK1 inhibition and PERP-MDM2 feedback) explains how SNORA21 sustains P53 inactivation in GC cells. In vivo xenograft models confirmed that SNORA21 silencing suppressed tumor growth while enhancing P53 signaling activity. Our work not only elucidates SNORA21 as a master regulator of the P53 pathway in GC but also reveals its therapeutic potential. The discovery of the SNORA21-CHK1-PERP-MDM2 axis provides a conceptual framework for targeting snoRNA-mediated P53 regulation in GC treatment. These findings position SNORA21 as both a prognostic biomarker and a candidate for RNA-based therapeutics in P53-wildtype gastric cancers."

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Aberrant canonical Wnt signaling is a hallmark of this cancer type. It has been reported that LPA is a bioactive lipid that plays different roles in colon cancer by activating its G-protein-coupled receptors, promoting cell proliferation, migration, survival, and angiogenesis. Although it has been reported that LPA activates canonical Wnt signaling, the mechanisms underlying their interaction remain unclear; this study aims to investigate them. As previously reported, LPA receptor expression changes under malignant conditions: while LPA(1) is expressed at high levels and LPA(2) is low in non-malignant 112CoN cells, the opposite occurs in malignant cells, with colon cancer cells showing low LPA(1) levels and high LPA(2) levels. We also observed that both LPA and Wnt-3a induce strong ERK activation in all colon cell lines; these effects are not additive. Additionally, LPA and Wnt-3a stimulate beta-catenin transcriptional activity and its phosphorylation at residues S552 and S675, again in a non-additive manner. We further found that LPA(2) and the Wnt effectors Dvl2 and Dvl3 co-precipitate in colon cancer cells, and that the PDZ-interacting motif in the carboxyl terminus of the LPA(2) receptor is critical for their direct interaction. Moreover, expressing a mutated LPA(2-)PDZminus receptor inhibited cell migration while increasing proliferation. Remarkably, the LPA(2-)PDZminus receptor negatively affected its ability to activate canonical Wnt signaling and unexpectedly, it also impaired the Wnt-3a ligand-induced activation of canonical Wnt signaling in colon cancer cells."

The progression of tumors driven by chemo-radiotherapy resistance is the primary determinant of poor clinical outcomes, highlighting the crucial need for mechanistic insights into resistance pathways. In this study, we uncover that Lysine Acetyltransferase 7 (KAT7) overexpression not only promotes non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo but also confers resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which has been previously underexplored in NSCLC. Mechanistically, KAT7 forms a positive feedback loop with long non-coding RNA PVT1 (lncPVT1) and regulates the H3K14ac/HDGF axis and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which the mutual regulation of KAT7, lncPVT1, and HDGF drives the proliferation and chemo-radiotherapy resistance of NSCLC."

In this study, semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi-IPN) hydrogels composed of collagen (C), polyurethane (PU), and maltodextrin (MD) were synthesized to investigate the influence of MD content (0-50 wt%) on their physicochemical and biological performance. The hydrogels exhibited an amorphous morphology with embedded MD granules, enhanced swelling capacity (up to 1100 %), and reduced crosslinking density at higher MD contents. Formulations containing 20-30 wt% MD demonstrated improved mechanical strength (G' = 267 Pa), higher thermal stability, and slower degradation under pH 5.5, pH 7.4, and simulated body fluid conditions. Increasing MD concentrations (30-50 wt%) promoted the metabolic activity of monocytes, fibroblasts, and bone-derived cells (up to 130-150 % relative to control), while exerting antiproliferative effects against colon cancer cells (notably at 40 wt% MD, with 56 % of viability). The CPU-MD30 hydrogel stimulated IL-10 secretion, whereas 10 wt% MD maintained baseline MCP-1 levels. Hydrogels exhibited excellent hemocompatibility and antibacterial activity, inhibiting E. coli by 93 % and S. aureus by 58 %, likely arising from oxidized maltodextrin byproducts and polyurethane segments that disrupt bacterial membranes. Drug release assays confirmed pH-sensitive release profiles for ketorolac and methylene blue. Hydrogels with higher MD content accelerated in vitro wound closure (by up to 15 days) and promoted surface mineralization by forming carbonated hydroxyapatite, confirming their osteoconductive potential. These CPU-MD hydrogels demonstrate strong potential as bioactive scaffolds for soft- and hard-tissue regeneration, immunomodulation, controlled drug delivery, and selective cancer therapy."

Despite substantial advancements in cancer research, the escalating incidence and mortality rates underscore the persistent and growing burden on global healthcare systems. The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas system, heralded as a revolutionary gene-editing tool, holds immense promise for cancer treatment. However, its efficacy is critically contingent upon developing efficient delivery strategies. DNA nanocarriers, characterized by their programmability, sequence specificity, and design flexibility, emerge as a highly effective vehicle for delivering the CRISPR/Cas system, facilitating the precise transportation of gene-editing tools to the cell nucleus. The integration of DNA nanocarriers with CRISPR/Cas technology provides a new paradigm for precise and controllable gene editing. Through programmable spatial assembly, DNA nanocarriers can protect Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexs (RNPs), facilitate endosomal escape, and co-localize donor DNA to promote homology-directed repair. These synergistic effects bridge molecular programmability and genetic functionality, paving the way for safer and more efficient genome engineering. This review aims to evaluate the application of DNA nanocarriers in cancer diagnosis comprehensively and to explore their potential utility in cancer therapy when combined with the CRISPR/Cas system, offering novel insights and significant scientific contributions to the field."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its efficacy remains limited. Recent studies demonstrate that resistance to ferroptosis is a significant barrier to the success of ICB. METHODS: Ferroptosis was assessed by measuring C11-BODIPY fluorescence and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) staining. Epigenetic regulation of hepcidin under fatty acid-rich conditions in HCC cells was investigated through chromatin immunoprecipitation and histone methylation analyses. Clinical relevance was evaluated using ICB response datasets and analyses of tumor tissues from HCC patients. RESULTS: We demonstrate that prolonged exposure to high palmitate concentrations induces ferroptosis resistance in HCC cells by altering glutamine availability. Mechanistically, chronic exposure to palmitate and high-fat diet-feeding reduced glutamine-derived alpha-KG concentrations in HCC cells, leading to a H3K27me3-mediated reduction in hepcidin and depletion of the intracellular labile iron pool, thereby promoting resistance to anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1)-induced ferroptosis. This resistance was reversed by the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat, which epigenetically restored hepcidin expression in both in vitro and in vivo models. Notably, tumor tissues from HCC patients exhibited high FFA levels, along with low levels of glutamine, hepcidin, and iron, which correlated with shorter overall survival. H3K27me3-mediated suppression of hepcidin was further confirmed in patient cohorts. CONCLUSION: Our study uncovers a previously unrecognized type of palmitate-induced metabolic reprogramming that confers resistance to ICB-induced ferroptosis on HCC, and propose a therapeutic strategy to overcome ferroptosis resistance under free fatty acid-rich conditions."

    "abstract": "Exosomes are nanoscale extracellular vesicles that mediate critical intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent advancements reveal that exosome populations within tumors are not uniform but exhibit significant heterogeneity in their molecular cargo and functional output. This heterogeneity is particularly pronounced in spatially organized tumors, where distinct functional zones, driven by gradients in local stress, perfusion, and metabolic states, orchestrate the release of unique exosome subtypes. These functional zones include stromal, hypoxic, perivascular, quiescent, and immune-cold regions. The zone-specific exosomes deliver specialized molecular cargos, including nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and metabolites, to recipient cells within the TME and at distant sites. This communication promotes tumor sustenance and contributes to drug resistance through diverse mechanisms, such as immune suppression, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), metabolic reprogramming, and the activation of prosurvival signaling pathways. Although bulk exosome analysis has enabled the development of biomarkers for personalized medicine, it often fails to capture these intricate, zone-specific influences. This review explores emerging techniques, including single-cell sequencing, microchip-based 3D tumor cultures, advanced spectroscopic methods, and spatial biology platforms, that are poised to elucidate the spatiotemporal communication networks mediated by zonal exosomes, thereby advancing the understanding of drug resistance mechanisms."

METHODS: We utilized the LexisNexis Database to retrospectively analyze prostate biopsy malpractice lawsuits. We searched for keywords \"prostate\", \"malpractice\", and \"biopsy\" from January 1, 1995 to March 30, 2025. We focused on cases where the allegation of malpractice was specific to the biopsy, excluding cases addressing other aspects of prostate cancer care. We then reviewed case characteristics including type of biopsy, location, instigating injuries, allegations, verdict, and plaintiff award. RESULTS: We found 360 unique lawsuits, 24 of which met the inclusion criteria. 9 lawsuits involved transrectal prostate biopsy, while the rest were unspecified types. Out of the 47 instigating injuries named, the most common were infection (9/47), acute or chronic pain after biopsy (6/47), and erectile dysfunction (4/47), LUTS (4/47), and bleeding (4/47). 18 cases (75.0%) resulted in defendant verdict, while 1 (4%) resulted in plaintiff verdict with an award of $226,795.00. 1 case (4%) resulted in private settlement of unknown amount. 2 lawsuits (8%) were ongoing at the time of the study, and 2 (8%) had undocumented verdicts. CONCLUSIONS: Despite wide utilization of prostate biopsy in the past 30 years, prostate biopsy lawsuits were rare at the federal and state court levels. Majority of the cases arose from common injuries after biopsies, and most cases resulted in the favor of the defending physicians."

    "abstract": "Hypoxia plays a crucial role in the advancement of colorectal cancer (CRC); however, the downstream mechanisms facilitated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) remain incompletely understood. This study employed in vitro and in vivo models to investigate the role of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) under hypoxic conditions in CRC. Utilizing reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis, we observed an upregulation of TCF7L2 mRNA and protein expression in Caco-2 and HCT-116 CRC cell lines under hypoxia. Functional assays, including CCK-8, colony and sphere formation, Transwell, flow cytometry, and xenograft tumor models, provided evidence that the knockdown of TCF7L2 leads to the suppression of CRC cell proliferation, the induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, and a decrease in migration and invasion capabilities. Furthermore, it inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSC) characteristics in vitro, while also reducing tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays have elucidated that the expression of TCF7L2 induced by hypoxia is dependent on HIF-1alpha, which directly binds to hypoxia response elements (HREs) within the TCF7L2 promoter. Additionally, Western blot and experiments employing the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 have demonstrated that TCF7L2 activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thereby facilitating the proliferation of CRC cells. A clinical analysis of 104 CRC specimens, utilizing immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RT-qPCR, revealed that elevated expression levels of TCF7L2 were significantly associated with advanced T stage, metastasis, and unfavorable prognosis. Spearman correlation analysis confirmed a positive relationship between the expressions of TCF7L2 and HIF-1alpha, while Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that their co-expression was predictive of reduced overall survival. Collectively,these findings position TCF7L2 as a critical downstream effector of HIF-1alpha in hypoxic CRC, and its mechanistic role in promoting malignancy and correlation with poor prognosis provide a theoretical basis for exploring TCF7L2 as a potential therapeutic target in future studies.."

Participants were aged 16 years or older (16-17-year-olds included from January, 2022). Nicotine pouch use was self-reported through questions on current use of various nicotine and tobacco products. We estimated trends in the prevalence of current nicotine pouch use, overall and stratified by sociodemographic characteristics and other nicotine product use, as well as trends in the use of pouches to aid quitting smoking. All reported percentages are survey-weighted. FINDINGS: A total of 127 793 individuals were included in this study. Among adults, nicotine pouch use increased from 0.1% (95% CI 0.1-0.2) in October, 2020, to 1.0% (0.8-1.2) in March, 2025. From 2022, increases were concentrated among young people: in 16-24-year-olds, use rose from 0.7% (0.4-1.4) in January, 2022, to 4.0% (2.9-5.5) in March, 2025, with no meaningful change in those aged 35 years and older. Use was higher among men, especially 16-24-year-old men (7.5%, 6.0-9.4 in March, 2025) and those who smoke or vape, but similar across nations and social grades. Among people using pouches surveyed from January, 2022, to March, 2025, 69% (95% CI 65-74) also used other nicotine products; 56% (52-61) smoked, 39% (34-44) vaped, and 16% (12-19) had never smoked regularly. Among people who attempted to quit smoking in the past year, the proportion using pouches in their most recent quit attempt rose from 2.6% (1.0-6.6) in October, 2020, to 6.5% (4.8-8.8) in March, 2025. INTERPRETATION: Nicotine pouch use has risen in Great Britain, primarily driven by sharp increases among young people, especially young men. Most users also smoked or vaped, and a growing proportion of smokers used pouches in attempts to quit smoking. These findings underscore the importance of implementing age-of-sale legislation for nicotine pouches and conducting research on their effectiveness for smoking cessation.

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer poses a substantial clinical challenge and accounts for a large proportion of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The therapeutic landscape has undergone a large transformation in the past 5 years, resulting in improved patient outcomes. In this Seminar, we review the pathology, diagnostic strategies, and treatments for prostate cancer. Active surveillance is the preferred treatment option for patients with indolent prostate cancer. For those requiring treatment, local therapies provide effective cancer control. Systemic treatment is essential for advanced and metastatic cases, and a wide range of therapies are now available, including androgen deprivation therapy, chemotherapy, and emerging targeted agents such as lutetium-177-labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen radioligand therapy and PARP inhibitors. Considering toxicity profiles alongside patient preferences is important to facilitating shared decision making. Further research is needed to establish the most effective sequence and combination of treatments for metastatic prostate cancer."

    "abstract": "Lacticaseibacillus paracasei strain Shirota (LcS), promotes intestinal homeostasis, modulates immune cells, and provides anti-stress benefits. Four years of BLP (Biolactis powder: LcS preparation) administration is known to suppress the recurrence of highly dysmorphic polyps in participants who underwent colorectal adenoma resection. Furthermore, adenoma development tended to be suppressed in patients undergoing colorectal adenoma resection who consumed BLP for >20 years, accompanied by a reduction in aging weight loss. However, the underlying mechanisms and effects of prolonged BLP intake on gut mucosa and microbiota remain unclear. Hence, we aimed to analyse the gut microbiota and host gene expression in endoscopically obtained colonic mucosal tissue from participants who had been voluntarily consuming BLP for more than 20 years, as well as from non-consumers of BLP. The faecal and mucosal microbiota of the BLP group revealed a high detection rate and abundance of Coprococcus genus and a rich population of butyrate-producing bacteria. Conversely, the mucosa of the control group was enriched in opportunistic pathogens and environmental bacteria, including those from the families Pseudomonadaceae and Brachyspiraceae. RNA-seq of the colon mucosa of BLP-consuming patients revealed high expression of genes related to the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway, including those of the mitochondrial electron transfer system. Additionally, T cell- and G-protein-coupled receptor-related genes were overexpressed in BLP-consuming patients. These findings indicate that prolonged BLP intake increases the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria and activates the OXPHOS pathway in colonic mucosal tissue, which alters the enteroenvironment and limits colonisation by opportunistic pathogens. These findings may contribute to the prevention of colorectal cancer development and have implications for promoting healthy longevity. Clinical Trial Registry number: 000025389."

    "abstract": "This study explores the role of efferocytosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) using single-cell RNA sequencing and in vitro/in vivo assays. Analyzing 27 samples from 9 patients with ESCC, we identify diverse cell types and significant heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment, with a focus on efferocytosis. Our findings highlight that macrophages engulf apoptotic tumor cells, thereby impairing immune responses and promoting tumor progression. Notably, TP63 and RAC2 emerge as key regulators of this process, influencing efferocytosis and immune modulation. Functional assays demonstrate that disrupting these pathways alters macrophage efferocytosis and impacts tumor growth in vivo. These results suggest that targeting efferocytosis pathways offers potential therapeutic strategies for ESCC, enhancing antitumor immunity and improving patient outcomes. The study underscores the complex interactions between tumor cells and the immune system, with efferocytosis representing a promising therapeutic target."

    "abstract": "Inducing lipid peroxidation-dependent ferroptosis is a promising anticancer strategy; however, the development of resistance poses a considerable challenge. This study identifies peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) as a crucial modulator of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), affecting its localization and functional roles, thus contributing to ferroptosis resistance. PRDX6, endowed with phospholipase A2 activity, catalyzes the conversion of peroxy-phospholipids to lysophospholipids and oxidized fatty acids. Through targeted structural mutations and biochemical analyses, we demonstrate that PRDX6 binds to GPX4 via a C47 disulfide bond, facilitating GPX4's membrane translocation and enhanced production of hydroxy fatty acids. Combining the inhibition of PRDX6 with ferroptosis inducers increases lipid peroxidation, effectively suppressing tumor growth in liver and ovarian cancer mouse models, including patient-derived models. Furthermore, high PRDX6 expression correlates with shorter progression-free survival across multiple human cancer types. Collectively, our findings delineate a PRDX6-dependent mechanism in ferroptosis defense, offering new perspectives for targeted cancer therapy."

    "abstract": "Combining multiple biomarkers can considerably improve diagnostic accuracy compared to testing individually. Herein, we fabricated an AND logic gate biosensor responsive to stimuli based on a highly integrated DNAzyme sensing probe and the MnO(2) nanosheets nanocarrier to improve the sensitivity and specificity of cancer cell detection. Human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) and microRNA (miRNA) act as two \"input\" biomarkers to execute AND logic gate operation. Logical target recognition, signal transduction and amplification module are integrated into one allosteric DNAzyme probe by target-induced transformation from its locked conformation to active structure, which greatly facilitate the sensing progress. The MnO(2) nanosheets serve as the stimuli-responsive nanocarrier, which can only release the loaded sensing probes and cofactor Mn(2+) for DNAzyme cleavage after being decomposed by glutathione (GSH). Due to selective release and precise logic operation of the integrated DNAzyme probe, only target cancer cells can exhibit relatively strong fluorescence signal by the specific response of APE1 and miR-222. The proposed logic gate biosensor could not only perform accurate analysis of target cancer cells with high discrimination ratio from normal cells, but also enable visualized detection of miR-222 expression differences in different cancer cell types. This strategy will promote the development of simple and effective biosensors and provide a potential tool for cancer diagnosis and the related biomedical application."

    "abstract": "USP7 has been reported to promote cancer progression through removing ubiquitin from various substrates, making it a target for cancer therapy. To now, several USP7 proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have been reported, and USP7 inhibitors used in USP7 PROTACs all feature tert-hydroxypiperidinol scaffold. In this study, we firstly designed and synthesized a panel of novel USP7 PROTACs with USP7 inhibitor containing thienopyridine, and identified D16 as a potent and selective USP7 degrader. Mechanistic investigation with specific inhibitors revealed that D16 induced USP7 degradation by binding to USP7 and E3 ligase CRBN. Proteomics analysis showed that D16 selectively decreased the expression of USP7 rather than other USPs. Moreover, treatment of D16 suppressed cell migration of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer cells with minor anti-proliferative activity. Our findings highlight that D16 may support as a promising lead compound for metastatic UGI cancer treatment."

We present LHQ766, a novel orally bioavailable FGFR2 inhibitor demonstrating exceptional potency and selectivity, through optimization of our previously reported FGFR2 inhibitor 7. The structures and purity of all target compounds were confirmed by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, HRMS and HPLC analyses. Compound LHQ766 exhibited strong enzymatic inhibition (IC(50) = 7.3 nM against FGFR2), good kinase selectivity (selective over FGFR1/3/4 and 72 other tyrosine kinases), and remarkable cellular potency (IC(50) = 0.5 nM in BaF3-FGFR2 cells). Mechanistic studies through computational modeling and mass spectrometry revealed LHQ766's covalent binding mode with FGFR2. The compound demonstrated dose-dependent suppression of FGFR2 signaling pathways and selective anti-proliferative effects in FGFR2-driven cancer models. As a key advancement over lead compound 7, LHQ766 showed substantially optimized pharmacokinetic properties, achieving 35.9 % oral bioavailability in rats. These findings positioned LHQ766 as a promising lead compound for targeted FGFR2 therapy."

Peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) have emerged as a promising class of targeted therapeutics designed to overcome this limitation. A typical PDC comprises three key components: a tumor-homing peptide, a chemical linker, and a cytotoxic or therapeutic payload. This structure enables precise drug delivery to tumor sites, enhancing antitumor efficacy while minimizing damage to healthy tissues. In this review, we describe the structure and key constituents of PDCs, along with the functions of their individual components. Moreover, we summarize recent advances in the development of PDCs, with a focus on their target selection, design strategies, and anticancer applications. Notably, we also introduce emerging PROTAC-based PDCs, highlighting this innovative landscape in targeted protein degradation. Additionally, we discuss the current challenges and propose potential solutions for the future development of PDCs."

    "abstract": "Altered drug pharmacokinetics during inflammation or infection have been linked to elevated plasma concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines. Data on how these cytokines affect the expression and activity of intestinal drug transporters and, therefore, bioavailability of transported drugs, remain limited. Here, we used a novel human enteroid in vitro model to investigate the effects of key proinflammatory cytokines (ie, interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma) on the mRNA expression of major intestinal transporters and activity of intestinal breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Differentiated enteroid monolayers (in 96-well plates) were treated for 48 hours with each cytokine individually or in combination (cocktail) at 0.1, 1, or 10 ng/mL, encompassing their pathophysiological plasma concentrations in various inflammatory conditions. In a concentration-dependent manner, the cytokine cocktail significantly reduced the mRNA expression of BCRP, P-gp, multidrug resistance proteins 2/3, organic solute transporter alpha/beta, serotonin transporter, and organic anion transporter polypeptide 2B1, while increasing multidrug resistance protein4 mRNA expression. Among individual cytokines, IL-1beta elicited the most pronounced effects. To quantify the effect of cytokines on mRNA expression and activity of BCRP and P-gp, these treatments, at 1 ng/mL of individual cytokines or the cocktail, were repeated in the Transwell format. The efflux ratio of nitrofurantoin (a selective BCRP substrate), after exposure to 1 ng/mL of each cytokine or the cytokine cocktail for 48 hours, was significantly reduced, whereas the efflux ratio of digoxin (a P-gp substrate) remained unchanged. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Proinflammatory cytokines significantly downregulate major intestinal drug transporter expression and breast cancer resistance protein activity in human enteroid monolayers, highlighting the potential impact of inflammation on oral drug bioavailability. These results can be used to populate physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models to predict transporter-mediated drug absorption under inflammatory conditions, guiding safer and more effective dosing regimens."

    "abstract": "Epimedium Herba (EH) demonstrates significant therapeutic potential against prostate cancer (PC), though its mechanisms of action remain incompletely understood. This study investigates the pharmacological mechanisms of EH in treating PC through network pharmacology analysis and experimental validation. Active components and potential targets of EH were identified using network pharmacology from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). The STRING database facilitated the construction of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for shared targets and the identification of core anti-PC targets. Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein expression of core target genes in normal prostate and PC tissues, along with their correlation to overall PC survival, were analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed on the potential targets. Molecular docking of quercetin with key targets (TP53, TNF, heat shock protein 90 alpha family class A member 1 (HSP90AA1), AKT1, CASP3, and ESR1) was conducted, with results visualized using PyMOL. In vitro experiments validated the network pharmacology predictions. Twenty-three active ingredients of EH were identified, and the intersection of potential targets with PC targets yielded 183 potential targets. PPI network analysis revealed six key genes: targets (TP53), TNF, HSP90AA1, AKT1, CASP3, and ESR1. GO enrichment analysis identified 2369 biological processes (BP), 77 cellular components (CC), and 215 molecular functions (MF). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that EH's anti-cancer effects were mediated through interleukin-17 (IL-17), TNF, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT, apoptosis, p53, HIF-1, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance pathways. Core target validation confirmed consistency with the study's findings. Molecular docking indicated stable binding between the six core targets and quercetin. In vitro experiments confirmed quercetin's inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis in ACT-1 cells. This investigation identifies potential therapeutic targets for PC through network pharmacology and experimental validation."

This review elucidates the transformative potential of hafnium (Hf)-based radiosensitizers in overcoming these challenges. Leveraging Hf's high atomic number, these Hf-based biomaterials enhance X-ray energy deposition through photoelectric and Auger effects, generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), and modulate immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments to enhance radiotherapy effect. Their distinctive capability to achieve multimodal synergy by integrating radiotherapy with photodynamic, chemotherapeutic, or immunotherapeutic strategies enables precise targeting and significantly enhances antitumor responses. Subsequently, this review rigorously assessed the current synthetic methodologies for Hf-based radiosensitizers, along with their capacities and limitations in terms of controlling material properties and ensuring scalability. Advanced imaging modalities such as fluorescence, CT, SPECT, MRI, and PA further establish Hf-based systems as theranostic platforms for real-time tumor localization and treatment monitoring. While clinical candidates like NBTXR3 exhibit promising trial outcomes, challenges remain in mechanistic clarification, biocompatibility optimization, and controlled in vivo degradation. Emerging AI-driven design and multidisciplinary integration hold promise to expedite clinical translation, advancing Hf-based radiosensitizers toward intelligent, personalized cancer therapy paradigms. This work highlights Hf's critical role in redefining precision radiotherapy and delineates a roadmap for next-generation oncological intervention."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prostate diseases, including prostatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prostate cancer (PCa), are common in men and involve complex pathogenesis. Increasing evidence suggests that pathogen infections may influence prostate disease development through immune activation and chronic inflammation. However, causal relationships remain unclear. METHODS: We conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) and Bayesian weighted MR (BWMR) analyses to investigate the causal association between pathogen-specific antibody levels and prostate disease risk. Genetic data for pathogen antibodies were obtained from the UK Biobank, and GWAS summary statistics for prostatitis, BPH, and PCa were sourced from large public databases. Multiple sensitivity analyses were performed to validate the robustness of the findings. RESULTS: Positive levels of herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) mgG-1, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBNA-1, and human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) IE1B antibodies were associated with an increased risk of prostatitis, whereas EBV ZEBRA and HHV-7 U14 antibodies were protective. For PCa, HHV-6 E1A antibodies were risk factors, while HHV-7 IgG and Helicobacter pylori VacA antibodies exhibited protective effects. In BPH, EBV VCA p18, HSV-2 IgG, and Helicobacter pylori IgG antibodies increased risk, whereas Helicobacter pylori peroxidase, OMP, and EBV ZEBRA antibodies showed protective associations. No evidence of reverse causality was found. CONCLUSION: This study provides genetic evidence supporting a potential causal role of specific pathogen infections in the development of prostate diseases. Targeted prevention of certain infections may contribute to reducing prostate disease risk. Future studies are warranted to validate these findings across diverse populations and to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms."

This review synthesizes recent advances in elucidating USP10's mechanistic roles in modulating oncogenic signaling, tumor immunity, and therapeutic resistance, with a central focus on its paradoxical dual regulation. USP10 stabilizes tumor-promoting substrates to drive the malignant phenotypes, while also exerting tumor-suppressive effects. Clinically, USP10 overexpression correlates with aggressive phenotypes and poor prognosis. Therapeutically, USP10 inhibition synergizes with Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), effectively suppressing tumor growth in preclinical models. Key challenges include resolving USP10's functional dichotomy across BC subtypes, developing isoform-selective inhibitors, and overcoming resistance mechanisms. Future directions emphasize spatial proteomics to map USP10 interactomes in metastatic niches and genetically engineered models for validating synthetic lethality approaches. Collectively, USP10 represents a promising therapeutic target in BC. Its complex, context-dependent role underscores the need for targeted strategies to exploit its functions for precision oncology."

The specific mechanisms driving this cardiotoxicity are not fully understood but can include the induction of oxidative stress and subsequent cell death mechanism activation. This has prompted the exploration of NRF2, a master co-ordinator of antioxidant and largely cytoprotective pathways, as a potential approach for the alleviation of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Here, NRF2 was pharmacologically activated via CDDO-Me (hitherto referred to as CDDO) to reduce the negative consequences on AC16 human cardiomyocyte cell health and functions. NRF2 intracellular dynamics were quantitatively measured using live-cell imaging, demonstrating rapid ( approximately 10 min) yet sustained (>/=24 h) induction of NRF2 expression and functional downstream activity. Genetic perturbations of the NRF2-KEAP1 system highlight that CDDO acts specifically through NRF2 to exert AC16 cytoprotection from DOX whilst not promoting human lung and pancreatic cancer cell line viability. RNA-seq analysis was also utilised to highlight the molecular mechanisms underpinning the effects DOX in AC16 cells and the CDDO-mediated mitigation of cardiotoxicity. This study provides novel insight into NRF2 dynamics in the widely utilised AC16 cells whilst further elucidating the molecular mechanisms contributing to DOX cardiotoxicity and potential NRF2-orchestrated defence."

Salvage surgery with reconstruction for patients with a history of reconstructive surgery and radiation therapy (RT) is especially difficult and carries a high risk of complications. METHODS: This study included patients with RMHNC who had a history of reconstructive surgery and RT. The prognosis and complications were evaluated by dividing patients into those who underwent salvage surgery with reconstruction and those who underwent non-surgical treatments. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were enrolled. The overall survival (OS) of the salvage surgery with reconstruction group was better than that of the non-surgical treatment groups (median OS; 50.6 months vs. 21.6 months, p = 0.0373), but the progression-free survival (PFS) was similar (median PFS; 14.5 months vs. 12.9 months, p = 0.48). The salvage surgery with reconstruction group also showed a better prognosis than the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) group (median OS; 50.6 months vs. 30.9 months, p = 0.209). In the salvage surgery with reconstruction group, 85.8 % of cases experienced postoperative complications, while in the patients who underwent non-surgical treatments, 58.8 % experienced adverse events (p = 0.0724). There were no cases of Grade IIIb or higher that required general anesthesia. CONCLUSION: Salvage surgery with reconstruction showed a better prognosis than other non-surgical treatments, including ICI. Furthermore, with careful case selection and thorough postoperative care, salvage surgery with reconstruction can be performed relatively safely without any serious complications."

This exploratory randomized controlled trial evaluated whether a perioperative multicomponent behavioral program targeting circadian and gut-brain processes was associated with improvements in neuroimmune profiles and symptom outcomes. METHODS: A total of 184 patients with stage I-III low rectal cancer undergoing ultra-low anterior resection were randomized to receive either standard ERAS care or an integrative perioperative intervention that combined emotion-regulation strategies (mindfulness-based stress reduction, heart-rate-variability biofeedback, neurofeedback) with structured sleep and circadian therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, controlled-release melatonin, circadian scheduling). Co-primary outcomes were depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-II) and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha), gastrointestinal recovery indices, and skeletal muscle index (SMI). Disease-free and overall survival were examined as pre-specified exploratory endpoints. RESULTS: Compared with standard care, the integrative intervention was associated with greater 6-month improvements in depressive symptoms and sleep quality (both p < 0.01), lower postoperative inflammation (e.g., POD7 interleukin-6: 39.7 vs 52.3 pg/mL; p < 0.001), and faster gastrointestinal recovery. Preservation of SMI at 12 months was associated with improved disease-free survival (hazard ratio 0.51, 95 % CI 0.29-0.92; p = 0.027). Two-year disease-free survival showed an exploratory signal favoring the intervention (89.7 % vs 74.0 %; hazard ratio 0.46, 95 % CI 0.23-0.93), although survival analyses were not powered for definitive inference. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative modulation of circadian and gut-brain processes was associated with improvements in depressive symptoms, sleep quality, postoperative inflammatory profiles, and functional recovery. Survival findings represent preliminary exploratory signals and require confirmation in larger, adequately powered randomized trials."

    "abstract": "The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase Stimulator of Interferon Genes (cGAS-STING) pathway is a key component of innate immunity, detecting cytosolic DNA and initiating type I interferon (IFN-I) responses that shape downstream adaptive immunity. Owing to its central role in antiviral defense, tumor immunosurveillance, and inflammatory regulation, STING has emerged as a promising therapeutic target across oncology, infectious diseases, neuroinflammation, and autoimmune disorders. However, the clinical translation of STING agonists and antagonists is constrained by poor pharmacokinetics, rapid systemic clearance, off-target cytokine release, and inefficient cytosolic delivery. To address these barriers, a diverse set of delivery technologies including lipid nanoparticles, polymeric carriers, inorganic nanomaterials, hydrogels, biologically derived vectors, and antibody STING conjugates has been developed to improve selective uptake, endosomal escape, pHarmacological stability, and tissue-specific accumulation. This review systematically examines these platforms, highlighting their mechanisms, immunological effects, advantages, limitations, and stages of clinical progression. Emerging innovations such as stimuli-responsive delivery systems, mRNA encoded STING modulators, virus-like particle (VLP) technologies, carrier-free nanocomplexes, and cell-based delivery approaches are also discussed for their potential to enable precise, tunable, and context-specific modulation of the cGAS-STING axis.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: T cell exhaustion (Tex) induced by chronic antigen exposure critically limits cancer immunotherapy. Mechanistic understanding remains incomplete, largely due to inefficient, costly in vivo models and a lack of effective interventions. Improved in vitro models are therefore urgently needed for mechanism discovery and drug screening. METHODS: An optimized in vitro T cell exhaustion model was established via chronic anti-CD3 antibody stimulation, achieving robust reproducibility, high cell yields ( approximately 10(8)), and suitability for high-throughput analyses. Exhaustion was validated functionally and by proteomic profiling across multiple timepoints. Rho family-interacting cell polarization regulator 2 (RIPOR2) was identified as a key regulator and functionally verified through siRNA knockdown assays. Molecular docking screened Ginsenoside F3 (GF3) targeting RIPOR2, and GF3 was tested both in vitro and in a mouse NSCLC model with anti-PD-1 therapy. RESULTS: Our model accurately recapitulated clinical exhaustion phenotypes, notably reproducing diminished cytotoxicity ( approximately 60% reduction compared to controls). Proteomics dynamically revealed significant protein alterations during exhaustion, including a  approximately 14-fold downregulation of RIPOR2 mRNA in exhausted T cells. RIPOR2 depletion further exacerbated exhaustion (e.g.,Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion reduced  approximately 30%, Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) increased  approximately 20%). GF3 robustly bound RIPOR2, significantly reversed exhaustion phenotypes (reducing PD-1(+)TIM-3(+)(Hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2) cells by  approximately 40%), and restored cytokine production. In vivo, GF3 enhanced CD8(+)T cell infiltration, synergized with anti-PD-1 therapy, and significantly reduced tumor burden ( approximately 40% decrease). CONCLUSION: RIPOR2 is identified as a critical immunometabolic regulator of T cell exhaustion. GF3-mediated RIPOR2 restoration effectively reverses exhaustion, presenting a novel immunotherapeutic strategy. Our optimized in vitro model provides an efficient platform for future mechanistic and pharmacological research."

Traditional Chinese medicine is a treasure trove of natural products (NPs) with anticancer effects. OBJECTIVES: We provide a comprehensive overview of NPs that can target high-fat diet-associated digestive cancers (HFDDC) and to investigate their mechanisms of action for drug discovery. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the EU Clinical Trials Register, using keywords including NPs, high-fat diet, digestive cancers, and specific NP names. RESULTS: NPs exert multi-targeting effects against HFDDC. This study systematically investigated their multi-targeting therapeutic mechanisms. Mechanistically, NPs (e.g., curcumin and berberine) can inhibit the transformation from inflammation to cancer by targeting STAT3 and WNT pathways. Several NPs (e.g., glycyrrhizic acid and mulberry leaf extract) activate SREBP and PKCalpha/Rac1 pathways regulating lipid metabolism to alleviate the accumulation of abnormal lipids in the cell, and reduce the growth of cancer cell. By modulating NRF2 and COX-2 pathways, rosmarinic acid and lycopene exert anti-oxidative stress. NPs such as salicylic acid and genkwanin consolidate the body's immune surveillance defense, and restore the human immunity and prevent the escape of cancer cells. Moreover, garo-oligosaccharides and prebiotics combat HFDDC through the restoration of the gut flora homeostasis. Existing clinical trials have shown that several NPs (e.g., berberine, curcumin, lycopene and fish oil) exert both anticancer and lipid-modulating effects. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate the great potential of NPs in preventing and treating HFDDC through multi-target mechanisms, laying the foundation for their clinical translation."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps are the gold standard for autologous breast reconstructions, but alternatives are needed when the abdomen is not optional. The superior gluteal artery perforator (SGAP) flap, using the gluteal region as donor site, is such an alternative. However, SGAP-flaps are not widely used for breast reconstructions due to technical and anatomical challenges, and potential donor site deformity. This study presents a slightly modified SGAP-flap harvesting technique for breast reconstructions aimed at optimizing outcomes and describes surgical and patient-reported outcomes. METHODS: An observational study (retrospective and cross-sectional) was conducted by including all women who underwent SGAP-flap breast reconstruction between May 2012 and March 2024 in a high-volume cancer center. Patient and surgical characteristics, (un)planned surgical revision rates, and patient-reported satisfaction were assessed using BREAST-Q (91% response rate). RESULTS: In total, 33 SGAP-flap breast reconstructions were performed in 26 patients. Mean ischemia time was 156 min. Four major complications (12%) requiring unplanned surgical intervention occurred, with no (partial) flap loss (i.e., 100% flap survival). Four flaps underwent planned secondary corrections (12%) of the donor site. Patient-reported donor site deformity and/or dissatisfaction was infrequent (n=2). Five patients underwent SGAP-flap on one side and DIEP-flap reconstruction contralaterally (15%), with similarly high patient-reported satisfaction and well-being scores for both sides. CONCLUSIONS: High patient-reported satisfaction, and low complication and donor site deformity rates were observed in patients undergoing autologous breast reconstruction using a slightly refined SGAP-flap technique. This technique may be considered as an acceptable alternative for DIEP-flap breast reconstructions."

    "abstract": "A new series of 2-(methylthio)-7H-[1,3,4]thiadiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidin-7-one derivatives was synthesized and evaluated for in vitro anticancer activity against six human cancer cell lines; laryngeal carcinoma (Hep2), human prostate cancer (PC3), cervical carcinoma (Hela), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG-2), human colon cancer (HCT-116), and mammary gland breast cancer (MCF-7). The most active compounds against the selected cancer cell lines, 3, 4, 6a and 6b were further screened for in vitro cytotoxicity against lung fibroblast (WI38) normal cells. The results revealed that they exhibited high SI values toward Hela and HepG-2 cancer cells. Analysis of cell cycle manifested that compound 3 induced cell cycle arrest in Hela and HepG-2 at G0-G1 phase causing cell death principally via apoptosis. Apoptosis induction by compound 3 was confirmed through elevated levels of caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in the screened cancer cells. Moreover, the same compounds were further evaluated for inhibitory activity against EGFR-TK(WT) and topoisomerase IIalpha. The obtained results revealed that compound 6a displayed strong inhibitory activity against EGFR-TK(WT) (IC(50) = 0.078 muM) that closely approximates the reference drug erlotinib and promising inhibitory activity against topoisomerase IIalpha (IC(50) = 12.6 muM) surpassing that of etoposide. Compound 6a dual inhibitory activity on the expression of EGFR-TK(WT) and topo IIalpha in HepG-2 cells was further evidenced through Western blot analysis. Furthermore, compound 3 demonstrated good inhibitory activity against EGFR-TK(WT) (IC(50) = 0.122 muM) compared to erlotinib and superior inhibitory activity against topoisomerase IIalpha (IC(50) = 16.8 muM) compared to etoposide. Additionally, compound 6a was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against EGFR(L858R) and EGFR(T790M) mutants, and it displayed promising activity against EGFR(T790M) and moderate activity against EGFR(L858R) (IC(50) = 0.088 and 0.189 muM, respectively) compared to erlotinib. Moreover, human epidermoid carcinoma (A431) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (H1975) cells were utilized to assess the in vitro cytotoxicity of compound 6a and it showed good activity over A431 and H1975 cells (IC(50) = 7.89 and 13.11 muM, respectively) compared to erlotinib. Molecular docking studies of 3 and 6a confirmed the high binding affinity of both compounds toward the active site of EGFR-TK(WT) and topoisomerase IIalpha. Finally, compound 6a was proved to adopt the exact fit into the active site of a double mutant EGFR(T790M/L858R). Molecular dynamics simulations of compound 6a were performed, and the results confirmed the stable binding interactions toward EGFR-TK(WT) and topoisomerase IIalpha active sites, supporting the consistency of the docking results."

    "abstract": "Triple negative breast cancer remains one of the most aggressive malignancies with limited targeted therapies and poor survival outcomes. Although DNA-intercalating agents, including natural products exhibit anti-cancer potential by disrupting various cellular processes that rely on DNA-protein interactions, their therapeutic application is limited by poor tumor selectivity and high cytotoxicity to normal cells. Here, through rational design, synthesis and optimization, we have developed a series of novel Quinoline-1(3H)-one derivatives aimed at enhancing selectivity towards TNBC. While several synthesized molecules demonstrated promising anticancer activity across multiple cancer cell lines, compound 4l emerged as the most potent and selective DNA-binding agent, exhibiting low IC(50) values in TNBC (IC(50) = 2.08 +/- 0.67 muM) with minimal cytotoxicity to WI-38 (CC(50) = >/=60 muM) a normal lung fibroblasts cell. Importantly, comparative analyses revealed substantially higher selectivity index of compound 4l than the clinical DNA-binding drug doxorubicin. Further in vitro, studies demonstrated that Compound 4l induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and robust, caspase-3 dependent apoptosis. This response was driven by marked intracellular and mitochondrial ROS generation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and non-intercalative electrostatic DNA binding. Collectively, these results highlight compound 4l as a promising, selective anticancer candidate with improved therapeutic potential for TNBC."

    "abstract": "CDK2 has a pivotal role in the cell cycle process, and regulates a broad range of important biological processes, and recent investigations have revealed that inhibiting CDK2 can reverse cancer resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors, indicating the therapeutic promise of CDK2 as an attractive therapeutic target in cancer treatment. Herein, we discovered a novel class of cycloalkyl-fused thiazole-substituted 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivatives as potent CDK2 inhibitors. Especially, compound 12c significantly inhibited CDK2 (IC(50) = 4.7 nM) which was 7-fold greater than positive control AZD5438, and exhibited remarkable antiproliferative efficacy toward HCT-116, A549, HeLa, and MCF-7 cells with the IC(50)s of 1.29-6.14 muM. Mechanism research revealed that 12c dose-dependently caused G(2)/M cell cycle arrest, and promoted apoptosis of HCT116. Overall, these findings present valuable leads and are of great importance to develop highly potent CDK2 inhibitors for cancer therapy."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with poor 5-year survival <15 %. We aimed to investigate the association between T and N stages of stage IV CRC and survival. METHODS: A retrospective population-based cohort analysis of patients who underwent surgery for stage IV colorectal adenocarcinomas from the SEER database (2010-2020) was conducted. T and N stages of the primary CRC were examined as independent predictors for cancer-specific survival (CSS) against other factors in a multivariable Cox regression analysis. the main outcome measure was 5-year CSS. Kaplan-Meier statistics were used to show differences in CSS among the groups. RESULTS: 73,427 patients (52.4 % male; mean age: 64.9 years) were included. 5-year CSS was 20.7 % (95 %CI:20.4-21 %). 5-year CSS rate significantly decreased with increased T stage (T1 and T2 = 33.3 %, T3 = 22.1 %, T4 = 17.4) and with nodal disease (N0 = 31.2 %, N1 = 23.6 %, N2 = 14.5 %). T4 tumors (HR:1.33, 95 %CI:1.05, 1.68; p = 0.017) and N1 and N2 disease (HR:1.27 and 1.59, respectively; p < 0.001) were independently associated with reduced CSS. Other independent predictors were increased age (HR:1.02; p < 0.001), male sex (HR:1.07; p = 0.005), Black race (HR:1.19; p < 0.001), signet-ring cell histology (HR:1.44; p < 0.001), poorly differentiated (HR:1.58; p < 0.001) and undifferentiated (HR:1.76; p < 0.001) carcinomas, perineural invasion (HR:1.23; p < 0.001), tumor deposits (HR:1.03; p < 0.001), elevated CEA levels (HR:1.96; p < 0.001), and multiple organ metastases (HR:1.82; p < 0.001). CSS improved with distant metastases resection (HR:0.86; p < 0.001) and systemic therapy (neoadjuvant: HR = 0.51, adjuvant: HR = 0.48, combined: HR = 0.40; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Advanced T and N stages of stage IV CRC were associated with worse CSS. Older, male, and Black patients with high-grade, mucinous, and signet-ring cell carcinomas, perineural invasion, tumor deposits, and elevated CEA levels had worse CSS. Systemic treatments conferred >50 % increase in CSS in stage IV disease."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Major pathological response (MPR) has emerged as a key surrogate endpoint for evaluating the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, its predictive value for long-term survival and its role in guiding individualized adjuvant therapy (AT) decisions require further validation in real-world populations. METHODS: This study is a multicenter retrospective cohort study, which included 373 NSCLC patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) or neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy (NICT) followed by radical surgery between January 2015 and December 2022. The primary endpoints were the cumulative incidence of death (CID) and the cumulative incidence of recurrence (CIR). Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: The overall MPR rate was 38.3 % (143/373). Multivariate analysis confirmed MPR as an independent protective predictor for both CID (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.41, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.23-0.72, P = 0.002) and CIR (HR = 0.32, 95 % CI: 0.2-0.61, P < 0.001). Patients with MPR showed significantly better 5-year CID (14.6 % vs. 44.7 %) and CIR (16.4 % vs. 54.7 %) (both P < 0.001). The core finding of this study is that the survival benefit of AT depends on the interaction between the neoadjuvant treatment modality and MPR status: In patients who did not achieve MPR after NCT, AT significantly reduced 5-year CID (44.7 % vs. 74.6 %, P = 0.008); however, in all patients after NICT, regardless of MPR status, AT did not show significant survival benefit. CONCLUSION: MPR is a robust predictor of long-term survival after neoadjuvant therapy for NSCLC. AT decisions should be based on a binary \"treatment modality-pathological response\" framework: non-MPR patients after NCT are clear candidates for intensive AT, whereas patients after NICT may not routinely require AT, regardless of MPR status."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Head and neck cancers (HNC) are common globally with high rates of locoregional recurrence. The detection and enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are emerging prognostic biomarkers in solid tumors. This study aimed to detect CTCs in HNC patients, particularly head and neck mucosal squamous cell carcinoma (HNmSCC), and evaluate its prognostic value for predicting relapse. METHOD: HNC patients undergoing surgical resection were prospectively recruited. Peripheral blood samples were collected preoperatively and postoperatively, then analysed for CTCs using the AccuCyte-CyteFinder platform. Prognostic performance was assessed using multivariate logistic regressions, ROC analysis and recurrence-free survival. RESULTS: Among 106 recruited patients, 79 had available preoperative blood samples and epithelial malignancies, with 57 (72 %) classified as HNmSCC. CTCs were detected in 81 % (46/57) of HNmSCC patients with a mean of 19 CTCs per 7.5 mL of blood (median = 9). Using a cutoff of >/=5 CTCs in a preoperative blood sample, CTC-high status was significantly associated with relapse (odds ratio = 9.52, p = 0.022) and a worse recurrence-free survival (p = 0.016). In multivariable analysis, CTC-high status remained independently significant after adjusting for other clinicopathologic parameters with consistent effect sizes across models (adjusted odds ratio = 8-10). Notably, both CTCs and margin involvement remained independently significant (margins: adjusted odds ratio = 6.17, p = 0.024) demonstrating complementary prognostic value. In exploratory postoperative follow-up samples (N = 36), CTC-high status was significantly associated with relapse (odds ratio = 26.71, p = 0.0009). CONCLUSION: CTCs detected using the AccuCyte-CyteFinder platform demonstrate independent prognostic value in HNmSCC patients, complementing conventional pathologic assessment, particularly margin involvement. This proof-of-concept study provides preliminary evidence that preoperative CTC enumeration could enhance risk stratification to identify patients at high risk of relapse, potentially enabling more personalised surveillance and treatments."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors subfamily B member 2 (LILRB2), a receptor with immunosuppressive properties belonging to the Leucocytes Ig-Like receptors (LILR) family, is extensively detected in various tumor tissues. Its major ligand, human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G), is pivotal in enabling tumor immune escape. This study sought to investigate the potential impact of LILRB2 gene polymorphisms (rs383369 G > A and rs7247538 C > T) on colorectal cancer (CRC) susceptibility and prognosis in the Tunisian population. METHODS: Genotyping of the LILRB2 gene polymorphisms rs7247538 C > T and rs383369 G > A was performed by PCR-RFLP. A total of 141 CRC patients and 150 healthy controls were included in this case-control study. RESULTS: The rs7247538 C allele and C/C genotype were found to be significantly more prevalent in healthy controls compared to CRC patients (p = 0.008 and p = 0.012, respectively). Furthermore, the C allele was more prevalent in the control subgroup above 50 years compared to CRC patients (p = 0.033). The rs383369 A/A genotype showed a significantly higher prevalence in controls than in CRC patients (p = 0.025). The rs383369 A/G genotype was significantly associated with a higher risk of CRC susceptibility in both the overall study population (p = 0.006) and in patients diagnosed after the age of 50 years (p = 0.014). The concomitant occurrence of both C and A alleles could provide a protective effect against CRC development (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The study indicates that LILRB2 SNPs are associated with susceptibility to CRC within the Tunisian population. These results underscore the relevance of LILRB2 SNPs as important biomarkers in CRC, potentially paving the way for the design of new personalized therapies guided by genetic profiles."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Targeted therapy is the first-line treatment for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors (VEGFRis) constituting the bulk of regimens used. Although the repertoire of VEGFRis for RCC now spans from sunitinib to cabozantinib, resistance to treatments has emerged as a common and prominent challenge. Thus, identifying novel therapeutic targets has become essential for enhancing the antitumor efficacy of current treatments and inhibiting RCC progression. METHOD: To investigate the potential mechanisms underlying VEGFRi resistance in RCC, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 library screen under sunitinib and cabozantinib treatment and identified UBL3 as a key driver of VEGFRi resistance in RCC cells. The critical role of UBL3 in promoting VEGFRi resistance was validated using CCK8 assays, flow cytometry, TUNEL assays, and bioinformatics analyses. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying UBL3, we utilized western blotting, RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation, small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) isolation, and Astral-DIA proteomics. The contribution of UBL3 to VEGFRi resistance was further confirmed through comprehensive in vitro and in vivo experiments. RESULTS: UBL3 was confirmed to suppress apoptosis and promote VEGFRi resistance through NOTCH signaling activation. Further investigations highlighted the importance of NOTCH signaling in VEGFRi resistance in RCC via the NOTCH-PTEN-AKT and NOTCH-FOS pathways and revealed the mechanisms by which UBL3 activated NOTCH signaling. On the one hand, UBL3 formed complex with NOTCH2 and ADAM17 simultaneously, accelerating ADAM17-mediated cleavage of NOTCH2. On the other hand, UBL3-modified NOTCH2 was sorted into sEVs, which were taken up by recipient cells, activating NOTCH signaling and thereby transmitting VEGFRi resistance. Finally, lipid nanoparticle-mediated delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 knockout system targeting UBL3 effectively restored the sensitivity of RCC tumors to VEGFRis. CONCLUSION: This study emphasized the importance of UBL3 in VEGFRi resistance in RCC and proposed that UBL3 activated NOTCH signaling through two distinct pathways, thereby suppressing cancer apoptosis and promoting resistance to VEGFRis. These findings provided a solid scientific foundation and paved the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for patients with advanced RCC."

We aimed to identify the risk of recurrence in NSCLC patients without lymph node metastasis. METHODS: Between 2009 and 2018, 187 patients underwent lung resection of one or more lobes and mediastinal lymph node dissection for p-Stage II-IIIA NSCLC. Among them, 112 were included after excluding those with a history of lung cancer, perioperative chemotherapy. Staging was based on 8th Edition of IASLC staging system. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify important prognostic factors for oncologic outcomes. RESULTS: Among the evaluated patients, 84 were male, and with a median age of 67 years. Seventy-one (51.4 %) patients were diagnosed with adenocarcinoma. The cancer stages were stage IIA in 34 patients, stage IIB in 57 patients, and stage IIIA in 21 patients. Multivariate analysis of disease-free survival revealed that vascular invasion (HR, 2.481; 95 %CI, 1.411-4.362, P < 0.01) and pathological T factor (HR, 1.819; 95 %CI, 1.226-2.699, P < 0.01) were the independent risk factors. Gray's test for equality of cumulative incidence functions revealed that the five-year cumulative incidence of recurrence was particularly high in patients with vascular invasion compared to that in patients without vascular invasion (21.5 % vs. 37.5 %, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Vascular invasion is a significant predictor of lung cancer recurrence in patients with p-Stage II-IIIA NSCLC without lymph node metastasis. The patients without vascular invasion in this cohort had a favorable prognosis, with a 5-year recurrence rate of 21.5 %."

PREDICT v2.2 is recommended in Dutch guidelines. Both v2.2 and the recently updated v3.1 have not been validated in the Dutch population. This study compares the predictive performance of PREDICT v3.1 and v2.2 for 10-year OS in Dutch breast cancer patients. METHODS: Women diagnosed between 2005 and 2013 with primary invasive breast cancer were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Ten-year OS predictions from v2.2 and v3.1 were compared with observed OS for the overall cohort and 36 subgroups defined by oestrogen receptor (ER) status, HER2-status, age, and tumour stage. Discrimination (ability to distinguish patients with different outcomes) and calibration (agreement between predicted and observed outcomes) of both models were assessed. RESULTS: Among 101,282 patients, both versions showed moderate discrimination (AUC v2.2 = 0.768; v3.1 = 0.775) and calibration (v2.2 intercept: 0.07; slope: 1.09; v3.1 intercept: 0.12, slope: 1.00). V3.1 slightly overestimated (1.9%), whereas v2.2 slightly underestimated (1.6%) 10-year OS. Across subgroups, v3.1 generally outperformed v2.2 except in patients aged >75 years, where v2.2 provided more accurate estimates. In ER-/HER- patients aged 50-75 years, v3.1 overestimated (1.5-2.8%) and v2.2 underestimated (2.8-5.3%) 10-year OS. CONCLUSION: Both PREDICT v2.2 and v3.1 accurately predict 10-year OS in Dutch breast cancer patients, with small differences between versions that vary by subgroup. No single model is optimal for all patients highlighting the need for subgroup-specific recalibration and careful interpretation when applying PREDICT."

While coal-derived polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were previously blamed, persistently rising lung cancer rates despite PAH reductions implicate other carcinogens. Here, we aim to investigate iron-rich minerals in Late Permian coal as potential overlooked drivers. Coal was sampled from Laibin, epicentre of Xuan Wei lung cancer epidemic. Mineral phases in low temperature ash (LTA) were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) along with selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Mineral morphology and elemental composition were examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and TEM equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). Lung tissues from 10 patients (5 female, 5 male) were examined for mineral deposition by SEM and TEM. We identified acicular iron-rich interstratified berthierine-chamosite minerals coating quartz/calcite in coal. Berthierine shares the serpentine group classification with chrysotile (i.e., white asbestos, a known human carcinogen). We observed abundant berthierine-chamosite needles in cancerous and para-cancerous lung tissues, with iron leaching from the berthierine-chamosite into acidic digestive vacuoles and accumulating in holo-ferritin and hemosiderin aggregates within autolysosomes. Given its much higher iron content than chrysotile, this needle-like berthierine-chamosite in Late Permian coal could be more bioactive and toxic, potentially driving the lung cancer epidemic in Xuan Wei, China. Our findings call for closer collaboration between mineralogists and health scientists for future research to gain deeper mechanistic insights and formulate intervention strategies."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Women of low socioeconomic status (SES) are at increased risk for being diagnosed with later stage breast cancer and experience poorer survival. However, younger women, especially women under 40, are underrepresented in breast cancer research given screening mammography is not recommended until age 40. How SES impacts stage at diagnosis and survival rates in women under 40 diagnosed with breast cancer has not been addressed. METHODS: Data was obtained from the national Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)*Stat Research Plus Census Tract Attributes Specialty Database, including 27 unique variables representing patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics. Proportional odds logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between SES and stage at diagnosis and Kaplan-Meier curves along with Cox-proportional hazards models were used to assess the relationship between SES and survival months. RESULTS: In both women of all ages and in women under 40, lower SES was significantly associated with later stage at breast cancer diagnosis (P < .001), poorer five-year (P < .001), and ten-year (P < .001) overall and breast-cancer specific survival rates in an incremental fashion. CONCLUSION: SES significantly impacts breast cancer stage at diagnosis and survival rates in a graded fashion, with lowering SES corresponding with later stage at breast cancer diagnosis and poorer five-year and ten-year survival rates across all age groups, including women under 40. Improving screening rates in low SES populations and initiating high risk screening strategies at an earlier age in women with low SES may help ameliorate these disparities."

Therefore, mining the molecular genes related to the progression of GC and predicting the progression of GC has important clinical significance. Therefore, this study investigated whether the P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2R) has a certain effect on GC. METHODS: The correlation data of P2Y2R and GC tissues from public databases was collected, and the relationship between P2Y2R and the survival and prognosis of GC patients was analyzed. Moreover, the expression of P2Y2R in GC cells AGS, MGC803, HGC27 and normal GES-1 was detected by Western-blotting. Cell scratch, Transwell invasion and YF phalloidin assays were used to investigate the effects of P2Y2R on migration and invasion of GC cells. RESULTS: P2Y2R was highly expressed in GC tissues and was negatively correlated with poor survival and prognosis of patients with GC. Activation of the P2Y2R by UTP promoted the migration and invasion of GC cells. However, the P2Y2R-specific antagonist AR-C118925XX inhibited the migration and invasion of GC cells. In addition, P2Y2R activation enhanced cytoskeletal stress changes in GC cells and promoted GC motility, while inhibition of its activity yielded the opposite effect. In addition, activation of P2Y2R increased the expression levels of p-PKC, p-Src, and p-ERK1/2, while AR-C118925XX treatment significantly decreased the expression levels of p-PKC, p-Src, and p-ERK1/2. CONCLUSION: High expression of P2Y2R is negatively correlated with survival and prognosis of GC patients. P2Y2R activation promotes GC progression may be related to PKC/Src and ERK signaling, indicating that P2Y2R may serve as a new molecular target for GC prevention and treatment."

    "abstract": "The universal posttranslational modification ubiquitination was originally discovered in the 1980s as a tag appended to cellular proteins to mark them for degradation by the 26S proteasomal complex. Subsequent discoveries have established ubiquitination as a process that directs spatial and temporal activities of proteins that are integral to all biochemical pathways in cells, in addition to its canonical role in facilitating life-death decisions of proteins. Protein ubiquitination is counterbalanced by  approximately 100 enzymes called deubiquitinases (DUBs) expressed in human cells. Although ubiquitination affects a plethora of cellular functions, the role of DUBs was initially linked to neuronal development, and later to cancer, where deregulation of protein degradation coincided with both increased expression of DUBs and worsening of disease pathology. As such, inhibition of DUBs has been regarded as a therapeutic approach for various cancers, and major investments of time and resources have been dedicated for developing DUB inhibitors for cancer therapy. The important roles of DUBs in the cardiovascular system have only recently been appreciated. DUBs play a protective anti-inflammatory role in the vascular smooth muscle, endothelium, as well as macrophages, and also serve to mitigate pathological remodeling of the myocardium in mice. Activation or positive allosteric modulation of DUBs could provide therapeutic benefit in the 2 major cardiovascular diseases, atherosclerosis and heart failure. In this review, we highlight the roles of select DUBs that have been characterized for their critical functions in the heart and vasculature. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Cardiovascular diseases represent a major global health burden and remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, accounting for approximately 18 million deaths annually worldwide. Among these, atherosclerosis and heart failure are 2 interrelated conditions with multifactorial, chronic, and complex etiologies, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutic strategies to reduce mortality and improve quality of life. Emerging evidence suggests that several deubiquitinases exert protective effects by attenuating atherosclerosis and cardiac dysfunction in murine models, highlighting the potential of deubiquitinase modulators to serve as novel therapeutic agents for cardiovascular diseases."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a systemic condition characterized by ligamentous ossification along the spine. While its prevalence has been well described in the general population, data on its occurrence in oncology patients remain limited. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and distribution of DISH and early-phase DISH in newly diagnosed cancer patients undergoing initial staging with Computed Tomography (CT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 1053 adult oncology patients who underwent thoraco-abdominopelvic CT for initial staging were evaluated. DISH and early-phase DISH were diagnosed using established radiologic criteria. Vertebral body densities were measured, and associated extraspinal enthesopathies and ligamentous ossifications were documented. RESULTS: DISH was present in 30.3 % of patients, including 13.8 % with established DISH and 16.5 % with early-phase DISH. Prevalence was higher in older patients and males (p < 0.01). Notably, renal (43.2 %), gastric (37.5 %), and colorectal (33.7 %) cancers demonstrated significantly higher DISH rates, whereas esophageal cancer showed a lower prevalence (13.4 %). DISH was associated with decreased vertebral bone density and frequent extraspinal enthesopathies. No significant correlations were found with BMI, diabetes, or hypertension. CONCLUSION: DISH is common among oncology patients and often coexists with extraspinal enthesopathies and reduced bone density. These findings suggest possible shared pathogenic mechanisms and underscore the importance of further studies exploring the relationship between DISH and malignancy."

This study introduces a novel approach by using polyhedral alkanes as linkers in PROTAC (Proteolysis Targeting Chimera) technology to address resistance mechanisms. Unlike conventional chain-like or planar linkers, five novel ALK-targeting PROTACs (BL-1-BL-5) featuring structurally unique polyhedral alkanes (cubane, homocubane, adamantane, D(3)-trihomocubane and norbornene) were designed and synthesized through innovative HAPOD trail and organic synthesis methodologies. Comprehensive in vitro evaluations revealed remarkable antiproliferative activity across all derivatives, with BL-5 (norbornene as linker) demonstrating exceptional potency (IC(5)(0) = 36.21 nM) against H3122 cells, surpassing both reference SIAIS164018 (BB-1, IC(5)(0) = 78.93 nM) and Brigatinib (IC(5)(0) = 44.83 nM). Western blot assay confirmed that BL-5 effectively degraded ALK at 100 nM concentration while effectively inhibiting ALK phosphorylation. Notably, BL-5 exhibited superior efficacy against Ba/F3 cells with the ALK G1202R resistance mutation (IC(50) = 118.86 nM) compared to BB-1 (IC(5)(0) = 126.41 nM). MD simulations provided critical insights, revealing that the BL-1, BL-4 and BL-5 significantly enhanced the ternary complex stability compared to traditional linkers. These findings establish the polyhedral alkanes as novel linkers in PROTAC design, with BL-5 emerging as a particularly promising candidate for targeting ALK."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has transformed the treatment paradigm for HER2-expressing breast cancer, including HER2-low disease. However, biomarkers associated with T-DXd activity remain poorly defined. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of clinical, genomic, and immune correlates of T-DXd outcomes to identify molecular determinants of therapeutic benefit and resistance. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 2 independent cohorts of patients with advanced breast cancer treated with T-DXd at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Yale Cancer Center between 2018 and 2024. We included patients with >/=2 tumor blocks with HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assessments prior to T-DXd. Clinical data on 524 patients were manually reviewed, and genomic profiling and immune microenvironment assessments were performed on a subset of patients. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models evaluated associations between molecular features and overall survival (OS) and time to next treatment (TTNT). RESULTS: Among 524 patients, HER2 IHC discordance between sequential tumor biopsies was observed in 20% of patients and was independently associated with significantly worse OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.67; P = .012) and TTNT (HR = 0.65; P = .002), resembling outcomes seen in HER2 0 tumors. Genomic analysis revealed that PTEN mutations correlated with inferior TTNT (HR = 2.2; q = 0.068), whereas ERBB2 amplifications predicted improved OS and TTNT. An inflamed tumor microenvironment determined by digital pathology was associated with significantly poorer TTNT outcomes (median TTNT = 5.5 months) compared with immune-desert phenotypes (median OS = 9.6 months, P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies HER2 IHC discordance and specific genomic and immune features as prognostic biomarkers of T-DXd efficacy. These findings warrant prospective validation and may inform biomarker-driven strategies to optimize T-DXd therapy in HER2-expressing malignancies."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the anti-tumor efficacy and underlying molecular mechanisms of prodigiosin (PG) in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). METHODS: The anti-cancer effects of PG were systematically evaluated in vitro using PTC cell lines and in vivo via xenograft mouse models. Cell viability and dose-response relationships were determined by CCK-8 assays. Anti-proliferative activity was assessed through colony formation and EdU incorporation assays. The impact on metastatic potential was examined by scratch wound healing and Matrigel-based transwell migration and invasion assays. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using flow cytometry. RESULTS: In vitro, PG at 500 nM inhibited the growth of BCPAP and TPC-1 cells by 93.5 % and 89.2 %, respectively, as determined by colony formation assays. Migration and invasion of BCPAP cells were reduced by 90.7 % and 93.4 %, measured via scratch wound healing and transwell assays. PG treatment modulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers both in vitro and in vivo, characterized by downregulating mesenchymal proteins and upregulating epithelial proteins, accompanied by changes in Wnt/beta-catenin pathway-related proteins, indicating suppression of EMT. Flow cytometry revealed that PG induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in both BCPAP and TPC-1 cells. Furthermore, PG upregulated the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), enhancing radioiodine uptake. Moreover, the treatment of PG significantly inhibited tumor growth without notable toxicity in vivo. CONCLUSION: PG exerts potent anti-tumor activity against PTC by simultaneously inhibiting proliferation, migration, and invasion, inducing cell cycle arrest, and enhancing radioiodine uptake, potentially through modulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Our findings position PG as a highly promising, potentially transformative therapeutic candidate for PTC, offering a strategic approach to overcome conventional therapy resistance and improve clinical outcomes."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: BRAF/MEK inhibitors are a cornerstone of the therapy of BRAF-mutant cancers. Despite frequent use, the incidence of cardiovascular side effects is still unclear. Data on cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD), particularly using contemporary biomarker-inclusive definitions, remain limited. OBJECTIVES: To assess the incidence and risk factors of CTRCD in patients receiving BRAF/MEK inhibitors, using the International Cardio-Oncology Society (ICOS) definitions, which include cardiac imaging and biomarker assessments. METHODS: A total of 75 patients treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors underwent prospective cardiotoxicity monitoring with two follow-up visits at 90 days (IQR 36-137 days) and 199 days (IQR 115-266 days). Standardized evaluations included echocardiography with global longitudinal strain (GLS), high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), and NT-proBNP measurements at baseline and follow-up visits. CTRCD was classified according to ICOS criteria. Baseline risk was stratified by European Society of Cardiology (ESC) risk categories. RESULTS: CTRCD occurred in 33 of 75 patients (44 %), with 17 % classified as mild, 23 % moderate, and 4 % severe. Baseline age, sex, BMI, and most cardiovascular risk factors were not significantly associated with CTRCD. Coronary artery disease was the only baseline variable associated with increased CTRCD (OR 11.0, p = 0.029; univariate analysis), whereas elevated hs-cTnT, NT-proBNP, or reduced LVEF at baseline were not predictive. Absolute CTRCD numbers were highest in the high ESC-defined cardiovascular risk category group, while incidence peaked in the low-risk group. Other cardiac complications occurred in 41 patients (55 %). CONCLUSIONS: CTRCD is frequent among patients treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors were not predictive, although coronary artery disease emerged as a strong risk marker. These findings highlight the need for dynamic surveillance strategies."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the role of Sialic acid-binding Immunoglobulin-Like Lectin-9 (SIGLEC9), a novel immune checkpoint, in Cervical Cancer (CC) and its interaction with immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. METHODS: SIGLEC9 expression in CC was analyzed using the TNM plot, TCGA, and Human Protein Atlas databases, alongside its correlation with tumor stage. The relationship between SIGLEC9 expression and immune cell infiltration was explored using TCGA and TISIDB databases. Single-cell analysis focused on SIGLEC9 in macrophages. Protein interactions were assessed through the String, IntAct, BioGRID, and Mentha databases. MUC1 expression was validated via GEO and GEPIA databases. Immunohistochemical staining, western blot, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry were used for verification. The prognostic significance of SIGLEC9 and SIGLEC9+ Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs) was evaluated. RESULTS: SIGLEC9 was found to be significantly upregulated in CC, with higher levels correlating with poor prognosis. It was expressed in macrophages and T-cells, and elevated SIGLEC9+ TAMs were linked to reduced overall survival. CONCLUSION: SIGLEC9 plays a crucial role in the progression and prognosis of cervical cancer through its interaction with TAMs and T-cells. These findings highlight SIGLEC9 as a potential target for new immunotherapies in CC."

    "abstract": "The regulation of mitochondrial membrane proteins is of crucial significance for breast cancer therapy. TOM70, which located in mitochondria outer membrane, could import MIC family molecules to preserve mitochondrial homeostasis. However, there are few agents targeting TOM70. Therein, the effects of curcumin and it's mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) on the TOM70 and mitochondrial function for breast cancer treatment were investigated. The 4 T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells were utilized as the breast cancer cells. The 4 T1 cell-bearing mice were constructed as the breast cancer animal model. The anti-cancer efficacy was validated using the CCK-8, Annexin-V/PI staining, colony formation. The associated molecules were detected by Western blots (WB), RT-qPCR, and Immunohistochemistry (IHC). The target was verified by molecular docking, CETSA, and DARTS. The mitochondrial proteins and DNA were extracted for the MIC60 and mtDNA damage detection. Curcumin treatment showed poor efficacy in the breast cancer model, as characterized by cell viability, apoptosis, proliferation of breast cancer cells, and the growth of tumor grafts in mice. However, curcumin-mediated PDT inhibited breast cancer in vitro and in vivo. Further exploration identified curcumin bond to TOM70, which is highly expressed in breast cancer, thereby activating it. But curcumin-induced PDT inactivated TOM70 through generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn interfered with the binding of MIC60 and its translocation into mitochondria. Curcumin-triggered PDT led to severe mitochondrial damage compared with the curcumin treatment, which could be blocked by the N-Acetylcysteine (NAC). Additional TOM70 rescue dampened curcumin PDT-mediated mitochondrial damage and anti-breast cancer efficacy. To summarize, the present research identifies curcumin-induced PDT inactivated TOM70, thereby attenuating MIC60 import, leading to mitochondrial damage against breast cancer. We propose a novel approach to tumor treatment through the regulation of mitochondrial membrane proteins using the phytomedicine-driven PDT."

    "abstract": "Once considered a non-essential amino acid, L-serine (L-Ser) is now recognized as conditionally essential in the brain, orchestrating a complex network of metabolic and signalling pathways. L-Ser provides carbon units to the one-carbon metabolism, supporting nucleotide synthesis and methylation reactions, and serves as a precursor for phosphatidylserine and sphingolipids. L-Ser plays crucial roles in glutathione and heme metabolism and interfaces with mitochondrial one-carbon pathways, thereby linking it to energy production, redox homeostasis, and epigenetic regulation. Its conversion into glycine and D-serine further supports neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive functions. Throughout the lifespan, L-Ser and its derivatives contribute to maintaining neuronal and glial homeostasis. However, fundamental questions remain regarding how L-Ser biosynthesis, transport, and compartmentalization are coordinated in the intact brain and how their dysregulation contributes to disease. Current knowledge largely derives from cancer biology or in vitro models, and translating these insights to the central nervous system poses major challenges. The lack of specific tools to monitor L-Ser flux in vivo, limited understanding of post-translational regulation of key enzymes and incomplete mapping of transport mechanisms across the blood-brain barrier still hampers deeper mechanistic and translational insight. This review compiles the most recent evidence, emphasizing the translational relevance of L-Ser-based interventions and underscoring the urgent need for systematic clinical trials to fully evaluate its therapeutic potential."

Effective intervention strategies, including prophylactic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for adolescents and primary HPV screening for adult women, are highly effective and cost-effective methods of prevention; however, delivering population-wide access to these prevention methods has been challenging, particularly in LMIC. The World Health Organization (WHO) has launched a global strategy for the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem through the scale-up of HPV vaccination, cervical screening and precancer and cancer treatment services. In this review article, we present the rationale, history and strategy behind the global cervical cancer elimination efforts, including the evidence underpinning the WHO's three pillars of cervical cancer control, and essential considerations for implementation, sustainable financing, and health systems implications. Many countries and regions are currently formulating frameworks to achieve cervical cancer elimination within their setting. Here, we consider implementation challenges for both LMIC, and high-income countries (HIC), calling upon the experiences of implementation guided by the WHO Western Pacific Region and Australian frameworks as exemplar settings."

    "abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were assessed in surface water and sediments of the Nilufer Stream, Bursa, Turkiye, to characterize their distribution, sources, water-sediment interactions, and associated ecological and human health risks. Samples collected from seven sites (S1-S7) revealed that the dissolved- and particulate-phase PAH concentrations in the waters ranged from 2.3 to 1118.5 mug/L and 0.3 to 422.0 mug/L, respectively, while sediments contained 32.2-836.6 ng/g dry weight. Upstream sites (S1-S2) exhibited minimal contamination, whereas downstream locations (S3-S7) reflected increasing PAH loads influenced by mixed urban, industrial, and agricultural pressures. Ring-distribution profiles showed LMW dominance in the dissolved phase and stronger MMW-HMW enrichment in particulate phase and sediments, while diagnostic ratios indicated predominantly pyrogenic inputs, particularly traffic emissions and biomass/coal combustion. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) further supported these findings, with PC1 capturing the majority of variance across dissolved- and particulate phases, and sediment as a unified pyrogenic factor, and PC2 distinguishing high-temperature industrial combustion from medium-temperature domestic heating, especially in downstream segments. Ecological risk indices (M-ERM-Q, M-PEL-Q, TEQCARC, MEQ) indicated low-to-moderate potential adverse effects, mainly in sediments. Water-sediment partitioning suggested that sediments act as long-term sinks modulated by organic carbon and hydrodynamics. Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR) values indicated negligible risk at S1-S2 but moderate cancer risk at S3-S7 for adults and children through ingestion and inhalation. Overall, the study provides a comprehensive spatial-temporal evaluation of PAH behavior in a mixed land-use watershed and integrates source-diagnostic and risk-based evidence to support targeted mitigation strategies in urban-industrial river systems."

    "abstract": "Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, is frequently overexpressed and amplified in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) as well as in several other malignancies, contributing to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. The present study employed a multi-step virtual screening approach to identify potential inhibitors of the Mcl-1 protein and subsequently validated their inhibitory activity through computational approaches. The 3-D structure of Mcl-1 protein was retrieved from the protein data bank and subjected to structure-based virtual screening. A series of drug-likeness and ADMET filters, including Lipinski filter, Swiss ADME, ADME-Tox, pKCSM and Protox-3 web, were applied to prioritize the compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile. Further evaluated by molecular docking, with particular emphasis on -CDOCKER interaction energy, identified tolbutamide (-101.09 kcal/mol), leucodelphinidin (-89.304 kcal/mol), and gossypetin -70.49 (kcal/mol) as, most promising candidates. To assess the conformational stability and dynamic behavior of the protein-ligand complexes, molecular dynamics simulation was performed for 100ns and extended to 500 ns for the best screened compound. Trajectory analysis was conducted using multiple descriptors, including root mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuation, the radius of gyration, solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), hydrogen bonds, and free energy landscape. In vitro toxicity studies using the MTT assay on the K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cell line demonstrated a significant reduction in cell viability, indicating potent antiproliferative activity. These computational studies highlight novel compounds as potent Mcl-1 inhibitors, suggesting their potential as promising therapeutic candidates for the treatment of CML. These findings lay the foundation for further optimization and preclinical evaluation of Mcl-1 targeted compounds in cancer therapy."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To classify digital mammograms based on radiological findings using morphology and texture descriptors with artificial neural networks (ANN) for breast cancer detection. APPROACH: The mammography dataset from High Specialty Regional Hospital of Oaxaca (HRAEO) (median patient age (mpa), 48 years [interquartile range (IQR), 41-54 years]) with radiological findings was retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent breast biopsy and were not previously treated. External testing was performed using mammograms from the National Cancer Institute (INCAN) (mpa: 47 years [IQR, 37-62 years]). The morphology was analyzed using a circularity descriptor (), and the texture was analyzed using the mean height/width ratio of the extrema descriptor (). These results were compared with cancer/benign histopathology, which was binarily classified using ANNs. The F1-score, Cohen's kappa (K), and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were employed as evaluation metrics, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for statistical analysis (h = 0, with p > 0.05, was considered as not statistically significant). MAIN RESULTS: 216 raw mammograms from HRAEO and 33 mammograms from INCAN (95+16 breast cancer and 121+17 benign findings) were included. The best internal testing results were obtained with a one-hidden-layer ANN with 100 neurons, achieving a F1-score of 0.95, K of 0.91, and an AUC of 0.953 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.917, 0.977) (h=0, p>0.99). However, the external testing results were significantly lower: 0.38 F1-score, 0.02 K, and 0.509 AUC (95% CI: 0.344, 0.664) (h=0, p=0.14) due to not exactly meeting the inclusion criteria and possible demographic and spectrum bias, or domain-adaptation issues. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed morphology () and texture () descriptors show promise for detecting breast cancer in raw mammograms, with radiological findings, in a local context. However, their poor external performance highlights the need for substantial further work before this approach can be deemed suitable for broader diagnostic applications."

Here, we investigated multiplexed histological images of paired pre- and on-treatment samples from nine patients with immunotherapy-refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with an oral HDAC inhibitor (vorinostat) combined with a PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab). Patient responses comprised of either stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD). An extensive multiplexed-image analysis pipeline involving both cell segmentation and quadrats, coupled with spatial statistics, machine learning, and deep learning was built to analyze the spatial and temporal features that predict disease progression and identify potential clinical biomarkers. Distinct spatial immune ecologies existed between SD and PD patients, and tumors from PD patients were already characterized by an immune-suppressive environment prior to treatment. Finally, the learned spatial ecologies predicted disease progression better than PD-L1 status alone, suggesting these ecologies could be used as potential companion biomarkers with PD-L1 in NSCLC. These findings will be investigated in a larger-cohort study generated from an ongoing clinical trial (NCT02638090) that includes a wider range of responses including complete and partial responders. Together, this study developed a computational infrastructure for analyzing multiplex imaging to predict immunotherapy response in NSCLC, which can potentially be generalized to any type of cancer."

Technology-based tools are emerging and show the potential to promote breast cancer screening (BCS), especially for underserved populations. METHODS: This review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines and the population, intervention, comparison, and outcome framework. We reviewed 24 peer-reviewed articles from databases including ProQuest Central, Scopus, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore published before February 21, 2025, which explore the efficacy of technology use in promotion of BCS. RESULTS: The included studies used diverse technologies, including videos, mobile health, websites, and sensor-based tools. The tools covered a variety of aspects for BCS promotion, including patient education, reminders, risk assessment, and competency building. Video-based interventions showed mixed results on BCS knowledge enhancement and screening rate promotion. Culturally tailored programs were effective in increasing screening rates among immigrant populations. Short messaging service reminders and web-based decision aids were associated with higher adherence and less decisional conflict. Challenges included technical barriers, limited digital access, and low engagement, which hinder the efficacy of the tools. CONCLUSION: Technology-based interventions are promising to improve BCS uptake, especially when tailored to cultural and linguistic needs. However, addressing barriers such as digital literacy and accessibility is critical for equitable implementation. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies and diverse populations to optimize these interventions and reduce disparities in screening adherence."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The use of immunotherapy for cancer treatment is becoming increasingly prevalent, resulting in a growing number of patients experiencing immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Given the frequency of immunotherapy-related thyroid dysfunction (irTD), there is a growing demand for endocrine consultations, which has led to scheduling delays. This quality improvement project aimed to decrease the time to consultation and normalization of thyroid function tests (TFTs) in patients with irTD. METHODS: Using the Plan-Do-Study-Act framework, a clinic dedicated to the evaluation and treatment of irTD was created. The immuno-oncology toxicity (IOTOX) clinic is staffed by advanced practice providers (APPs) using standardized algorithms and physician support. RESULTS: After implementation, a prospective analysis of 46 patients from the IOTOX clinic was compared with 67 historical control patients seen before implementation. The median consultation wait time improved from 21 to 9 days (P = .01), and the median time to follow-up decreased from 180 to 58 days (P < .001). Notably, the median time to thyroid-stimulating hormone normalization was reduced from 102 to 38 days (P < .001). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that an IOTOX clinic staffed by APPs using standardized algorithms with physician support effectively improved patient access to consultation and expedited the time to normalization of TFTs. This approach can serve as a framework for addressing other irAEs at our institution and has the potential to be implemented or adapted by other institutions to improve the care of patients with irAEs."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The OVHIPEC-1 trial demonstrated that adding hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) to interval cytoreductive surgery (CRS) for patients with stage III epithelial ovarian cancer results in a significant increase in recurrence-free survival and overall survival. To inform policymakers about the macroeconomic budget, we conducted a budget impact analysis. METHODS: The expenditure of the Dutch health care system between 2017 and 2025 associated with the introduction of HIPEC for patients with stage III ovarian cancer eligible for interval CRS (target population) was assessed during their entire treatment course (surgical and subsequent treatment). Cost estimates are based on national registry data, national benchmark costs for hospital-related activities, list prices for drugs, therapeutic guidelines, and expert opinion. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed to test robustness of the analysis. RESULTS: The Dutch target population is expected to increase from 200 patients in 2017 to 233 patients in 2025, with 80% receiving HIPEC in 2025. Between 2017 and 2025, the impact on the annual surgical budget is euro3.5 million, of which euro1.8 million is directly attributable to HIPEC and its associated costs. When considering the cost of all ovarian cancer-related treatments, an additional euro30,898 per HIPEC patient is spent in 2025, mainly driven by prolonged recurrence-free survival resulting in extended maintenance therapy and treatment for more platinum-sensitive recurrences. This leads to an annual total treatment budget impact of euro26 million in 8 years, with euro5.7 million directly associated with HIPEC use. CONCLUSION: Within the Dutch health care system, the surgical budget impact of HIPEC is acceptable and falls within the boundaries for reimbursement of the responsible decision-making bodies. The total budget impact is mostly affected by the high costs of systemic treatment after prolonged recurrence-free survival due to HIPEC."

While targeted therapy and immunotherapy have transformed first-line management, most patients without actionable genomic alterations (AGAs) will experience disease progression within the first year of their initial treatment. Here, we review pivotal trials, emerging strategies, challenges, and unmet needs for patients with advanced NSCLC without AGAs. Docetaxel with or without ramucirumab is the standard second-line therapy for patients who have progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Targeted therapy is only suitable for patients with specific AGAs. Understanding the hallmarks of cancer immune evasion is key to developing new strategies beyond chemoimmunotherapy. The combination of antiangiogenic agents with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has shown mixed results after progression on platinum and ICI. Bispecific antibodies, particularly ivonescimab, have shown encouraging early efficacy in this space. Artificial intelligence-driven pathomics and radiomics tools may help to refine treatment selection in the future. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy remains investigational. Patients with advanced NSCLC without AGAs who progressed after chemoimmunotherapy have limited treatment options. Novel therapies such as specific antibodies have shown promising results. Future progress will depend on the development of predictive biomarkers and understanding the mechanisms of resistance to ICIs to guide drug development."

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted among pediatric patients with brain tumor treated at CCHE between 2009 and 2020. Patients were categorized on the basis of demographics, tumor types, RT utilization status (prescribed, not prescribed, and did not complete), and geographic place of residence (urban v rural). RT utilization was stratified by tumor type and geographic region and compared using chi-square tests. RESULTS: Among 3,977 pediatric patients with brain tumor, 2,327 (58.5%) were prescribed RT. The highest RT utilization was observed among patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG; 98.2%) and germinoma (98.0%), while nonoptic low-grade glioma (LGG; 11.2%) and optic pathway glioma (OPG; 2.0%) had the lowest among patients prescribed RT, 2,264 (97.2%) completed treatment. The highest noncompletion was observed in patients with atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT; 6.7%) and nonoptic LGG (9.7%). Urban patients had a higher rate of RT completion (98.3%) compared with rural patients (95.9%; P < .001). CONCLUSION: RT utilization and completion varied significantly by tumor type, reflecting evidence-based treatment protocols and tumor-specific challenges. Geographic disparities in RT completion underscore systemic health care inequities in Egypt. These findings emphasize the need for targeted interventions, including decentralized radiotherapy delivery models and public health strategies, to improve access to and adherence to radiotherapy among underserved populations."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy characterized by poor prognosis. The ADRIATIC trial demonstrated significant survival benefits with durvalumab as maintenance therapy for limited-stage SCLC (LS-SCLC). However, the high cost of durvalumab necessitates an evaluation of its cost-effectiveness. METHODS: A partitioned survival model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of durvalumab consolidation therapy compared with the standard of care (SOC). The model comprised three mutually exclusive health states: progression-free survival (PFS), progression of disease (POD)/metastasis, and death. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000 in US dollars (USD)/QALY. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Analysis for POD was also stratified into intrathoracic, extrathoracic, and CNS. RESULTS: Durvalumab improved overall survival (OS) to 66.1 months and PFS to 40.2 months, compared with 57.8 and 31.8 months for SOC, respectively. The total cost of durvalumab was $163,722 USD versus $25,816 USD for placebo, resulting in an incremental cost of $137,905 USD. Durvalumab provided an incremental QALY gain of 0.36 years, yielding an ICER of $383,069 USD/QALY, exceeding WTP. On stratification, durvalumab in patients with extrathoracic progression nearly met WTP (ICER, $151,137 USD). CONCLUSION: Durvalumab remains cost-prohibitive for the overall cohort, exceeding acceptable thresholds despite favorable outcomes. Subgroup analysis, however, indicates that selective use in patients with extrathoracic progression may enhance cost-effectiveness. Overcoming economic barriers will be essential for the sustainable integration of immunotherapy into routine care."

Although long-term follow-up from previous phase III studies suggest that durable complete response (CR) may occur in a limited number of patients with first-line treatment, clinical characteristics of such cases remain poorly characterized. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients with mGC/GEJC who received systemic chemotherapy at our institute between April 2013 and March 2022. Patients were defined as having a potential cure if they demonstrated a clinical or pathologic CR, maintained progression-free survival for more than 3 years from the treatment initiation, and remained free from disease progression for at least 1 year after treatment discontinuation. Clinicopathologic features, treatment regimens, and biomarker profiles, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), mismatch repair (MMR), programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), and claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2), were analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients met the criteria for potential cure. The median age was 67 years and 72.5% of the patients were male and had single-organ metastasis. Among patients with assessable biomarker status, the proportions of positive cases were 23.5% for HER2 (n = 51), 23.3% for deficient MMR (dMMR; n = 43), 16.0% for CLDN18.2 (n = 25), and 30.0% for PD-L1 Combined Positive Score (CPS) >/=10 (n = 30). First-line therapy led to potential cure in 52.9% of patients. Ten patients were potentially cured with cytotoxic chemotherapy alone, while 23 and 26 patients received molecular targeted agents or immunotherapy, respectively. CONCLUSION: The introduction of molecular targeted agents and immunotherapy has expanded the chance of potential cure. The enrichment of dMMR, HER2-positive, and CPS-high tumors among potentially cured cases highlights the urgent need to develop effective therapies for those lacking actionable biomarkers."

The median age was 54 years in the intervention group and 53 years in the control group. The median follow-up was 15.1 months in the intervention group and 13.4 months in the control group. The 6-month and 12-month incidences of lymphedema in the intervention group were significantly lower than those in the control group (6-month: 0% vs. 10.78%, ARR (absolute risk reduction) 10.78%, P<0.001; OR (odds ratio) 0.143, 95% CI [0.065, 0.311]. 12-month: 2.38% vs. 16.18%, ARR 13.8%, P<0.001; OR 0.289, 95% CI [0.188, 0.446]). According to the results of the general linear model analysis, the mean DASH (disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand) scores in the intervention group were lower than those in the control group (F = 10.167, P = 0.002). The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that preserving axillary vein tributaries during ALND was a protective factor for postoperative upper limb edema, whereas stage III, extensive lymphadenectomy (level 2/3), radiotherapy and postoperative infection were risk factors. No serious complications or deaths related to the operation occurred. INTERPRETATION: ALND with axillary vein tributary preservation is beneficial for reducing the short-term incidence of postoperative upper limb edema and dysfunction, which is worth promoting in breast cancer patients who need ALND."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Image-guided thermal ablation (IGTA) has increasingly been used for stage IA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet long-term outcomes comparing IGTA with sublobar resection (SLR) without surgical contraindications remain unclear. Identifying patients who may benefit from ablation is also technically challenging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 2,145 patients treated with IGTA or SLR from 2012 to 2023 were analyzed. Propensity score matching was performed. Progression-free survival (PFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A deep learning model based on pre-treatment computed tomography images was developed to predict disease-free survival after IGTA and identify patients most appropriate for ablation. RESULTS: After matching, the median follow-up was 39.3 months for the SLR group and 46.7 months for the IGTA group. No significant differences were observed in PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-4.89; P = 0.120) or CSS (HR, 3.09; 95% CI, 0.87-11.04; P = 0.082). The area under the curve (AUC) of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model was 0.826 and 0.814 for the training and external validation cohorts, respectively. Higher ViT scores predicted worse survival (HR, 8.61; P < 0.001). The Multimodal XGBoost model further improved the performance. CONCLUSION: In this study, long-term outcomes after IGTA were not significantly different from those after SLR in patients with stage IA NSCLC. The ViT model accurately predicted outcomes after ablation. These results indicate that ablation may be a feasible alternative to conventional surgery in appropriately selected patients."

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer remains the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide. Early detection of cervical lesions in cytology images can prevent disease progression, but current deep learning methods for cell- or patch-level analysis in whole slide images (WSI) face significant challenges due to limited, noisy, or incomplete annotations. To address these limitations, weakly supervised learning methods, particularly multiple instance learning (MIL), have been explored. However, traditional MIL methods often suffer from label noise, leading to inaccurate feature extraction, which in turn restricts their robustness and generalization. In this paper, we propose Self-Correcting Instance Learning (SCIL), a novel two-stage instance-based MIL framework designed to enhance instance-level cervical lesion detection under bag-level supervision. SCIL incorporates a weakly supervised self-correction mechanism within a teacher-student architecture to mitigate the effects of noisy pseudo labels. This process involves a contrastive dynamic weighting strategy to adjust instance-level loss and enhance feature representation in stage one, followed by an uncertainty-based self-correction strategy in stage two to retain only high-confidence data with reassigned labels. Extensive evaluations of a slide cervical cytology image dataset demonstrate that SCIL significantly improves the detection of cervical lesions at both the patch and slide levels, highlighting its ability to overcome the limitations of imperfect data in cervical lesion detection."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The optimal reconstruction method following distal gastrectomy is crucial for improving postoperative outcomes and quality of life (QOL) in gastric cancer survivors. This study aims to compare three reconstruction methods-uncut Roux-en-Y (R-Y) with Billroth-II (B-II) and B-II Braun-in terms of bile reflux, other endoscopic findings, and QOL. METHODS: The study was a multi-center, open-label, phase 3 randomized controlled trial conducted across four hospitals. A total of 189 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the B-II, B-II Braun, or uncut R-Y groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. The primary endpoint was the incidence of bile reflux at 3 months postoperatively, evaluated via endoscopic examination. Secondary endpoints included additional endoscopic findings and QOL assessments using questionnaires survey. RESULTS: The operation time was significantly longer in the uncut R-Y group compared to the other groups. There were no significant differences in short-term outcomes among the three groups. The incidence of bile reflux at 3 months was significantly lower in the uncut R-Y group (6.8%) compared to the B-II (77.6%) and B-II Braun (63.6%) groups (p < 0.001). This superiority was sustained at 12 months (10.5% vs. 86.0% vs. 67.9%, respectively; p < 0.001). The uncut R-Y group also exhibited relatively lower rates of alkaline reflux gastritis and epigastric soreness. Dietary intake increased in all three groups from 3 to 12 months postoperatively, with no significant differences between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Uncut R-Y is superior to B-II and B-II Braun in reducing bile reflux and related symptoms after distal gastrectomy. These findings support the adoption of uncut R-Y as a preferred reconstruction method for long-term QOL improvement in gastric cancer patients.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical and oncologic outcomes of minimal access (endoscopic- or robotic-assisted) nipple-sparing mastectomy (MA-NSM) and conventional NSM (C-NSM). BACKGROUND: MA-NSM has been increasingly applied in the treatment of patients with breast cancer. However, high-quality long-term follow-up data remains lacking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database was conducted from single institute to compare the oncologic outcome of MA-NSM versus C-NSM. The clinical results and oncologic outcome (margin involvement rate, local recurrence and overall survival) were compared. To prevent bias, a cohort study approach was conducted with propensity score matching (PSM) method. RESULTS: During study, 1108 NSM procedures were performed. After inclusion and exclusion criteria, 905 NSM procedures were enrolled. These included 317 MA-NSM (245 endoscopic-assisted NSM and 72 robotic-assisted NSM), and 588 C-NSM cases. After PSM, there were 289 MA-NSM and 289 C-NSM cases compared. There were fewer major (Clavien-Dindo grade II and above) complications in MA-NSM compared with C-NSM (4.1% versus 10.7%, p = 0.03). The margin involvement rate of C-NSM was 3.5% versus 3.8% for MA-NSM (p>0.99). The follow-up duration of C-NSM patients was longer at 75.3 +/- 46 months compared to 66.1 +/- 39.1 months for MA-NSM patients. In Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis, there was no difference in recurrence-free survival (p = 0.17), however metastasis-free (p = 0.048), disease-free (p = 0.048) and overall survival curves (p = 0.025) showed marginally significant difference between C-NSM and MA-NSM after PSM. CONCLUSION: Our current study demonstrates that MA-NSM is oncologically safe, with comparable results in margin involvement, locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis and overall survival compared to C-NSM."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although cancer immunotherapy has significantly improved the clinical outcomes of tumors, the heterogeneity of individual responses remains a major challenge. The gut microbiota profoundly influences the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) through mechanisms such as metabolite secretion, immune cell regulation, and tumor microenvironment remodeling. The regulatory roles of specific microbiota features (such as Ruminococcus and Bifidobacterium) and metabolites (such as L-selenomethionine) have been confirmed. With the rapid development of research, the literature in this field has grown explosively, and traditional review methods are difficult to systematically analyze its knowledge structure, hotspots evolution, and interdisciplinary trends. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to map the knowledge landscape of gut microbiota in cancer immunotherapy using bibliometrics, to identify research trends, key contributors, and emerging hotspots. METHODS: Literature published from 1 January 2001, to 7 July 2025 was retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). After strict screening, 2,669 publications were included for bibliometric analysis using CiteSpace. Key analytical parameters were set as follows: time slicing =1 year, top N =50 per slice, pathfinder pruning. The analysis encompassed temporal publication trends, collaboration networks (countries/institutions/authors), keyword co-occurrence, clustering, and burst detection. RESULTS: The research showed a three-stage growth pattern of \"germination-development-explosion,\" peaking at 525 articles in 2024. China (988 articles) and the United States (762 articles) were the high-yield countries; England had the highest centrality (0.30) and was the global cooperation hub. The University of Texas System (149 articles), Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) (124 articles), and MD Anderson Cancer Center (123 articles) are high-yield institutions; the University of California System has the highest centrality (0.19). The top 3 authors in terms of publication volume were Zitvogel, Laurence (50 articles), Routy, Bertrand (47 articles), and Wargo, Jennifer A (39 articles). Authors with high centrality (0.03) include Kroemer, Guido; Trinchieri, Giorgio; Ascierto, Paolo Antonio; and Marincola, Francesco M. The most frequent keywords were gut microbiota (frequency = 690), immunotherapy (509), and colorectal cancer (358). Keywords with the highest centrality included immunotherapy (centrality = 0.30), t cells (0.22), and gut microbiota (0.20). The strongest emerging keywords were microsatellite instability (burst strength = 10.09), health (9.85), and diversity (9.65). Keyword cluster analysis (Modularity Q = 0.4276, Silhouette = 0.6724) revealed five major research directions: immune checkpoint inhibitor, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, efficacy, tumor microenvironment. CONCLUSION: This study systematically delineated a \"microbiota-immunity-tumor\" triangular knowledge framework that currently underpins the field, highlighting its maturation through bibliometric evidence. In the future, it is critical to integrate cross-scale mechanism exploration, standardized clinical translation pathways, and a global collaboration network to promote breakthroughs in personalized immunotherapy strategies, with direct relevance for clinical and perioperative care in oncology."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individualized postoperative management of colorectal ovarian metastases demands precision medicine tools, yet current approaches lack consideration of prognostic heterogeneity and targeted therapy benefit guidance and suffer from high costs and long turnaround times of genetic testing. METHODS: In this retrospective, prospective multicohort study, we developed and validated an interpretable transformer-based transfer learning model to predict patient prognosis, targeted therapy benefits and molecular mutations by integrating digital pathology with RNA data. The performance of the model was assessed with the AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV. RESULTS: The model accurately predicted peritoneal recurrence, with AUCs of 0.90, 0.74, and 0.83 across patient cohorts. It also achieved precise prognostic stratification for peritoneal recurrence-free survival in the training (HR = 107.22, 95% CI 24.18-475.52; p<0.001), external test (HR = 4.97, 95% CI 1.16-21.37; p = 0.03), and prospective test (HR = 10.53, 95% CI 2.02-54.94; p = 0.01) sets. The model revealed a significant association between prognostic stratification and tumor microenvironment heterogeneity (p < 0.05), thereby enhancing its biological interpretability. Further analysis revealed that only patients classified as high risk with BRAF/RAS mutations could benefit from the addition of targeted therapy to adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.18-0.79; p = 0.007). Moreover, the model predicted BRAF/RAS mutations with AUCs of 0.96/0.94 in the training set, maintaining cross-cohort generalizability with AUCs of 0.64-0.83. CONCLUSIONS: This pathobiology-based deep learning model can robustly detect prognosis and mutation and identify targeted therapy beneficiaries, serving as a potential precision tool in clinical decision-making for the management of colorectal ovarian metastases."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High tumor recurrence after surgery remains a significant challenge in managing prostate cancer (PCa). We aimed to develop and validate a 2.5D deep learning model based on a transformer architecture utilizing T2WI, ADC, DWI, and CE-T1WI images for the preoperative prediction of biochemical recurrence (BCR) in PCa, and to further investigate its capability for risk stratification. METHODS: A total of 923 PCa patients (10 153 images) who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) at five tertiary medical centers were retrospectively enrolled, with follow-up completed by September 2024. Among the five evaluated classifiers, ResNet18 was selected as the best-performing backbone for feature extraction. A Transformer-based deep learning (DL) model was developed using preoperative mpMRI data, and a deep learning fusion (DLF) model was constructed by integrating DL scores with weighted clinical variables, and its performance was compared with the traditional clinical risk score (CAPRA), a clinical model (Clinical), an ensemble learning model (Ensemble), and a multiple instance learning model (MIL). Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Model comparisons were conducted using the DeLong test, decision curve analysis (DCA) and calibration curves were used to assess the clinical utility and calibration of the models. Furthermore, Grad-CAM was used to visualize model attention and improve interpretability. RESULTS: The DLF model exhibited excellent performance in both the validation and test sets. It achieved an AUC of 0.938 (95% CI: 0.884-0.992) in the internal validation cohort and an AUC of 0.935 (95% CI: 0.900-0.969) in the external test cohort. The DLF model significantly outperformed all unimodal models (P < 0.05, DeLong test), improving AUC by 0.058-0.253 over the clinical model and 0.189-0.299 over CAPRA. Furthermore, the DLF model enabled effective risk stratification, with high-risk patients showing significantly poorer prognostic outcomes than low-risk patients (P < 0.05). It also demonstrated significant predictive power for recurrence events at multiple time points. Specifically, as measured by time-dependent AUC values, the model's predictive performance at 1, 2, and 3 years was 0.866 (95% CI: 0.810-0.921), 0.867 (95% CI: 0.816-0.918), and 0.879 (95% CI: 0.832-0.926), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The stacked DLF model demonstrated the capability to predict early postoperative recurrence in patients with PCa and effectively identify high-risk cases, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool for optimizing treatment strategies and postoperative surveillance."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with benign gallbladder diseases (BGBD) in China are characterized by prolonged illness duration, recurrent acute inflammation and poor medical compliance, all increase difficulty of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Complications including biliary injury, residual stones and intraoperative iatrogenic rupture (IIR) of the gallbladder wall (GBW) resulting in incidental gallbladder cancer (IGBC) exposure all warrant vigilance. This study aims to evaluate whether intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) could enhance safety of crucial steps of LC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients enrolled in this single-center randomized controlled trial were initially diagnosed with BGBD and randomly assigned to two groups at a 1:1 ratio, based on whether IOUS scanning was conducted during LC. The primary aim was to assess whether IOUS could: (1) Identify adherent gastrointestinal tracts within the surgical field; (2) diagnose cystic duct (CD) stones; and (3) guide the selection of appropriate dissection approaches of GBW to prevent IIR according to the modified Gallbladder Reporting and Data System (GB-RADS). RESULTS: A total of 152 patients were enrolled in this trial. IOUS helped in differentiating CD stones and adhered gastrointestinal tissues within the surgical area. IOUS effectively reduced IIR (3.95% vs. 17.11%, p = 0.017) because it clearly demonstrated morphology of GBW layers under different levels of inflammation. Additionally, among patients classified as GB-RADS 2B and 2C, the proportion of cases with atypical hyperplasia was notably higher than those with GB-RADS 2A and 1 (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: IOUS plays a pivotal role in enhancing the safety of critical steps during LC surgeries for selected complex cases. Integrating IOUS with GB-RADS is of great value in guiding the selection of safe GBW approaches and preventing IIR in cases with canceration risk."

    "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex ecosystem comprising tumor cells and their surrounding components, such as stromal cells, extracellular matrix, blood vessels, and signaling molecules. It functions as the \"soil\" that sustains tumor survival and progression, critically influencing tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. As a key component of the TME, the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) refers specifically to the interactive network between tumor cells and the immune system. This interplay dictates whether tumors are recognized and eliminated by immune surveillance or succeed in evading immune detection.The gastrointestinal microecology (GM) system encompasses the gut microbiota and their respective habitats. Gut microbiota influence tumor progression through immune regulation, metabolic modulation, and genotoxic effects, thereby shaping therapeutic responses. Meanwhile, tumor cells employ diverse metabolic pathways to meet heightened bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands and to mitigate oxidative stress-processes essential for their proliferation and survival. These metabolic adaptations significantly shape TME characteristics, including nutrient availability, hypoxia, and the induction of immunosuppression.This review summarizes the roles of the immune microenvironment, metabolic microenvironment, and gut microbiota in the initiation, progression, and treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). It further illustrates how these three components interact to collectively regulate PCa development and therapeutic outcomes. By integrating recent advances in these areas, we aim to provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of PCa pathogenesis and to inform comprehensive clinical strategies."

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with extensive peripancreatic vessel involvement is classified as locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). For this group of patients, the current standard of care does not include considering a potentially curative oncologic resection. However, recent advances in multiagent chemotherapy and surgical techniques are challenging this paradigm. Moreover, the current determination of anatomic resectability is vague and unreliable. Here we propose a definition of local resectability, based on pre- and intra-operative assessment. This anatomic definition of resectability assumes careful patient selection based on tumor biology and patient condition. The pre-operative evaluation of vascular anatomy and tumor involvement is conducted using 3D-rendering of pancreas-protocol computed tomography. Identifying a disease-free arterial or venous segment above and below the tumor involvement (\"suitable target\") is the single critical factor that determines anatomic resectability. Intraoperative isolation of these target vessels confirms the feasibility of vascular reconstruction before resection. This approach, which focuses on identifying target vessels rather than circumferential involvement, offers a more straightforward and clinically relevant method for assessing surgical eligibility in LAPC patients at centers of excellence. In summary, reconstructability-based on surgical expertise and guided by tumor biology-now defines the modern paradigm of resectability in LAPC."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance is implicated in breast carcinogenesis, but the comparative performance of different surrogate indices in associating with breast cancer risk among perimenopausal and postmenopausal women remains unclear. METHODS: We analyzed data from 7,713 peri-/postmenopausal women from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2020). Four insulin resistance indices, namely, the triglyceride-glucose index (TyG), triglyceride-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-C), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR), were assessed. Boruta algorithm-based feature selection preceded weighted multivariate logistic regression, estimating associations with prevalent self‑reported breast cancer. Restricted cubic spline method was used to test for nonlinearity. Mediation analysis explored mechanisms, whereas Cox regression was used to evaluate mortality. RESULTS: The TyG index was associated with higher odds of prevalent breast cancer, both as a continuous variable (OR = 1.52; 95% CI: 1.14-2.04; P = 0.005) and in its highest quartile (OR = 2.45; 95% CI: 1.18-5.07; P = 0.017, P for trend = 0.009),with a roughly linear pattern. HOMA-IR showed a weaker, nonlinear association concentrated only in the highest quartile (OR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.29-4.69; P = 0.007; P for trend = 0.013). TG/HDL-C and METS-IR were not consistently related. Uric acid to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (UHR, 33.84%) and the neutrophil-to-platelet ratio (NPR, 7.11%) partially mediated the effect of TyG (P < 0.05). Cox regression showed that the TyG index increased all-cause (HR = 1.67; 95% CI: 1.49-1.86; P < 0.001) and cancer mortality (HR = 1.57; 95% CI: 1.27-1.93; P < 0.001), but not among the subgroup of women with prevalent breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: In a nationally representative sample of peri-/postmenopausal women, TyG was associated with higher odds of prevalent breast cancer. Oxidative stress (UHR) and inflammation (NPR) may partially explain this relationship."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly aggressive solid tumor, with a 5-year survival rate of under 10% post-surgery. Surgical resection remains the only potentially curative treatment, but the outcome is heavily influenced by the tumor's biological heterogeneity. This results in considerable variations in patient prognosis. A particular challenge in PC is its diverse pathological subtypes, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma (PASC). While PDAC is the most common form, PASC is a rare but more aggressive variant with a worse prognosis. Despite similarities in treatment strategies, these subtypes exhibit distinct molecular profiles, and their response to therapy can vary significantly.This study aims to develop a machine learning-based prognostic tool that integrates multidimensional clinical data to overcome the limitations of single biomarkers, providing a more personalized and dynamic approach to monitoring postoperative survival outcomes. METHODS: In this study, two feature selection techniques (Boruta and LASSO) were used to identify key survival-related variables using clinical and laboratory data from postoperative pancreatic cancer patients. Nine commonly used machine learning models, including XGBoost, LightGBM, logistic regression, and random forest, were developed based on the most important 7 features and compared for predicting postoperative overall survival. We comprehensively evaluated the stability of the XGBoost sub-models, feature interpretability (via SHAP analysis), and generalizability across different pathologic subtypes. RESULTS: Among all models, XGBoost performed optimally on the validation set (AUROC = 0.796) and demonstrated consistent and stable performance in 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival prediction (AUROC = 0.593, 0.699, and 0.774) SHAP analysis showed that the variables of basophils, pathology type, DB, CA125, and HDL contributed the most to the prediction PDAC and PASC subtype analysis further confirmed the robustness and broad applicability of the model (AUC 0.730 and 0.822, respectively). The core features were related to clinical pathways, tumor microenvironment and patient system status, which enhanced the explanatory power and clinical translation potential of the model. CONCLUSION: The XGBoost-based machine learning model developed in this study integrates clinical, laboratory, and pathological data, providing superior predictive performance and good interpretability for assessing postoperative survival in pancreatic cancer. This model not only offers robust predictions for the general population but also effectively identifies risk variations across pathological subtypes. It holds substantial clinical value for postoperative risk stratification and decision-making in treatment planning."

    "abstract": "Tumor antigen vaccination represents an appealing approach for cancer but has failed to materialize as oncologic standard of care. To understand long-term vaccine efficacy, we conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with human epidermal growth receptor 2(+) (HER2(+)) breast cancer who received HER2-targeting vaccines and survived for >18 years. PBMC analysis revealed HER2-specific CD27(+) memory CD4 and CD8 T cells, suggesting that CD27 signaling supports long-term immune memory. In human CD27 transgenic mice, combining HER2 vaccination with anti-CD27 agonism enhanced HER2-specific responses, particularly long-lived CD4 memory T cells. Murine models demonstrated ~40% tumor regression with combined therapy compared with vaccine alone (~6%). Additional scRNA-seq analysis identified CD4 T cells with a distinct gene expression profile, and depletion/adoptive transfer studies validated that CD4 T cells were essential for this effect. These findings suggest that CD27 agonism enhances vaccine-induced antigen-specific CD4 T cell responses, enabling durable antitumor immunity not entirely dependent on CD8 T cells."

    "abstract": "Extracellular ATP (eATP), a well-recognized danger signal and immune activator, is implicated in the activation, differentiation, and function of T cells, directly or indirectly. Yet, how T cells release ATP themselves and its effects remain poorly investigated. Here, we found vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT), critical for vesicular ATP storage/release, is highly expressed in T(H)1 cells and selectively restricts their differentiation and effector functions. Mechanistically, VNUT facilitates lysosomal ATP import and its extracellular release upon T cell receptor engagement. This eATP then activates the purinergic receptor P2X7R and downstream SRC kinase, triggering a signaling cascade involving heightened Ca(2+) influx and hyperphosphorylation of JNK and FOXO3a, which ultimately impairs Eomes-directed IFN-gamma production in T(H)1 cells. Genetic/pharmacological of VNUT inhibition significantly potentiates T(H)1 effector functions against Listeria infection and transplanted tumors. These findings identify VNUT as a critical checkpoint in limiting T(H)1 immunity, coupling vesicular ATP transport to transcriptional control via the P2X7R-JNK-FOXO3a-Eomes axis, offering a target for treating infection and cancer."

    "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) acts as a primary physical barrier to cancer metastasis. While individual cancer cells can remodel ECM to create microchannel-like paths of least resistance, this cell-centric view overlooks the coordinated dynamics of multicellular communication. Here, we reveal that cancer cells collaboratively reprogram ECM to construct interconnected microchannel networks functioning as \"superhighways\" for barrier-free metastasis. Combining live-cell imaging, atomic force microscopy, and optical tweezers, we decode that the indispensable step in microchannel network construction is organized cross-convergence of adjacent channels. The convergence is precisely directed by mechanical bridges composed of aligned collagen bundles between adjacent channels, which transmit orientation cues to induce multicellular force coordination. Integrating single-cell sequencing and off-lattice agent-based model, we identify mechanically responsive leader cells enriched for integrin-RhoA/YAP signaling and matrix metalloproteinase 14, which sense bridge cues and initiate cross-convergence. Collectively, our findings unveil a self-organized metastatic network and its mechanobiological mechanisms, offering a previously unidentified framework and potential therapeutic insights for cancer metastasis."

    "abstract": "Developing computational methods for single-cell drug response prediction deepens our understanding of tumor heterogeneity and uncovers resistance mechanisms critical to improving cancer therapy. However, current approaches struggle to fully capture intratumoral heterogeneity, as bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) obscures heterogeneity across individual cells, while single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) remains constrained by limited throughput and high cost. Current approaches integrating bulk and scRNA-seq data frequently encounter batch effects, impairing robust knowledge transfer. Moreover, most existing methods overlook the role of intercellular interactions, treating cells as isolated entities. To overcome these limitations, we propose DAGFormer, a Graph-based Domain Adaptation framework that integrates bulk and scRNA-seq data for predicting single-cell drug responses. DAGFormer constructs cellular neighbor graphs using diverse topological strategies and employs Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) to bridge graph-level distribution gaps between bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data. A dual-domain decoder further disentangles shared and modality-specific representations, preserving both general and unique biological signals. Benchmarking DAGFormer on ten independent scRNA-seq datasets demonstrated its superior performance compared to existing methods, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in cancer drug response prediction."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as pembrolizumab, are integral to cancer therapy but can cause severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). These rare, life-threatening reactions typically occur early in treatment, with delayed onset being less commonly reported. CASE REPORT: We present a 67-year-old female with triple-negative breast cancer who developed a diffuse, painful rash five months after discontinuing pembrolizumab. Physical exam revealed  approximately 15% body surface area involvement without mucosal lesions. Biopsy confirmed SJS/TEN overlap. The patient had previously experienced pembrolizumab-induced Grade 2 pneumonitis. MANAGEMENT & OUTCOME: Initial treatment with high-dose corticosteroids yielded minimal improvement. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was added, resulting in clinical stabilization. The patient was discharged after 11 days with a steroid taper and showed gradual symptom improvement at one-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: This case highlights an exceptionally delayed onset of pembrolizumab-induced SJS/TEN overlap, extending known timelines for irAE manifestation. Prior pneumonitis may have predisposed the patient to subsequent cutaneous toxicity. Despite a SCORTEN score predicting high mortality, aggressive immunosuppressive therapy led to a favorable outcome. This underscores the importance of prolonged vigilance and multidisciplinary management in patients with prior irAEs."

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox regression, and statistical tests were applied to identify prognostic factors. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: During follow-up, 22.5% (20/89) of patients experienced recurrence, and 30.3% (27/89) underwent MT. The tongue was the most common site for OED (48.3%), recurrence (55%), and MT (44.4%). Males were more frequently affected than females (60.7% vs. 39.3%,), but females tended to remain cancer-free more often. Smoking and alcohol consumption did not significantly influence cancer development. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed 50% of MT cases occurred after about 108 months (mean: 114.8 months). The combined mean survival for recurrence and MT was 92.8 months. Cox regression identified WHO grading as the only statistically significant predictor of MT and recurrence/MT (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The WHO grading system plays a crucial role in predicting the likelihood of OED recurrence and malignant transformation. Lesion location showed only a non-significant trend, suggesting that its effect may be mediated by grade. These findings highlight the importance of using grading-based risk assessments and ensuring close follow-up care to better manage OED and improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Lung squamous-cell carcinoma (LUSC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) play a crucial role in the immune response and significantly influence the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, the prognostic and immunological implications of TLS-associated molecular subtypes in LUSC remain unclear. In this study, we applied 10 multi-omics integration strategies to perform a multi-omics analysis of the mRNA expression profiles, DNA methylation, and genomic mutation data of 39 TLSs-related genes, along with long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression profiles, to generate integrated consensus subtypes of LUSC. Four molecular subtypes were identified: cancer subtype 1 (CS1), CS2, CS3, and CS4. We observed a significant difference in overall survival between cancer subtype 1 (CS1) and CS3. Subsequently, we identified 33 prognosis-related genes based on differential expression between CS1 and CS3, which were further refined to 20 genes using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression algorithm, and constructed a prognostic signature termed the LUSC-Survival Prediction Index (LUSCSPI). The high-LUSCSPI group demonstrated a poor prognosis and was more likely to benefit from treatment with nine chemotherapeutic agents (shikonin, doxorubicin, CMK, S-Trityl-L-cysteine, paclitaxel, DMOG, gemcitabine, erlotinib, and crizotinib). In contrast, the low-LUSCSPI group exhibited a more favorable prognosis, with thapsigargin and cisplatin identified as promising treatment options. In conclusion, our results highlight the potential of LUSCSPI as an independent prognostic factor for LUSC. Further, the multi-omics consensus approach provides a robust foundation for prognostic stratification in LUSC patients, facilitating personalized treatment and disease management."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glioma is the most common malignant tumor of the central nervous system, and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) may play a crucial role in its progression. Our study aimed to predict the impact of HRD on glioma heterogeneity and patient prognosis from a multi-omics perspective. METHODS: We integrated HRD-related gene expression levels and survival information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases. Using a combination of machine learning algorithms, we identified the optimal algorithm and constructed the HRD Index model. After validating the model's accuracy, we assessed the expression heterogeneity of HRD-related genes in vitro using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Multiple omics analyses, including enrichment analysis, genomics, prediction of immune cell subtype infiltration, and drug sensitivity, were employed to demonstrate the heterogeneity and clinical predictive significance of the HRD Index in glioma. RESULTS: Through algorithm selection, the LASSO-RSF (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator - Random Survival Forest) algorithm identified 7 genes (POLR2F, FANCB, PTEN, PLK3, INO80D, PRMT6, and UNG) to construct the HRD Index. Model validation demonstrated excellent accuracy. qPCR results revealed differential expression of these HRD Index genes among different cell lines. Samples grouped by HRD Index showed potential differences in certain cytokine and receptor pathways, as well as varying gene mutation frequencies between groups. Drug sensitivity analysis indicated that the HRD Index could predict treatment efficacy for specific drugs. CONCLUSION: Our HRD Index model based on these seven genes significantly correlated with clinical prognosis in glioma patients and holds promise for guiding clinical management."

The objective of this study was to identify the leading predictors of opioid combination therapy with other therapies that may be inappropriate in older adults with cancer using interpretable machine learning approaches. A retrospective cohort design of older (> 66 years at diagnosis) cancer survivors (N = 2,682) diagnosed with primary and incident cancer in 2014. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry linked with Medicare claims database was used. Recursive feature elimination with random forest was used to extract the optimal number of features out of 119 for predictive modeling. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and global feature importance were used to identify the leading predictors and their associations with opioid combination therapy. Overall, 37.4% of older adults with cancer used opioid combination therapy. We included 34 features in the final predictive model.The predictive model had a good high area under the curve (AUC, 0. 758) and high recall (0.821) with the test dataset. We included 34 features in the final predictive model. Baseline opioids, NSAIDs, benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, chemotherapy, surgery, and female sex generally positively predicted opioid combination therapy. We observed relationships of zip code percentage residents and Native American residents living below poverty with opioid combination therapy. Patient-level baseline medication use, biological factors, cancer treatment, and zip code-level poverty were leading predictors of opioid combination therapy. Our study findings contribute to the knowledge for targeted interventions to reduce the risk of opioid combination therapy."

This study evaluated the antiproliferative and antimutagenic potential of ME, both isolated and in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin (OXL), using in vitro models. Cytotoxicity was assessed in the NCI-H460 non-small cell lung cancer cell line via the MTT assay, while the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-Cyt) assay was performed in CHO-K1 non-tumoral cells to investigate chromosomal instability and cytostasis. ME at concentrations of 5 and 10 microM significantly reduced the viability of NCI-H460 cells, demonstrating a cytotoxic effect. OXL alone also reduced cell viability; however, when combined with ME, this effect was attenuated, suggesting a protective or antagonistic interaction. In CHO-K1 cells, ME did not modulate cytostasis induced by OXL in any treatment protocol. Regarding genotoxicity, ME failed to reduce chromosomal damage markers (micronuclei, nucleoplasmic bridges, and nuclear buds) when administered before or simultaneously with OXL. Interestingly, post-treatment with ME significantly increased the frequency of micronuclei induced by OXL, indicating a potentiating effect. These findings suggest that although ME possesses antiproliferative activity against tumor cells, it may also interfere with the efficacy of OXL depending on the treatment schedule. The results contribute to understanding the dual role of phytochemicals in chemotherapy, emphasizing the importance of evaluating timing and interaction in combination therapies."

    "abstract": "Chromatin remodeling plays an integral part in endometrial homeostasis through its roles in the maintenance of cell identity, epithelial integrity, and prevention of endometrial disease. Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) is a chromatin remodeling protein and member of the NuRD complex, which predominantly represses transcription. CHD4 is mutated in endometrial carcinoma, with most mutations resulting in loss of function. CHD4 has been identified as a tumor suppressor and regulator of stemness in human endometrial carcinoma cell lines, but little is known about the tissue-specific roles of CHD4 in the endometrial epithelia in vivo. We generated a conditional Chd4 floxed allele and combined it with BAC-Sprr2f-Cre to drive CHD4 loss in the endometrial epithelium. Consistent with previous reports, BAC-Sprr2f-Cre shows variegated expression within the endometrial epithelium and lacks expression in the oviducts, ovaries, and kidneys. Loss of CHD4 was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, and the percentage of endometrial epithelial cells with and without CHD4 was quantified. Compared to the glandular epithelium, the extent of CHD4 loss was higher in the luminal epithelium and unaffected by age. Mice with conditional knockout of Chd4 had normal endometrial histology. A six-month breeding trial was performed to assess the functional effects of endometrial epithelial CHD4 loss on fertility and found no difference in litter size, average litter size per dam, or pup weight between genotypes. These findings demonstrate that Chd4 conditional knockout using BAC-Sprr2f-Cre is not sufficient to alter the structure and function of the endometrial epithelium or drive tumorigenesis. As CHD4 is frequently co-mutated with other cancer driver genes such as TP53, PIK3CA, and PTEN, future mouse modeling efforts emulating patient mutational profiles might provide insight into the role of CHD4 in endometrial carcinoma."

    "abstract": "Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) can activate the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 in the gut. However, its source and role in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that ssRNA within fecal extracellular vesicles (FEVs) derived from bacteria, particularly those susceptible to lysis by ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), can suppress CRC progression via Piezo1 activation. Gut-specific Piezo1-knockout mice developed more tumors following CRC induction. Similarly, Piezo1-deficient CRC cell lines exhibited increased proliferation with upregulated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Mechanistically, Piezo1 activation downregulated the transcription factor Zfp281, decreasing the expression of its target gene Lgr5 and dampening Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Notably, oral UDCA administration enhanced FEV rupture, increasing luminal \"naked\" ssRNA and mitigating high-fat diet-induced CRC in vivo. These findings identify the bacterial ssRNA-Piezo1 axis as a potential therapeutic target in CRC."

    "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy has transformed cancer treatment, yet only a minority of patients achieve durable benefit. Although early efforts to enhance immunotherapy focused on boosting immune effector function, reversing T cell exhaustion, or altering the tumor microenvironment, it is now clear that cancer cell-autonomous mechanisms play a major role in immune escape. Such programs, driven by the cancer cell genome, transcriptome, and epigenome, include desensitization to cytokine signaling, such as interferon (IFN)gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF); impaired antigen presentation; upregulation of suppressive ligands such as programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1); and epigenetic silencing of immunogenic pathways. The rise of high-throughput functional genomics, especially in vitro and in vivo CRISPR-based screening, has greatly expanded our ability to map these pathways and define how tumors evade CD8(+) T cell-mediated pressure. A deeper understanding of these cancer cell-autonomous immune-evasion mechanisms will be essential for developing new therapeutic strategies that broaden the impact of immunotherapy across diverse cancers."

METHODS: The systematic review was performed using PRISMA guidelines to evaluate techniques for soft triangle reconstruction and help guide surgeons for their best-fit reconstruction based on the size and composition of the defect they are faced with. A literature search was conducted to include the databases of MEDLINE via OVID, EMBASE, CINAHL, PubMed, and Cochrane central registry of trials. RESULTS: In the review, 13 studies were selected, encompassing 900 patients with differing defects ranging from 0.6 to 5.5 cm in size. Our study outlines complication rates experienced, revision rate, and surgeon vs patient outcome measures where they are reported. We have found that while composite grafts are effective for smaller defects, they experience a high number of complication rates, and therefore, for larger defects, we recommend using vascularized interpolated flaps with cartilage support grafts. CONCLUSION: This review underscores the importance of tailored approaches, anatomical understanding, and patient-centered decision-making. Future research should prioritize comparative studies and standardized evaluation metrics to enhance evidence-based guidelines."

This retrospective study included cases of early ESCC treated with endoscopic resection at this hospital from January 2015 to October 2024. Inclusion criteria were: (i) A case identified as a high-risk patient for ESCC due to the presence of multiple Lugol-voiding lesions . (ii) Screening endoscopy performed at intervals of 12 months or less. (iii) The depth of lesions detected under appropriate screening and treated with endoscopic resection was pT1a-MM or deeper. Five cases met the criteria, with a median age of 68 years (range: 48-81); all patients were male. The prior endoscopic examination before the detection was performed 6 months earlier in two cases and 12 months earlier in three cases. Among the cases, three lesions were located in the cervical esophagus (Ce), one in the middle thoracic esophagus (Mt), and one in the lower thoracic esophagus (Lt); the Mt and Lt lesions were on the anterior wall. The three Ce lesions measured 5-10 mm, while the Mt and Lt lesions measured 6 mm and 10 mm, respectively. Four lesions were diagnosed as pT1a-MM, and the Ce lesion as pT1b-SM2 with positive vascular invasion. The patient diagnosed with submucosa lesion received additional chemoradiotherapy. None of the patients have experienced cancer recurrence. This case series suggests that the Ce and the anterior wall of the Mt and Lt may be areas that require particular attention during routine ESCC surveillance. These findings may help improve quality of surveillance endoscopy for ESCC high-risk patients."

These processes are closely related to the maintenance of physiological homeostasis and the progression of various diseases. In recent years, with an in-depth understanding of membrane protein functions, developing membrane protein regulation strategies has emerged as a significant direction in both basic research and therapeutic applications. Precise modulation of membrane protein expression levels, conformational changes, and spatial distribution enables artificial regulation of cellular behavior, thereby opening promising avenues for treating diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and immune dysfunctions. This review comprehensively summarizes various physical technologies and biomolecule-driven approaches for membrane protein regulation, including applying light/temperature/magnetism/ultrasound-sensitive modules to achieve external physical control, as well as biomolecular tools, such as DNA, peptides, and proteins with specific receptor recognition properties that modulate membrane proteins via intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, the advantages and limitations of different membrane protein regulation techniques are discussed, aiming to provide new insights into cell function regulation and disease treatment."

However, reliable non-invasive assessment tool remains clinically lacking. To fill this unmet need, MR-DELTAnet, a longitudinal MRI-based Transformer framework that integrates Delta-Efficient Latent-Temporal Attention, is constructed to predict pathological complete response (pCR) to NCRT in locally advanced rectal cancer patients. In a multicenter retrospective cohort of 1,026 LARC patients between July 2012 and July 2023, MR-DELTAnet demonstrated robust discriminative performance across independent datasets, with the area under the curves (AUC) of 0.93 (95% CI 0.90-0.96), 0.88 (95% CI 0.82-0.94) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.79-1.00) and in training (n horizontal line633), internal validation (n horizontal line212) and external validation (n horizontal line181) sets, respectively. Risk-stratification by MR-DELTAnet prediction scores reveals significant survival differences: low-score patients exhibit prolonged disease-free and overall survival versus high-score patients (log-rank p<0.05). Applying the model to an independent single-cell RNA sequencing cohort (n horizontal line26) discloses biologically distinct immune microenvironments: high-score tumors are myeloid-rich and immunosuppressive, whereas low-score tumors harbor cytotoxic T-cell-dominant. Clinically, MR-DELTAnet provides an accurate, non-invasive tool for preoperative identification of pCR likelihood and biological phenotype, thereby potentially informing individualized treatment strategies for LARC management."

    "abstract": "Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), caused by biallelic mutations in the ATM gene, leads to multiple disease phenotypes, including cerebellar neurodegeneration, radiosensitivity, cancer predisposition, immunodeficiency, insulin resistance, and pulmonary inflammation. ATM plays a central role in regulating cellular responses to DNA breakage [M. B. Kastan, J. Bartek, Nature 432, 316-323 (2004)], but several cellular and physiologic abnormalities associated with ATM dysfunction suggest the possibility of noncanonical roles for ATM as well. Herein, we identified the HSP90 paralogue, GRP94, as an ATM interactor/substrate and found that ATM influences N-glycosylation of GRP94 and its subsequent activation/translocation to the plasma membrane, where it serves as a scaffold protein and stabilizer for several membrane proteins, including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as EGFR and IGF1-R. In selected cell types, ATM loss/inhibition resulted in increased cell surface expression of RTKs and overactivation of RTK pathways, alterations that were rescued by specific inhibition of cell surface GRP94. This ATM/GRP94 pathway also regulated the activation of microglial cells, manifest as increased cytokine production and phagocytosis activity associated with ATM loss/inhibition and reversal of that activation with GRP94 inhibition. These results identified GRP94 as an ATM interactor and apparent substrate and demonstrated specific critical regulatory roles for ATM outside of DNA damage signaling. These insights provide potential explanations for several of the phenotypes associated with ATM dysfunction and potential opportunities for novel approaches to blunt clinical symptoms in A-T, and also suggest that other neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders might benefit from selective inhibition of cell surface GRP94."

However, techniques capable of noninvasive, real-time tracking throughout the entire cell life cycle remain scarce. Here, we report a label-free dynamic monitoring method based on cell diffraction fingerprint imaging. This approach leverages a cell height characteristic spectrum derived from diffraction patterns to visualize and quantify the evolution of the cell viability. The method successfully resolved the four distinct stages of apoptosis and demonstrated that texture parameters derived from the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) effectively cluster cells according to their viability state. To validate its pharmacological applicability, we further employed the platform to assess the cytotoxicity of various drug combinations, including natural products (e.g., tea extracts) and conventional drugs. It successfully quantified their differential efficacy against cancer cells. This work presents a paradigm for continuous, noninvasive, single-cell-level viability monitoring, offering a robust analytical tool for mechanism-of-action studies, functional cellular assessment, and high-throughput drug screening. It also provides a theoretical and methodological foundation for advancing label-free optical imaging in cell pathology and biomedical engineering."

However, the proportion of patients who can benefit from it and its overall efficacy remain limited. Here the aim is to identify key dual-function targets that both inhibit proliferation and suppress immune evasion. Using whole genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based screening, the serine/threonine kinase T-lymphokine-activated killer cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) is identified as a key regulator of PD-L1 in gastric cancer upon IFN-gamma stimulation. Mechanical study is performed to explore the role of TOPK in promoting GC malignancy and immune evasion in vitro and vivo. Higher TOPK levels in tumor tissues are observed, correlated with clinical stages, efficacy and survival. Upon IFN-gamma stimulation, TOPK phosphorylates eIF4F complex component eIF4A1 to increase its unwinding activity of STAT1 mRNA, enhancing STAT1 translation efficiency. This process leads to adaptive overexpression of PD-L1 and IDO1, resulting in immunometabolic suppression through PD-L1-mediated inhibition, IDO1-induced tryptophan depletion and kynurenine production. TOPK inhibitors reshape tumor immunometabolic microenvironment to trigger anti-tumor immunity in GC. The IFN-gamma-TOPK-eIF4F-STAT1-PD-L1/IDO1 axis as a crucial regulator of the tumor immunometabolic microenvironment and provide novel insights into the combination of targeted therapy and immunotherapy for GC treatment."

This study investigates how polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-derived degradation products, ethylene glycol (EG) and terephthalic acid (TPA), influence colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis. Integrating network toxicology, machine learning (ML), and molecular docking, we identified 43 genes linking EG/TPA exposure to CRC pathogenesis. Functional enrichment analysis revealed their involvement in TNF/IL-17 signaling and glucocorticoid (GC)-mediated metabolic pathways, synergistically promoting chronic inflammation and immune suppression. Prognostic ML models prioritized SPP1, TJP1, and DDIT3 as hub genes significantly correlated with poor survival outcomes. Molecular docking confirmed EG's stable binding to these targets, suggesting mechanisms involving cytoskeletal remodeling, tight junction disruption, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Notably, GC pathway activation emerged as a critical driver of CRC progression, facilitating tumor immune evasion and therapy resistance. Our findings highlight the prognostic relevance of PET-derived MPs via GC signaling dysregulation, providing mechanistic insights into how environmental pollutants exacerbate cancer risks.

We used the proximity extension assay (PEA) to identify plasma biomarkers linked to early PD. METHODS: This study included 47 patients with unresectable HCC treated with Atezo/Bev, divided into derivation (n = 27) and validation (n = 20) cohorts. To identify plasma biomarkers for early PD, 92 cytokines were measured by PEA; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were then used to determine key protein cutoffs in derivation. Cutoff validity was confirmed in validation. RESULTS: PEA showed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2), and Tie-2 were elevated in early PD cases. ELISA confirmed significantly higher levels in early PD versus nonearly PD (VEGF-A: 78.3 pg/mL vs. 53.2 pg/mL and p = 0.002; ANGPT2: 18.4 ng/mL vs. 12.7 ng/mL and p = 0.007; and Tie-2: 24.5 ng/mL vs. 17.6 ng/mL and p = 0.009). After establishing cutoff values for each protein, multivariate logistic regression analysis incorporating clinical background identified VEGF-A as the sole independent predictor of early PD (cutoff: 73.9 pg/mL, OR: 40.00, and p = 0.006). The predictive value of VEGF-A for early PD was evaluated in the validation cohort. With a cutoff of 73.9 pg/mL, early PD occurred in 21.4% and 83.3% of the low (n = 14) and high VEGF-A groups (n = 6), respectively (p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma VEGF-A levels were identified as a significant biomarker for early PD in individuals with HCC receiving Atezo/Bev therapy."

However, efficacy remains variable. Our goal is to review the existing and emerging literature that provide mechanistic insights on how MMRd diversely impacts the current landscape of cancer therapeutics. AREAS COVERED: We summarize the biological impact of MMRd, highlight how variable etiologies and different MMRd cancer-types have significant diversity in genomic and immune profiles, how this drives primary and acquired ICI-resistance, and highlight the clinical trial landscape and preclinical efforts to harness these distinct mechanistic vulnerabilities into new therapeutic strategies. EXPERT OPINION: MMRd is currently recognized a tumor-agnostic biomarker for ICI treatment. However, differences in the MMRd etio-biology impact the immune microenvironment, contributing to significant response heterogeneity. Some patients show dramatic response to neoadjuvant ICI monotherapy and don't even need surgery, while most will need biologically rational combination approaches. Additionally, MMRd-driven genomic instability can make this a 'moving target,' mandating an ongoing effort to track and adapt to MMRd-driven cancer and microenvironment evolution. The next decade will focus on how best to effectively tailor immune-directed therapies for different MMRd cancers."

Current clinical management focuses primarily on symptom control, with few effective therapeutic agents. Understanding the factors influencing susceptibility to oral mucositis is essential for a comprehensive grasp of its pathophysiology. This study investigates sex as a biological variable in radiation-induced oral mucositis. Oral mucositis was induced via X-ray ionizing radiation using a fractionated dose of 8 Gy/d for 5 consecutive days, targeting only the head and neck area using male and female C57BL/6J mice aged 7 to 9 wk. Following sex-guided time points, we harvested tongues, stained with toluidine blue, and imaged to visualize mucosal damage. Histopathological analyses were performed using hematoxylin and eosin staining to assess mucositis severity and inflammatory infiltration. All irradiated groups showed a significant increase in mucositis severity versus controls, measured by the total number and area of ulcerative lesions as well as inflammatory cell infiltrate. Notably, there was a significant decrease in epithelial thickness in irradiated mice compared with nonirradiated controls, consistent with oral mucositis. Furthermore, female mice exhibited a greater area of ulcerative lesions and higher inflammatory cell infiltrate scores than males did. This study highlights the sexual dimorphism in the murine model of fractionated ionizing radiation-induced oral mucositis, demonstrating that female mice have an increased susceptibility to irradiation treatment."

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and peripheral T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires are emerging as promising biomarkers for predicting ICB response. Early characterization of ctDNA and TCR dynamics may enable timely treatment adjustments before clinical or radiological progression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The IO-KIN study (NCT04606940) is a single-center, prospective trial involving 15 patients with R/M HNSCC treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. Blood samples (n=104) were collected across seven timepoints from baseline to day 29. ctDNA was analyzed using a personalized assay (Signatera), and peripheral TCR repertoires were profiled using CapTCR-seq in eight patients. RESULTS: A decline in ctDNA after day 8 was associated with radiological response, longer progression-free survival, and a trend toward improved overall survival. TCR repertoires transiently diversified between days 8-22, with longer diversification windows in patients showing sustained ctDNA decline. Using the GLIPHII algorithm, an EBV-specific TCR signature was identified and persisted in patients with clinical benefit. Additional TCR signatures, potentially recognizing tumor-associated antigens, emerged as early as day 3 and were linked to positive outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous early monitoring of ctDNA and TCR dynamics reveals key determinants of ICB outcomes in R/M HNSCC. The transient nature of TCR diversification emphasizes the importance of precise sample timing to guide early therapeutic decisions and improve patient outcomes."

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this retrospective study, we analyzed 636 patients with KRAS G12V-mutated NSCLC diagnosed between 2018 and 2023. Clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics, including co-mutations, smoking history, PD-L1 expression, CD8+ T-cell infiltration, and treatment outcomes, were assessed. RESULTS: The majority of patients (94.2%) were current or former smokers, with a median tobacco exposure of 40 pack-years. Co-mutations were frequent, most commonly in TP53 (40.2%), STK11 (30.2%), and KEAP1 (29.3%). Heavy smokers exhibited significantly higher PD-L1 expression and more frequent TP53, KEAP1, and NTRK1-3mutations than light smokers. CD8+ T-cell infiltration showed a non-significant trend toward higher values in G12V compared to non-G12V KRAS subtypes. Among 151 patients with advanced disease, those treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) alone or in combination with chemotherapy had significantly higher response rates and improved real-world progression-free (rwPFS) and overall survival (rwOS) compared to chemotherapy alone. In patients with PD-L1 TPS >/=50%, ICB-based treatment achieved a median rwOS of 30 months. CONCLUSIONS: KRAS G12V-mutated NSCLC is characterized by a strong association with tobacco use, high co-mutation rates in clinically relevant genes, and a favorable response to PD-L1-based immunotherapy. The observed mutation landscape supports the potential for dual checkpoint blockade in a significant subset."

DESIGN: Data were collected from a retrospective cohort of women who initiated VHA care between 2001 and 2023 and participated for at least 6 months, completed MST screening, and did not have a previous diagnosis of cervical, uterine, or ovarian cancer. We compared women with and without a positive MST screen on demographics, health behaviors, and clinical characteristics. Unadjusted incidence rates of ovarian, uterine, and cervical cancers were calculated overall, and then by MST status. We used Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the associations of MST and gynecological cancer after adjusting for demographics, health behaviors, and clinical variables. PARTICIPANTS: The dataset included 775,464 women. MAIN MEASURES: A history of MST was the primary predictor of interest. Outcomes were first VHA electronic health record documentation of cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancer diagnoses. KEY RESULTS: Women were 40.9 +/- 15.2 years old, 51.4% were non-Hispanic White, and 31.4% had a positive MST screen. Unadjusted incidence rates for the total sample were 45.5, 36.7, and 26.5 per 100,000 person-years for cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancers, respectively. After adjustment, compared to women without documented MST, those with MST had a 25% greater risk of cervical cancer (95% CI 1.17-1.33), a 17% greater risk of uterine cancer (95% CI 1.09-1.27), and a 9% greater risk of ovarian cancer (CI 1.00-1.20). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, a history of MST was associated with an increased incidence of gynecologic cancers. These findings support the need for early screening and engagement in trauma-informed gynecologic care for women Veterans following discharge from the military, and potentially for other survivors of sexual violence."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: RAS mutations play a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of colorectal cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and pathological characteristics associated with RAS mutation status and to investigate its prognostic value in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. METHODS: This retrospective study included 446 adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer followed at Dokuz Eylul University Medical Oncology Department between 2010 and 2016, all of whom had available RAS mutation data and complete clinical records. RESULTS: RAS mutations were identified in 44.8% of patients, predominantly KRAS codon 12 mutations. Early-stage disease and absence of metastasis at diagnosis were more common in the RAS wild-type (WT) group (p < 0.001). Lung metastases occurred more frequently in RAS-mutant cases (p = 0.006). No significant difference in overall survival (OS) was observed between RAS-mutant and WT groups (53.6 vs. 52.5 months; p > 0.05). Anti-VEGF therapy conferred a modest OS benefit in RAS-mutant patients, whereas anti-EGFR therapy showed no effect. Among KRAS-mutant subtypes, codon 61 mutations were associated with the poorest OS. CONCLUSION: RAS mutation status may provide insight into metastatic patterns and disease stage in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. However, its impact on overall survival remains inconclusive. Further prospective studies are needed to clarify its prognostic value."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate global practice patterns, barriers, and physician perspectives on implementing ultra-hypofractionated radiation therapy (UHF-RT) in breast cancer treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 19-question online survey, distributed to radiation oncologists worldwide between February and August 2025, assessed UHF adoption, clinical use, barriers, training, and outlook. Chi-square tests compared adoption by institutional type, economic context, and physician experience (p < 0.05). RESULTS: 89 responses from 24 countries were analyzed. Moderate hypofractionation (MHF) predominated (70.8%), followed by UHF (20.2%). Overall, 80.9% had applied UHF, mainly for breast-only cases. Reported barriers included lack of clinical guidelines (49.2%), insufficient training (20.3%), equipment limitations (18.6%), and reimbursement issues (16.9%). No significant differences in adoption were found, though trends showed higher use in academic centers and high-income countries. CONCLUSIONS: UHF is increasingly adopted worldwide, yet MHF remains predominant. Standardizing education, infrastructure, and reimbursement policies could support wider global use."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tumor-infiltrating natural killer (NK) cells are pivotal in modulating tumor progression, either by promoting or inhibiting neoplastic development. Nevertheless, the implications of NK cells in breast carcinoma remain inadequately understood. This investigation aimed to delineate the impact of NK cells on both the prognosis and the immune infiltration landscape in breast cancer. METHODS: NK cell marker genes were identified using single-cell sequencing data from breast cancer available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A prognostic model was constructed based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and subsequently validated with the GEO dataset. Disparities in immune cell infiltration between low-risk and high-risk cohorts, as stratified by the prognostic model, were examined. Additionally, genes differentially expressed between these cohorts were subjected to enrichment analysis. RESULTS: A total of 29 NK cell marker genes were identified through single-cell sequencing, and a prognostic model was subsequently developed using machine learning techniques based on the TCGA data. This model demonstrated robust predictive performance when applied to both TCGA and GEO datasets. Notably, a significant difference in immune infiltration was observed between the low-risk and high-risk groups. The findings were further validated through enrichment analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we constructed a prognostic signature characterized by strong predictive performance, which has elucidated the critical role of NK cells in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Furthermore, this model offers a predictive index and identifies a novel therapeutic target for the advancement of immunotherapeutic strategies in the clinical management of breast cancer patients."

Specific communication challenges exist for culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) patients and healthcare professionals throughout cancer treatment. This literature review aimed to examine the cancer treatment experience of CALD patients. A systematic scoping review was conducted in January 2025 using the databases; OVID Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central. Search parameters included cancer, cultural diversity, language, and patient experience. Adhering to PRISMA guidelines and an established PICOS framework, 47 articles were selected for review. Exclusion criteria omitted duplicates, non-English language publications, articles published prior to 2010, and those unrelated to oncology and/or CALD communities. Three overarching themes were established from the literature; (1) education & empowerment, (2) quality care provision, and (3) system-level change. Communication barriers impacted the experience of cancer care and compromised treatment outcomes. Translated resources and staff cultural awareness training were observed to be beneficial for CALD patients. There is justified need to improve communication supports and resources for CALD patients and their clinicians. However, radiotherapy (RT) specific research is required to safely implement, contextualise and validate findings - informing bespoke communication improvement opportunities within RT practice."

    "abstract": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are central constituents of the tumor microenvironment (TME), recruited from circulating monocytes through chemotactic signals, and they execute complex, multifaceted functions throughout tumor progression. Functionally heterogeneous, TAMs are broadly classified into distinct subtypes that display a dynamic duality, capable of shifting between tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting states, though the pro-tumorigenic functions tend to dominate across multiple cancer types. The polarization of TAMs is modulated by diverse cytokines and signaling networks within the TME. Key pro-tumor mechanisms include activating proliferative signaling pathways, enhancing invasive and metastatic potential, establishing an immunosuppressive TME through immune cell interactions, and conferring therapy resistance. The spatial heterogeneity of TAMs further underscores the predictive relevance. Translational research increasingly focuses on TAM-targeting strategies such as inhibiting recruitment, depleting subsets, or reprogramming function. Emerging approaches, including nanomedicine-based targeting, macrophage-mediated therapies, and novel drug formulations, highlight the importance of combining conventional treatments with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Such combinations help overcome therapeutic resistance and improve clinical outcomes. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in TAM biology and plasticity, biomarkers from single-cell and spatial analyses for distinguishing TAM subsets, and their prognostic relevance in immunotherapy. It also discusses TAM-targeting strategies and their synergistic potential with existing therapies. Together, these insights lay the foundation for next-generation cancer treatments that precisely target TAMs to overcome therapy resistance and improve patient survival."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are endogenous non-coding RNAs implicated in the initiation and progression of cancer. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network exerts a crucial influence on tumor prognosis and therapy. This research aimed to identify novel circRNA-driven ceRNA networks and potential prognostic/therapeutic targets for gastric cancer (GC). METHODS: Gastric cancer-related circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA datasets were retrieved from the GEO database, accompanied by clinical and expression data from TCGA. Differential expression analysis, ceRNA network construction (Cytoscape_v3.8.0), KEGG/GO enrichment analysis, and survival analyses were conducted using R software. RESULTS: KEGG analysis of mRNAs within the ceRNA network indicated enrichment in the IL-17 signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, and other pathways associated with GC prognosis. Two key ceRNA axes associated with GC prognosis were identified: (1) hsa_circ_0055521/hsa-miR-204-5p/FAP and (2) (hsa_circ_0005051, hsa_circ_0007613, hsa_circ_0045602, hsa_circ_0034398, hsa_circ_0006089)/hsa-miR-32-3p/FNDC1. Survival analysis and immunohistochemical validation (HPA database) verified that FAP and FNDC1 are potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for GC. CONCLUSION: This study identifies three key pathways, two novel prognostic ceRNA networks, six prognosis-related circRNAs, and two target genes (FAP/FNDC1) for GC, offering new directions for GC therapy."

It is therefore being a microorganism of interest in preventing the onset and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed to evaluate both the protective effect on colorectal carcinogenesis after the oral administration of Enterococcus faecium 137v - EF137v in an experimental model for CRC chemically induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH), and its hepatoprotective activity. Female Wistar rats were treated with DMH and received a dose of E. faecium at a concentration of 1010 CFU / ml, varying the consumption period per group. Biochemical, histopathological, histochemical, immunohistochemical analyzes for VEGF-A, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, morphometry and apoptosis were determined. The studyshowed that, after the administering of EF137v, the intestinal mucosa was preserved and an attenuated rate of apoptosis. Low glycogen levels were observed in the positive control group (G2) that received only DMH when compared to the others groups. Our findings suggest that EF137v has a preventive effect on preneoplasic lesion, reducing and/or inhibiting inflammation, in addition to which aberrant crypts form, and this especially contributes to preventing liver inflammation in na animal model."

Biopsies can cause severe anxiety and pain. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of music and conversation on pain and anxiety in patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective trial at a Tertiary University Hospital in Turkiye. METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted. Ninety patients who had abnormal findings on DRE and/or a PSA value greater than 2.5 ng/ml and were scheduled to undergo TRUS-PBx were randomly assigned to one of three groups (n = 30) via the sealed envelope randomization method: control, music, and conversation groups. VAS pain, VAS anxiety, and STAI scores were recorded before and after the procedure. Statistical analysis was performed using One-Way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Pairwise comparison tests were conducted for the parameters that yielded significant differences among the control, conversation, and music groups. For all statistical analyses, a P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Conversation reduced pain and anxiety significantly (P < 0.001 and P = 0.01 respectively). Post-Bx VAS pain and STAI-State scores were lower in the conversation group. Pairwise comparisons revealed significant differences between the music and conversation groups (VAS pain, P < 0.001; STAI-State, P = 0.006). However, pain and STAI-State scores were similar in both the groups (VAS pain P = 0.645; STAI-State P = 0.597). CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that listening to music had no significant effect on pain and anxiety in patients undergoing TRUS-PBx. Conversely, the findings showed that engaging patients in conversation significantly reduced pain and anxiety during the procedure.

OBJECTIVES: To translate, cross-culturally adapt, and analyze the measurement properties of the Psychological Inflexibility in Pain Scale (PIPS) in Brazilian patients with chronic cancer pain. METHODS: Questionnaire translation, cross-cultural adaptation, and validation studies were conducted in two hospitals in northeastern Brazil. The measurement properties tested included structural validity, construct validity, reliability, and internal consistency. The following assessment instruments were used in addition to the PIPS: Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), Barthel Index, Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 122 patients, most of whom were women (65.6%) with a mean age of 49 years. Most patients had uterine cancer (23%) and leukemia (9.8%). We identified problems in the two-dimensional structure of the PIPS by presenting three inadequate fit indices. Adequate reliability was observed in both domains. Regarding the avoidance domain, there was a correlation with a magnitude > 0.30 with the depression domain of the HADS, and correlations with a magnitude < 0.30 with the anxiety domain of the HADS, the PCS domains, and the Barthel Index. The cognitive fusion domain did not correlate with any of these scales (P > 0.05). No ceiling or floor effects were observed. CONCLUSION: The Brazilian version of the PIPS is reliable; however, the instrument does not have a valid internal structure and the cognitive fusion domain is not a valid construct."

The aim of this study was to determine the human papillomavirus literacy levels of midwifery students. METHODS: This cross-sectional and descriptive study included midwifery students enrolled in a university in Turkiye during the 2024-2025 academic year. Out of 327 students enrolled in the midwifery program, 284 voluntarily participated in the study. Data were collected online using a Personal Information Form and the Human Papillomavirus Literacy Scale. A significance level of p<0.05 was used in the data analysis. Ethics committee and institutional approvals were obtained before the study. RESULTS: The mean age of the students was 21.08+/-2.46, and 27.8% of them were in the first year. A majority (82.7%) reported having information about human papillomavirus, primarily obtained from school (79.6%), social media/TV (48.6%), and health institutions (27.5%). Most students (97.5%) knew human papillomavirus is contagious, and 96.1% recommended human papillomavirus screening to others. The mean total Human Papillomavirus Literacy Scale score was 90.85+/-15.60, on a scale ranging from 24 to 120. The subdimension scores were as follows: 45.28+/-8.13 for knowledge, 21.75+/-4.56 for screening, and 23.81+/-4.04 for analysis. CONCLUSION: The study found that midwifery students have a high level of human papillomavirus literacy. The majority reported acquiring their knowledge through school and media, highlighting the positive impact of formal education and media on human papillomavirus awareness. The findings emphasize the importance of integrating human papillomavirus education into the curriculum. Additionally, community-based education programs can be effective in reaching broader populations, increasing awareness, and promoting preventive health behaviors."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The prognosis of metastatic breast cancer has improved with new targeted therapies like cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors. Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, such as direct renin inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are frequently used to manage hypertension and heart failure. However, recent research indicates that they may also provide potential benefits in cancer therapy. The combination of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors is an emerging area of interest in cancer research. Our hypotesis that, by inhibiting angiogenesis, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors may reduce tumor growth and improve the effectiveness of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors by cutting off the supply of nutrients and oxygen to the tumor. METHODS: Metastatic breast cancer patients treated with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors were enrolled and retrospectively divided according to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker use: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker (+) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker (-). Progression-free survival and overall survival were defined as primary and secondary endpoints. The effect of categorized data on progression-free survival and overall survival was determined by Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: Estimated median progression-free survival (HR 0.61, 95%CI 0.34-0.94; p = 0.041) and overall survival (HR 0.71, 95%CI 0.49-0.79; p: 0.01) were statistically significantly longer in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker (+) group than in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker (-) group. CONCLUSION: Concomitant use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors may have beneficial oncological effects in patients with breast cancer beyond their cardiovascular indications."

This meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) in lung cancer patients and to identify associated clinical predictors. METHODS: A systematic search of EBSCOhost, Embase, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science retrieved 2,823 records, of which 7 studies were eligible (PROSPERO: CRD42024551104). Meta-analyses of proportions and dichotomous and continuous variables were performed using R (meta package) via Jamovi and RevMan 5, with statistical significance set at p<0.05. RESULTS: Among 15,901 lung cancer patients, 177 had CPA and 135 had PJP. The pooled prevalence was 1% for CPA and 23% for PJP. CPA was significantly associated with male sex, smoking, COPD, interstitial lung disease, tuberculosis, and squamous cell carcinoma, and negatively associated with adenocarcinoma. CPA patients also had significantly lower BMI. Bilobectomy, radiotherapy, and concurrent chemoradiotherapy were additional risk factors for CPA. High-dose corticosteroid use (>/=20 mg/day) was significantly associated with PJP. CONCLUSION: CPA occurs in a clinically distinct subset of lung cancer patients with identifiable risk factors, while PJP appears to be strongly linked to immunosuppressive therapy. Improved screening strategies are warranted to mitigate the burden of these infections in vulnerable lung cancer populations."

This parameter is not included in gastric prognostic classifications or standardized pathological reports. AIMS: To evaluate TB in GA and its prognostic significance through survival analysis, in addition to investigating the association between TB and clinicopathological markers that are considered prognostic factors for this type of cancer. METHODS: This retrospective study covers a period of ten years, from January 2008 to December 2017. It included patients who underwent surgery for GA. TB evaluation followed the 2016 consensus guidelines for colorectal cancer, with three grades: Bd1 (0-4 buds), Bd2 (5-9 buds), and Bd3 (10 or more buds). Additionally, a two-grade classification system was employed, distinguishing between low-grade budding (fewer than 10 buds) and high-grade budding (10 or more buds). RESULTS: TB was classified as low-grade in 69% of the cases and high-grade in 31%. High-grade TB was significantly correlated with perineural invasion (HR [hazard ratio]: 2.98, 95%CI [95% confidence interval] 1.04-8.53, p=0.004), stages III and IV (HR 4.04, 95%CI 1.27-12.83, p=0.01), and mortality (HR 3.65, 95%CI 1.24-10.74, p=0.02). It was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival (RFS) (p=0.005, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that TB prognostic and predictive value in GA is significant, particularly regarding patient survival."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Drosophila melanogaster, a well-established model organism in biomedical research, has significantly advanced our understanding of genetic mechanisms underlying human diseases. Its genetic similarity to humans, with approximately 75% of human disease-related genes having orthologues in the fly genome, renders it a valuable tool for studying complex conditions like cancer. The organism's low cost, short life cycle, and manipulable genome make it ideal for high-throughput studies. MAIN TEXT: Recent advances have enabled the use of Drosophila as a model for different cancer types, including colorectal, thyroid, lung, and brain cancers. These models replicate key tumor characteristics such as cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Drosophila's utility in drug screening has been exemplified through heterochromatin-promoting assays and personalized medicine approaches using patient-specific gene expression data. Its role in testing therapeutic combinations, such as MEK inhibitors with statins for lung cancer, underscores its translational potential. Despite its utility, the model has notable limitations. Differences in tumor biology between flies and humans, especially regarding organ systems and immune responses, limit its applicability in certain cancer types and metastatic studies. Furthermore, environmental influences and the simplified genetic background of Drosophila may not accurately represent human cancer complexity. Ethical concerns and translational challenges also exist, warranting cautious interpretation of results. The recent advancements in CRISPR-based genome editing, particularly cytosine and adenine base editors, have improved gene-editing efficiency in Drosophila, supporting its ongoing use in precision oncology. Future directions point toward integrating Drosophila models with other in vivo and in silico systems to optimize personalized drug discovery and better emulate human tumor heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: While the use of Drosophila melanogaster has intrinsic limitations, its genetic tractability and compatibility with cutting-edge genomic tools position it as a complementary model to mammalian systems. Continued innovations in genetic engineering and model integration will further strengthen its role in translational oncology and precision medicine. This review explores the applications of the model in human cancer research and highlights the major challenges with its use. This is crucial for the fight against cancer, as it helps inform researchers of the potential areas that require further research, especially with the rapid evolution of personalised medicine."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Early detection of precancerous lesions such as adenomas and polyps is vital for prevention, yet standard colonoscopy may miss up to 26% of adenomas. Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted colonoscopy has emerged as a promising tool to enhance lesion detection. This meta-analysis provides an updated synthesis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the diagnostic performance of AI-assisted versus standard colonoscopy. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search of PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus identified 38 RCTs including 29,745 participants. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses by geographical region and AI manufacturer were performed to explore heterogeneity. Certainty of evidence was rated using the GRADE approach, and publication bias was assessed through funnel plots and Egger's test. RESULTS: AI-assisted colonoscopy significantly improved adenoma detection rate (ADR: RR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.14-1.25) and polyp detection rate (PDR: RR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.13-1.25), while reducing adenoma miss rate (AMR: RR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.38-0.72) and polyp miss rate (PMR: RR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.33-0.88). The mean number of adenomas per colonoscopy increased (MD = 0.20, 95% CI 0.14-0.25). AI modestly prolonged withdrawal time (MD = 0.46 min, 95% CI 0.26-0.66). No significant difference was observed for carcinoma detection (RR = 1.12) or advanced adenoma miss rate (RR = 0.67). Sessile serrated lesion detection showed a nonsignificant trend toward improvement (RR = 1.13), becoming significant after outlier exclusion (RR = 1.23). Subgroup analyses revealed higher ADR improvement in East Asian studies and with specific AI systems (e.g., Wision AI). Egger's test suggested minor small-study effects for ADR and withdrawal time. CONCLUSIONS: AI-assisted colonoscopy substantially enhances adenoma and polyp detection while reducing miss rates. However, its benefit for carcinoma and sessile serrated lesion detection remains uncertain. Further standardized RCTs with long-term follow-up are warranted to confirm its role in colorectal cancer screening."

    "abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) significantly impairs a person's physical and psychological health despite active treatment efforts. Thus, it is important to investigate the pathogenesis of OSCC to discover new therapeutic targets for clinical treatments. ORAI3 is a store-operated calcium (Ca(2+)) channel that has been associated with several cancers, including breast, prostate, and pancreas. Although the ORAI3 channel is recognized for its oncogenic potential, its pathological functions in OSCC are not well understood, especially concerning its involvement in cancer progression. In this study, we found that ORAI3 was upregulated in OSCC clinical samples and cell lines. When the expression of ORAI3 was knocked down in vitro in OSCC cells, store-operated calcium entry-mediated Ca(2+) influx into the cells was reduced. Importantly, the proliferation, migration, and invasive capabilities of these OSCC cells were also markedly decreased. Application of calmodulin or calcineurin inhibitors (W-7 or CsA, respectively) further suppressed these cell functions. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that ORAI3 knockdown led to downregulation of ETV4, a member of the ETS transcription factor family that is involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis and has been shown to be upregulated in some types of cancer. Here, overexpression of ETV4 rescued the suppressive effects on the proliferation, migration, and invasive capabilities of OSCC cells caused by ORAI3 knockdown. In addition, treatment with the calcineurin inhibitor CsA markedly reduced ETV4 expression levels in OSCC cells. Taken together, these results indicated that ORAI3 drives cancer progression by activating the Ca(2+)/calmodulin/calcineurin/ETV4 signaling pathway. Overall, these findings suggest that ORAI3/ETV4 may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of OSCC."

By cyclizing the 8- and 9-positions of berberine, a novel derivative, 2,3-dimethyldioxy-9-methyl-11-methoxy-8,10-cycloberberine chloride (BN-7), was synthesized for the first time. Its anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities, as well as acute toxicity profile, were also evaluated. BN-7 demonstrated potent antiproliferative activity, effectively suppressing the growth of two non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines through paraptosis. It also significantly inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 and THP-1 cells. Furthermore, acute toxicity studies following intravenous administration revealed that the median lethal dose (LD(50)) of BN-7 was 7.42 mg/kg (95% CI: 6.09-9.15) in Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice; and 11.82 mg/kg (95% CI: 9.80-14.43) in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. No significant changes were found in mortality, behavior, body weight, organ coefficients, or pathological observation at the dose of 5.25 mg/kg. Therefore, our findings provide novel insights into BN-7, indicating its potential as an anticancer and anti-inflammatory agent."

    "abstract": "Cure rates for childhood malignancies using established therapy protocols have increased to an average of 80% but have reached a plateau. Moreover, survival rates are particularly low for some pediatric tumors-such as high-risk group 3 medulloblastomas, osteosarcomas, Ewing sarcomas, high-risk neuroblastomas, and high-grade gliomas-and dismal for patients with relapsed malignancies. A functional drug response profiling platform for pediatric solid and brain tumors has been established within the INFORM program to identify patient-specific vulnerabilities and biomarkers and to unravel molecular mechanisms associated with drug response profiles for clinical translation. In this study, we performed a multiomics analysis using drug sensitivity profiles, as well as genomic and transcriptomic data, of 81 pediatric solid tumor samples. The integrative analysis suggested two multiomics signatures associated with drug sensitivity. One signature distinguished neuroblastoma samples with sensitivity to navitoclax, a BCL2 family inhibitor. A second signature was specific to a subset of Wilms tumors harboring the SIX1 (Q177R) hotspot mutation that displayed high expression of MGAM, PTPN14, STAT4, and KDM2B and high sensitivity to MEK inhibitors. A patient-specific causal interaction network analysis suggested possible molecular interactions between MEK inhibitors and the SIX1 mutation in Wilms tumor samples. In conclusion, the integration of drug sensitivity profiling and multiomics data revealed potential biomarkers that may be associated with drug sensitivity in pediatric solid tumors. Patient-specific causal interaction network analysis further elucidated the interaction between inhibitors and signature biomarkers, providing insights that may inform clinical translation. SIGNIFICANCE: The combination of multiomics analysis and drug sensitivity profiling identified two signatures related to drug sensitivity in pediatric solid tumors, contributing to the advancement of functional precision medicine and personalized treatment strategies.

In this work, we demonstrated that exosomes derived from HCC827/GR cells (drug-resistant) enhanced the survivability of HCC827 cells (drug-sensitive) under treatment with gefitinib. A total of 157 shared upregulated proteins between exosomes and their parent cells were identified in the comparison of the gefitinib-resistant groups versus the gefitinib-sensitive groups. Notably, 69 of these shared proteins are enzymes, and many of them were enriched in pathways related to fatty acid metabolism. Among these enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism, ACC1 exhibited the highest fold change in upregulated expression in both drug-resistant groups (exosomes and cells). Moreover, the expression of ACC1 was upregulated in gefitinib-sensitive cells after uptake of exosomes from gefitinib-resistant cells. The role of ACC1 in enhancing the survival of HCC827/GR cells under gefitinib treatment was demonstrated using an inhibitor and siRNA-mediated knockdown. Specifically, the upregulated ACC1 stabilized fatty acid oxidation and reactive oxygen species levels in HCC827/GR cells, thereby maintaining cellular metabolic homeostasis. Collectively, this work reveals the transmission of drug resistance in NSCLC via exosomes that carry the ACC1 protein."

    "abstract": "Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature, is essential for tissue homeostasis, development, and repair. Dysregulation of this tightly regulated process contributes to a wide range of diseases, including cancer, ischemic disorders, and chronic inflammatory conditions. This review focuses on the secreted frizzled-related protein (SFRP) family, a group of pivotal yet underappreciated regulators of neovascularization. We discuss the tissue-specific expression patterns, regulatory mechanisms, and functional roles of SFRPs in both physiological and pathological vascular remodeling. Particular attention is given to their interactions with key signaling pathways, including Wnt, highlighting their context-dependent effects on angiogenesis. Drawing on extensive preclinical evidence, we position SFRPs as novel regulators of vascular remodeling and explore their potential as promising targets for therapeutic intervention. This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of further mechanistic and clinical studies to unlock the therapeutic potential of SFRPs in vascular pathologies."

    "abstract": "In preclinical models, optimum tumor control by radiation therapy incorporates CD8 T cell control of residual cancer cells. Tumor control by these CD8 T cells is negatively regulated by myeloid and T regulatory cell expansions in the tumor following radiation treatment. We demonstrate using ex vivo 3D tumor models and novel in vivo cell tracking models that radiation results in upregulation of the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 on tumor macrophages and on monocytes that enter the tumor following radiation. This regulation of CD80 is not dependent on adjuvant signaling via MyD88 or STING in the myeloid cells. While we would anticipate that CD80 and CD86 would have a positive impact on anti-tumor immunity, we demonstrate that blockade of CD80 and CD86 signaling limits CD4 infiltrates in tumors and prevents the Treg expansion caused by radiation treatment. Importantly, this treatment results in improved tumor control following radiation therapy. These data link the inflammatory activation of myeloid cells in irradiated tumors to the Treg expansion following radiation and ensuing suppression of anti-tumor immunity."

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of behavioural speech therapy based on the transtheoretical model on chronic cough and quality of life in lung cancer patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery. METHODS: In this prospective randomized controlled trial, patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either the BST intervention or standard care every 2 weeks for 3 months after surgery. The primary outcomes included the prevalence and severity of chronic cough; the secondary outcomes included cough-related quality of life, anxiety and depression. Data were collected at admission (T0), 1 month post-surgery (T1), and 3 months post-surgery (T2). A mixed-effects model was used to assess changes across time points and outcomes. The study was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registration (ChiCTR2400084313; May 14, 2024). RESULTS: Between July and September 2024, we enrolled 112 patients for baseline assessment (57 patients in the intervention group and 55 patients in the control group). The prevalence of chronic cough was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (21.1% vs. 43.6%, adjusted RR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.19-0.64; P < 0.05). The mean difference in cough score was 4.11 (95% CI: -5.33 to -2.89; P < 0.001) lower in the BST group than in the control group from baseline to T2. The cough-related health scores of the intervention group were better than those of the control group in all dimensions after 1 month and 3 months. The mean differences in anxiety and depression in the BST group were greater than those in the control group from baseline to T2. CONCLUSIONS: BST effectively decreases the prevalence of chronic cough, alleviates cough symptoms and improves quality of life."

ATR is a key mediator of the replication stress response and plays a vital role in maintaining genomic stability. This study investigates the immunomodulatory potential of the ATR inhibitor (ATRi) tuvusertib to improve the targeting of prostate cancer (PCa) by immunotherapy. Tuvusertib pretreatment sensitized human PCa cells (DU145 and 22Rv1) to PBMC-derived natural killer (NK)-mediated lysis. Flow cytometric analysis identified upregulation of death receptor tumor-necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2), NKG2D ligand ULBP-1, and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) as a potential immunomodulatory effect of tuvusertib. Enhanced avelumab-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and lysis by PD-L1 targeting high-affinity NK (PD-L1 t-haNK) cells were observed in tuvusertib-treated DU145. Tuvusertib sensitized cells to lysis by recombinant human TRAIL, and TRAIL signaling blockade reduced NK-mediated lysis of tuvusertib-exposed cells. RNA analysis revealed elevated p21 and reduced Bcl-xL transcript levels in tuvusertib-treated DU145, suggesting an accumulation of DNA damage and suppression of anti-apoptotic signaling, respectively. Pretreatment of NK cells with the interleukin-15 (IL-15) receptor superagonist N-803 (nogapendekin alfa inbakicept) further enhaced the lysis of tuvusertib-exposed cells. In vivo in the DU145 PCa xenograft model, tuvusertib and N-803 combination therapy demonstrated marked and significant antitumor efficacy relative to either monotherapy, eliciting superior tumor growth control and prolonging survival. Our findings support further investigation into the use of ATRi with immune checkpoint blockade and/or immune-stimulating agents in prostate cancer."

The pivotal factors determining the effectiveness of CAR-T cells in the clinic is the selection of a reliable target and a specific ectodomain of CAR molecule. EpCAM is widely expressed in epithelial tumors, including pancreatic cancer, and is used as a tumor target in clinical trials of CAR-T cell therapy for gastric and colorectal cancers. However, the feasibility of using EpCAM CAR-T cells in pancreatic cancer still needs to be verified. In this work, we reported novel EpCAM CAR-T cells with a fully human single-chain variable fragment and evaluated their cytotoxic effects in a panel of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines, three-dimensional tumor spheroid models and patient-derived organoids, and two xenograft mouse models. We demonstrated that EpCAM CAR-T cells exhibited potent and specific anti-tumor activity against EpCAM positive pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo, without adverse effects by systematic delivery in xenograft mouse models. Our preclinical results provided evidence of the efficacy and feasibility of EpCAM CAR-T cells for the immunotherapy of pancreatic cancer."

The safety and efficacy profiles of LG following NAC remain incompletely defined. This study aimed to compare short- and long-term outcomes between LG and open gastrectomy (OG) in NAC-treated LAGC patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed consecutive LAGC patients undergoing LG or OG following NAC at our institution (Jan 2010-Dec 2019). Data from the prospectively maintained gastric surgery database were evaluated for demographic characteristics, operative parameters, perioperative morbidity, and oncological outcomes. RESULTS: Among 85 patients (46 LG, 39 OG), LG showed reduced blood loss, shorter hospitalization, faster bowel recovery, and earlier oral intake versus OG. Operative time was similar (LG 224 +/- 64 min vs. OG 183 +/- 52 min, P = 0.212). Complication rates were 19.6% (LG) vs. 25.6% (OG) (P = 0.683). At median 52-month follow-up, recurrence rates were 32.6% vs. 41.0% (P = 0.309). Five-year overall survival (51.8% vs. 56.7%, P = 0.492) and disease-free survival (45.3% vs. 52.4%, P = 0.443) showed no significant differences. The analysis involving multiple variables validated that the type of surgical method was not a standalone prognostic indicator for overall survival (P = 0.116) or disease-free survival (P = 0.108). CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic gastrectomy provides non-inferior technical safety and oncologic outcomes compared to open gastrectomy for LAGC after NAC. Given its benefits of being minimally invasive, such as attenuated surgical trauma and faster postoperative recovery, LG should be considered a standard therapeutic option for appropriately selected patients."

However, the development of potent and selective KDM6B inhibitors remains a critical unmet need. Based on the hit compound (A01) discovered by enzyme-level screening, a series of derivatives with quinazoline scaffold were designed, synthesized and identified as KDM6B inhibitors. Among these, compound 13k exhibited optimal potency (IC(50) = 1.8 muM) with superior selectivity over other JMJD subfamily members. Furthermore, 13k upregulates histone methylation levels in THP-1 cells, highlighting its functional effect in a cellular context. This study provides a promising scaffold for developing selective KDM6B inhibitors, as well as delivers a tool compound for probing the biological functions of KDM6B.

METHODS: We performed a comprehensive analysis of publicly available datasets to examine the expression patterns of KHDRBS family members in PCa, including CRPC and neuroendocrine subtypes. In vitro experiments were conducted using AR-positive 22RV1 and AR-negative PC3 cell lines to assess the expression and regulatory interactions of KHDRBS2 and KHDRBS3. Functional assays evaluated their effects on cell proliferation and tumor growth in vivo. Additionally, KHDRBS2 protein levels were manipulated in 22RV1 cells to assess their impact on AR-V7 and full-length AR expression. RESULTS: Our dataset analysis revealed distinct expression patterns of KHDRBS2 and KHDRBS3, with higher alteration frequencies in CRPC and neuroendocrine PCa. In vitro, KHDRBS2 and KHDRBS3 exhibited mutually exclusive expression, with KHDRBS2 predominantly found in AR-positive 22RV1 cells and KHDRBS3 in AR-negative PC3 cells. Reciprocal regulation between the two proteins was observed in both cell lines. Functional studies showed that both KHDRBS2 and KHDRBS3 promoted cell proliferation and tumor growth. Notably, silencing KHDRBS2 in 22RV1 cells led to a selective reduction in AR-V7 expression, without affecting full-length AR levels. CONCLUSIONS: These findings uncover novel roles for KHDRBS2 and KHDRBS3 in PCa progression, with KHDRBS2 identified as a potential key regulator of AR-V7 expression. Our results provide new insights into AR splice variant regulation and highlight potential therapeutic targets for PCa treatment."

However, its impact on breast reconstruction remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of PMRT in breast reconstruction from the patient's perspective. METHODS: This multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted in 10 Japanese institutions. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were collected using a comprehensive questionnaire incorporating surgical complications and the Japanese version 2.0 of the BREAST-Q \"Adverse effect of radiation\" module from 830 patients with breast cancer who had undergone reconstruction (214 with PMRT, 616 without). Complication rates were compared between the PMRT and non-PMRT groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of complications. RESULTS: The PMRT group showed a significantly higher overall complication rate (76.2% vs. 45.3%, P < 0.001), including dermatitis (48.1% vs. 9.9%, P < 0.001), cutaneous necrosis (9.8% vs. 2.9%, P < 0.001), capsular contracture (16.4% vs. 4.9%, P = 0.020), breast asymmetry (24.3% vs. 17.0%, P = 0.020), and upper limb lymphedema (7.5% vs. 1.1%, P < 0.001) versus the non-PMRT group. In the multivariate analysis, PMRT was identified as an independent risk factor only for cutaneous necrosis (P < 0.001). Adverse effects of radiation were observed in the PMRT group, including dryness (52.3%), pigmentation (46.4%), irritation (39.8%), soreness (38.7%), telangiectasias (36.4%), and skin thickness changes (33.2%). CONCLUSION: This is the first large-scale investigation in Japan to evaluate PMRT-related complications in patients who underwent breast reconstruction using PROs. Although PMRT increases complication rates, its direct impact is limited. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating patient-centered data into shared decision-making regarding reconstruction strategies."

    "abstract": "While breast cancer treatment outcomes have improved significantly through multidisciplinary approaches including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, the incidence of non-neoplastic pulmonary complications has also increased. Accurate interpretation of chest imaging is essential for managing these adverse events. This review outlines the major radiological findings of pulmonary injury during breast cancer treatment, focusing on two primary categories: drug-associated interstitial lung disease (DILD) and radiotherapy-associated lung injury (RLI). Regarding DILD, its clinical features, risk factors, differential diagnosis, and diverse patterns on high-resolution CT (HRCT) are described. The lung injury characteristics associated with specific drugs used in breast cancer treatment are also examined, placing particular emphasis on clinically important agents like trastuzumab deruxtecan. Regarding RLI, the pathophysiology (including acute radiation pneumonitis and chronic radiation fibrosis), relevant risk factors, and typical CT findings localized to the radiation field are discussed. Atypical manifestations are also addressed, such as radiation-induced organizing pneumonia (OP) outside the radiation field and the unique phenomenon of radiation recall pneumonitis. These complications can present with symptoms and imaging findings that mimic one another as well as other conditions, such as infections and lymphangitic carcinomatosis. This review aims to facilitate the timely and accurate differential diagnosis of pulmonary complications in breast cancer patients, thereby guiding appropriate therapeutic strategies and enhancing patient safety."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally. One of the current systemic therapies against estrogen receptor-positive BC is hormonal therapy with tamoxifen (TAM), a selective estrogen receptor modulator. Recent studies showed that TAM resistance may occur often due to enhanced drug efflux mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and ultimately can affect treatment efficacy. Epibrassinolide (EBR) is an apoptotic agent by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR). Continuous activation of UPR was suggested as a strategy to combat drug resistance, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we showed the anti-cancer potential of EBR on TAM-resistant cells, as well as parental cells by MTT cell viability, clonogenic and hanging drop assays, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay, and fluorescence stainings using 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and 3,3'-Dihexyloxacarbocyanine Iodide (DiOC6) for DNA condensation and mitochondrial membrane potential loss, respectively. The apoptotic potential of combined treatment of EBR and TAM was evaluated by western blotting and flow cytometry. The contribution of EBR-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress to the attenuation of TAM resistance was substantiated by its reversal upon pharmacological inhibition with TUDCA (Tauroursodeoxycholic acid). CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings demonstrated that EBR exerts potent anti-cancer effects on both TAM-resistant and parental breast cancer cells. The combined administration of EBR and TAM enhanced apoptotic signaling. Our data also revealed that EBR-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress plays a critical role in sensitizing TAM-resistant cells, since pharmacological inhibition of ER stress with TUDCA markedly attenuated these effects. Taken together, these results highlight EBR as a promising adjuvant strategy to overcome TAM resistance by targeting ER stress-mediated apoptotic pathways."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective single-center study involved 38 female breast cancer patients with a mean age of 50 +/- 11 years, who received systemic anthracycline chemotherapy. CMR was performed in all patients before initiating therapy (at baseline (BL)) and after a 12-month follow-up (FU). FT was utilized to evaluate the RV global longitudinal (GLS), radial (GRS), and circumferential strain (GCS), as well as the biatrial reservoir, booster, and conduit strain. Paired t-tests were used to assess the differences in strain values from BL to FU. RESULTS: The mean RV GLS of all patients was significantly attenuated at FU compared to BL (-25.2 +/- 3.9% at BL vs -20.6 +/- 4.4% at FU, p < 0.001), whereas RV GRS and GCS showed no significant change. LA reservoir strain was significantly reduced at FU (24.1 +/- 3.2 at BL vs 22.7 +/- 3.3% at FU, p = 0.005), while LA booster and conduit strain showed non-significant change. Similarly, RA reservoir strain decreased significantly from BL to FU (24.9 +/- 3.3% at BL vs 23.2 +/- 2.9% at FU, p = 0.019), whereas RA booster and conduit strain did not significantly change from BL to FU. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) is not confined to the LV but affects the RV and the atria as well. Changes in RV GLS and LA/RA reservoir strain could serve as additional markers of subclinical cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients. KEY POINTS: Question The role of RV and biatrial strain in detecting CTRCD is unclear. Findings Biatrial reservoir strain and RV GLS were significantly attenuated after breast cancer therapy. Clinical relevance RV GLS and biatrial reservoir strain might serve as early markers of subclinical cardiotoxicity after breast cancer therapy and should thus be routinely determined in patients with suspected CTRCD."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, making accurate diagnostic imaging essential for evaluating focal breast complaints. Standard breast imaging includes mammography (MG), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), and targeted ultrasound (US). Little information is known about the added value of MG/DBT compared to targeted US alone in women with focal breast complaints. This review provides a systematic overview of the (relative) sensitivity of MG/DBT, next to the use of targeted US in women with focal breast complaints, while emphasizing the variations of the reported guidelines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive PubMed search was conducted to identify articles published between January 2002 and February 2024 that assessed the diagnostic performance of MG/DBT and targeted US in women presenting with focal breast complaints. RESULTS: Of the 985 identified studies, 10 met the inclusion criteria after full-text evaluation. Palpable lumps and focal pain are the more frequent symptoms. Most studies show a high sensitivity (range 84.6-100%, the largest study reported 98.3%) of targeted US alone in relatively young women (30-39 years). Mammograms show added value, particularly when it comes to determining the extent of breast cancer and when confirming a benign abnormality. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted US is a reliable initial imaging modality, particularly in younger women (</= 40). When the US suggests a benign finding in low/average-risk women, the added value of MG is minimal. Routine use should be weighed against the risk of overdiagnosis, unnecessary biopsies, and radiation exposure. KEY POINTS: Question The best imaging strategy for women aged 30-40 with focal breast complaints is uncertain, and whether US alone suffices remains unresolved. Findings Initial targeted US shows high accuracy in this diagnostic setting, with MG/DBT adding value mainly in determination of tumor extent and from a screening perspective. Clinical relevance Using US as the primary imaging for women < 40 with focal breast symptoms may reduce MG, radiation, and discomfort, while maintaining cancer detection; however, any discordance between clinical and imaging findings should always prompt further evaluation."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled PBTA patients who underwent pancreatectomy. Resection margin status was classified as R0 and R1/R2. Clinical and radiological features were analyzed, including tumor resectability status based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria, tumor size, tumor-vascular contact, rim enhancement, peripancreatic fat stranding, adjacent organ invasion, and the minimum distance between the tumor and the anterior (TAS) and posterior (TPS) surfaces of the pancreas. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of resection margin status, with model performance assessed using ROC curves and DeLong tests. RESULTS: A total of 318 PBTA patients were randomly assigned to a training cohort (n = 222) and a validation cohort (n = 96) in a 7:3 ratio. Among them, 115 (51.8%) and 46 (47.9%) patients underwent R1/R2 resection, respectively. Independent predictors of R1/R2 resection included tumor resectability status (odds ratio (OR), 2.79), tumor size (OR, 3.17), rim enhancement (OR, 3.28), peripancreatic fat stranding (OR, 2.38), and TAS (OR, 8.91) (all p < 0.05). Model B (including all five independent predictors) outperformed Model A (including four independent predictors without TAS) in predicting the resection margin status in both cohorts (training: AUC 0.840 vs 0.757, p = 0.001; validation: 0.810 vs 0.711, p = 0.029). CONCLUSION: In addition to tumor resectability status, tumor size, rim enhancement, and peripancreatic fat stranding, TAS emerges as a potential predictor of resection margin status in PBTA patients. KEY POINTS: Question Resection margin status is associated with overall survival in pancreatic body and tail adenocarcinoma (PBTA), and predicting resection margin status is vital for risk stratification. Findings Clinical and CT-based radiological features, particularly the minimum tumor-to-anterior-surface (TAS) distance, can assist in preoperatively predicting the resection margin status in PBTA patients. Clinical relevance The nomogram integrating clinical and radiological features provides a reliable tool for preoperative prediction of resection margin status, supporting individualized and optimized treatment planning for PBTA patients."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Breast cancer (BRCA) remains one of the most prevalent malignancies and a major threat to women's health worldwide. The biological role and mechanistic basis of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) RERE-AS1 in BRCA remain unclear. METHODS: Clinical and RNA sequencing data from BRCA patients were analyzed to determine RERE-AS1 expression levels. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to visualize its distribution in tumor tissues. Functional assays were conducted in MCF-7 and T47D cells to assess the effects of RERE-AS1 on cellular proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), Transwell assays, and flow cytometry. Cell cycle progression was also evaluated. A co-culture system of BRCA cells and immune cells was established to examine immune cell migration, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and immune cytotoxicity. Cytokine secretion was quantified via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore, a xenograft mouse model was utilized to confirm the impact of RERE-AS1 on tumor growth and its response to anti-PD-1 therapy. RESULTS: RERE-AS1 expression was markedly decreased in BRCA tissues and correlated with overall survival (OS), tumor stage, and immune infiltration levels. Functional experiments demonstrated that RERE-AS1 overexpression inhibited BRCA cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Additionally, RERE-AS1 strengthened the interaction between BRCA and immune cells, reduced immune escape, and enhanced tumor sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. CONCLUSION: RERE-AS1 acts as a promising prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in BRCA. Its expression is closely associated with disease progression and patient outcomes and plays a regulatory role in tumor cell behavior and immune microenvironment modulation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: This study identifies RERE-AS1 as a critical regulator of tumor-immune interactions, suggesting its potential for guiding precision immunotherapy and prognostic assessment in BRCA patients."

    "abstract": "Bladder cancer ranks among the most common malignancies of the urinary system. Despite continuous advances in treatment technologies, the risk of tumor progression and metastasis remains high due to its extreme heterogeneity, resulting in poor patient prognosis. Patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer face the greatest challenges. Immediate clinical treatment is radical cystectomy after the administration of neoadjuvant therapy. The effect of different conventional chemotherapeutic drugs is heavily impaired by tumor resistance. In turn, the research of effective therapeutic approaches to prevent resistance of malignant tumors has turned out to be the most important clinical concern in the management of bladder cancer. Ferroptosis is another type of programmed cell death that is morphologically and mechanistically different than apoptosis and necrosis. To maintain high rates of proliferation, bladder cancer cells are hypernormal to iron-dependent oxidative stress. So using the ferroptosis inducers to destabilize their vulnerable antioxidant defenses provides a very specific targeting approach to the weaknesses of this natural metabolic homeostasis. Inductors of ferroptosis (erastin, artemisinin, conjugated polymer nanoparticle, quinazoline-aromatic urea analogue derivatives, etc.) show great potential in improving the efficacy of traditional anticancer drugs used to fight against bladder cancer. Preclinical studies combining standard therapies with ferroptosis-related treatments have yielded promising results. However, clinical trials targeting ferroptosis in bladder cancer remain scarce, posing challenges for translating these findings into clinical practice. In this review, we aim to highlight the latest advances in ferroptosis induction as a therapeutic strategy for bladder cancer. It provides a reference for subsequent research and additional insights into the development and validation of corresponding drugs for bladder cancer treatment."

Previous studies have associated it with lifestyle factors, including diet, although findings on diet remain limited or inconsistent. In Morocco, research on the role of dietary factors in BC risk is particularly scarce. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the association between dietary patterns and BC risk among Moroccan women. METHODS: A total of 2.800 women from Morocco participated in this case control study. Data were collected using a validated FFQ adapted to the Moroccan context, and Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to identify dietary patterns. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to assess BC risk across quartiles of adherence to each identified dietary pattern. RESULTS: PCA revealed four distinct dietary patterns. After adjusting for potential confounders, the \"Sugary and Refined Carbohydrate Diet\" was positively associated with higher odds of BC (OR = 7.71; 95% CI (5.79-10.26); p < 0.001). In contrast, the \"Plant-Based and Mediterranean Diet\" was inversely associated with BC risk (OR = 0.26; 95% CI 0.20-0.34; p < 0.001). For the dairy-rich diet, higher adherence showed lower BC odds in mid-quartiles, but the highest quartile was associated with higher odds after adjustment (OR = 1.79; 95% CI 1.41-2.29; p < 0.001). No significant associations were found for the Animal protein rich diet in relation to BC risk. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential risk of diets high in refined carbohydrates and the protective benefits of plant-based and Mediterranean diets in preventing BC."

We investigated whether skeletal muscle index (SMI), visceral fat area (VFA), and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) measured on CT scans predict survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. METHODS: This retrospective pilot study analyzed 46 NSCLC patients who had CT scans within 60 days of initiating checkpoint inhibitor therapy (93.5% pembrolizumab, 6.5% nivolumab) at a single tertiary care center. Body composition metrics were measured at the L3 vertebral level using TeraRecon software by a trained reader. Sarcopenia was defined using validated cutoffs (males < 45.4 cm(2)/m(2), females < 34.4 cm(2)/m(2)). Cox proportional hazards models evaluated associations between body composition and survival, with analyses stratified by sex. RESULTS: The cohort included 25 males (54.3%) and 21 females (45.7%), with median time from CT scan to checkpoint inhibitor initiation of 14 days (IQR: -47 to 18). One-year survival was 72.0% for males and 59.3% for females; two-year survival was 33.7% and 27.3%, respectively. Those who met the clinical criteria for sarcopenia did not statistically differ in survival compared to those who did not meet the clinical cut off (HR 1.21 (95% CI 0.63, 2.43). This finding remained consistent when males and females were examined separately and when the model was adjusted for timing to checkpoint inhibitor. CONCLUSION: In this small pilot study, pre-treatment body composition metrics did not significantly predict survival in NSCLC patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors. However, the study was likely underpowered with wide confidence intervals, limiting definitive conclusions. These findings provide a methodological framework for larger multicenter studies to validate the prognostic utility of CT-derived body composition in this population."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is associated with high recurrence and poor prognosis. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) offers a locoregional treatment strategy. However, the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin administered via HIPEC compared to intravenous (IV) infusion remain insufficiently characterized. This study aimed to compare local abdominal tissue concentrations and systemic exposure of cisplatin following HIPEC and IV administration in a healthy porcine model using microdialysis. METHODS: Sixteen healthy Danish Landrace pigs were divided into HIPEC (n = 8) and IV (n = 8) groups. The HIPEC group underwent CRS followed by 90-minute cisplatin-based HIPEC. The IV group received an equivalent cisplatin dose intravenously (100 mg/m(2)). Microdialysis catheters were placed in the liver, rectum, stomach (superficial and profound layers) and peritoneum. Free cisplatin concentrations were quantified using UPLC-MS/MS. RESULTS: Within the HIPEC group, cisplatin C(max) and AUC(0 - last) were significantly higher in the peritoneum compared to other abdominal tissues and plasma. The peritoneal-to-plasma AUC(0 - last) ratio was 8.7 for HIPEC vs. 1.8 for IV infusion (ratio: 4.92, 95% CI: 3.12-7.78, p < 0.001). Compared to IV infusion, HIPEC achieved significantly higher peritoneal C(max), while peritoneal AUC(0 - last) was comparable. In contrast, IV infusion resulted in significantly higher plasma and non-peritoneal tissue exposure. Plasma AUC(0 - last) was 4.7-fold higher following IV administration compared to HIPEC (95%-CI: 3.0-7.3, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: HIPEC concentrates cisplatin within the peritoneum while minimizing systemic distribution, whereas IV administration leads to a broad systemic and less targeted exposure. These findings support the pharmacologic rationale for HIPEC in maximizing local cytotoxicity and minimizing systemic toxicity in EOC treatment."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: About 30-50% of lung cancer patients suffer from insomnia with limited prevention options. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate whether acupuncture for cancer-related symptoms such as pain could reduce the incidence of insomnia symptoms. METHODS: We included newly diagnosed lung cancer patients without prior insomnia symptoms from Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine (2012-2021) and followed up until January 31, 2022. Cases were propensity score-matched by sex, age, ECOG PS score, pathological diagnosis, therapy, and comorbidities. The main outcome was the incidence of insomnia symptoms, identified by psychiatric diagnosis or insomnia symptoms in medical records. RESULTS: Among 1295 lung cancer survivors, 918 patients were matched (459 per group). Over an average follow-up of 218.6 days, insomnia symptoms were observed in 20.9% of the acupuncture group and 42.2% of the non-acupuncture group. Acupuncture was linked to a lower incidence of insomnia symptoms (adjusted HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.23-0.39). Higher frequency and more numerous acupuncture sessions further reduced the risk of insomnia symptoms (adjusted HR 0.15 for frequency of 1 day/session, adjusted HR 0.15 for sessions > 16). The acupuncture group had a significantly lower cumulative incidence of insomnia (log-rank test, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that acupuncture may prevent the incidence of insomnia symptoms in patients with lung cancer. Daily sessions and a cumulative total of 16 or more treatments may enhance the benefit."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility and accuracy of using deep learning to generate simulated contrast-enhanced T1-weighted rectal MRI scans from pre-contrast MRI sequences in rectal cancer patients. METHODS: This study included 514 patients with pathologically confirmed rectal carcinoma who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI at three academic institutions. A two-dimensional generator adversarial network was used to simulate contrast-enhanced MRI scans from pre-contrast T1-weighted images. Quantitative assessments of image similarity, error metrics, and Dice coefficient for tumor overlap were performed. Three radiologists, blinded to the contrast method, evaluated image quality, tumor enhancement, and extramural vascular invasion (EMVI) in 104 paired real and simulated scans. Tumor size correlation was analyzed with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), and modified Bland-Altman plots were used to assess agreement. ROC curves evaluated diagnostic performance of EMVI detection, and quality scores were compared using the McNemar test. RESULTS: Simulated scans demonstrated high similarity to real scans (structural similarity index: 0.82, Dice coefficient: 0.86 +/- 0.14 for tumor overlap). Tumor size measurements correlated strongly (ICC: 0.76-0.88), with minimal differences in length (0.11 mm) and depth (0.10 mm). ROC analysis revealed slightly higher AUC values for real scans (0.702, 0.772, 0.713) compared to simulated scans (0.685, 0.694, 0.661) for three radiologists, respectively. Nearly all synthetic scans (98%) were rated diagnostically suitable. CONCLUSION: Deep learning-generated simulated contrast-enhanced MRI scans demonstrated comparability to real scans in terms of tumor size, enhancement area, and image quality, suggesting their potential as a supportive tool for diagnosis and treatment evaluation."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Radiation proctitis (RP) is a frequent and clinically relevant complication of radiotherapy (RT) in cervical cancer (CC). However, effective tools for individualized RP risk prediction remain limited. This study aimed to develop and validate an MRI-based radiomic risk score for early RP prediction in CC patients. METHODS: This retrospective study included 375 CC patients who underwent radical RT. Patients were randomly assigned to training (80%) and validation (20%) cohorts. Radiomics features were extracted from pre-treatment MRI and screened using Mann-Whitney U test, intraclass correlation coefficient, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Logistic regression analyses identified independent predictors of RP, and a clinical-radiomics nomogram was constructed. Model performance was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC), calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Of 1,906 extracted features, 9 were selected to construct the radiomics risk score. Independent predictors of RP included lymphocyte counts >/= 2.6 x 10(9)/L, platelet-lymphocyte ratio >/= 196, rectal mean dose >/= 47.22 Gy, and radiomics risk score>/=-0.4. The nomogram incorporating these factors achieved AUCs of 0.810 (training) and 0.730 (validation), with good calibration and clinical utility demonstrated by DCA. CONCLUSION: The proposed MRI-based radiomic risk score enables accurate, noninvasive prediction of RP in CC patients and provides a practical tool to optimize individualized RT planning and toxicity management."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the predictive value of CT-derived tumor extracellular volume fraction (ECV) for recurrence in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and to develop a comprehensive clinical prediction model. METHODS: This retrospective study included 97 patients with pathologically confirmed NMIBC treated between July 2017 and December 2022. All patients underwent pre-treatment contrast-enhanced CT scans, including unenhanced and delayed phases. Tumor ECV was independently measured by two radiologists. Clinical variables were retrieved from medical records. The primary outcome was tumor recurrence, confirmed by cystoscopy or imaging during follow-up. Univariable analysis identified candidate predictors (P < 0.1), and correlation testing was used to exclude multicollinearity. A logistic regression model was developed using 5-fold stratified cross-validation. Model performance was assessed using the area under the ROC curve (AUC), calibration curves, and recurrence-free survival estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: The recurrence rate was 34.0% over a median follow-up of 38.8 months. ECV values were significantly higher in recurrent cases (35.1 +/- 11.4%) than in non-recurrent cases (30.7 +/- 7.1%, P = 0.024). ECV independently predicted recurrence (OR = 1.072, 95% CI: 1.008-1.140; P = 0.028). Five variables-gender, tumor location, ECV, resection type, and intravesical chemotherapy-were identified as significant predictors. The model achieved an AUC of 0.722 +/- 0.051 with good calibration. Cox proportional hazards regression demonstrated that higher ECV was significantly associated with recurrence-free survival in transurethral resection of bladder tumor patients (HR = 1.031, 95% CI: 1.002-1.061, P = 0.036). CONCLUSION: CT-derived ECV is a promising imaging biomarker for recurrence prediction in NMIBC. The integrated model provides potential risk stratification and supports personalized clinical decision-making."

    "abstract": "Liver tumor diagnosis relies heavily on imaging, and the liver imaging reporting and data system (LI-RADS) provides a structured framework for evaluating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and related entities in at-risk populations. Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly expanded across CT, MRI, and ultrasound/CEUS, yet its clinical credibility depends on adherence to modality-appropriate tasks, robust validation, and alignment with LI-RADS semantics. This narrative review synthesizes methodological patterns, diagnostic performance, and readiness for clinical translation of AI systems designed for liver tumor characterization across major imaging modalities. We examine modality-task alignment-including CT-based differential diagnosis of HCC, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, metastases, and benign mimics; LI-RADS feature detection and category assignment on MRI; LR-M disambiguation on MRI and CEUS; and surveillance-era triage on ultrasound. Evidence quality is appraised through external validation, reader studies, robustness analyses, calibration, and uncertainty reporting. A minimal reporting checklist is provided to support methodological transparency and facilitate reproducibility. Across modalities, AI systems show strong potential to enhance liver tumor diagnosis when they mirror radiologist reasoning, explicitly handle temporal enhancement dynamics, and incorporate clinically relevant priors. Translation into practice will require protocol-aware robustness, calibrated confidence estimates, size-stratified performance reporting, and broader multi-center validation. When developed under these principles, LI-RADS-aligned AI may meaningfully improve consistency, interpretability, and scalability in imaging-based liver cancer care."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including lenvatinib approved for advanced non-medullary thyroid cancer (TC), affect the immune system. As tumor-related inflammation contributes to TC pathogenesis, this study assesses the immunomodulatory effects of lenvatinib, focusing on myeloid cells. METHODS: Peripheral blood was collected from 16 lenvatinib-treated and 15 untreated TC patients (cross-sectional cohort), and from eight patients before and after > 1 month of lenvatinib (longitudinal cohort). Immune profiling included cell subset counts, proteomic analyses, and ex vivo cytokine assays in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocytes. Monocytes from healthy donors were used to evaluate metabolic activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and phagocytosis. Tumor-intrinsic effects of lenvatinib were studied by proteomics and immunophenotyping of the TPC-1 cell line. RESULTS: Lenvatinib increased lymphocytes and reduced neutrophils. In both cohorts, lenvatinib modulated the inflammatory proteome with elevated VEGFA, CCL11, MMP-10, and TRAIL. Monocytes exposed ex vivo to lenvatinib showed reduced production of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. In patients treated with lenvatinib, monocytes displayed increased IL-1Ra and TNF, while PBMCs exhibited enhanced IFN-gamma production. Monocytes from healthy donors displayed reduced glycolysis and increased ROS after lenvatinib exposure. In TPC-1 cells, lenvatinib altered the secretome and upregulated MHC class I, PD-L1, and CD40. CONCLUSIONS: Lenvatinib treatment has broad immunomodulatory effects in patients with TC, including shifts in immune cell populations, changes in the proteome, and reprogramming of cytokine responses. Lenvatinib also impacts monocyte metabolism and tumor cell phenotype. These findings provide insight into the multifaceted immunological activities of lenvatinib and highlight opportunities for treatment strategies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable, this is a noninterventional trial."

The clinical significance of Th7R, including the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors and the prediction of postoperative disease-free survival, has been demonstrated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but not in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In this study, we investigated Th7R expression as a predictive marker in patients with extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) who received chemotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy (n = 47). Results showed that Th7R was positively correlated with progression-free survival (PFS) after treatment and that long-term PFS was observed only in patients with Th7R(high) who were treated with anti-programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody combination therapy. Furthermore, high Th7R levels were associated with significantly better overall survival. Th7R showed a positive correlation with GZMB(-)GZMK(+) precursor exhausted CD8(+) T cells (Tpex), which are known target cells for PD-1 blockade therapy. These findings suggest the presence of the Th7R-Tpex axis. Th7R, which reflects antitumor T-cell immunity, is a useful predictive marker for treatment efficacy in ES-SCLC."

Here, we evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of first-line treatment regimens across different PD-L1 expression, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and T-cell receptor (TCR). METHODS: This study retrospectively recruited 245 patients with AGC. 55 blood samples from 20 patients were prospectively collected before immunotherapy, after two cycles of treatment, and during disease progression. RESULTS: In the CPS < 5 cohort, chemotherapy + PD-1 inhibitor + anti-angiogenic treatment showed a higher progression-free survival (PFS). In the CPS >/= 5 cohort, chemotherapy + PD-1 inhibitor improved median PFS (p = 0.04) and ORR (p = 0.014) over chemotherapy alone. ctDNA analysis revealed that at various time points, patients in the short-PFS group exhibited significantly elevated maxVAF and ctDNA levels. Post-treatment, ctDNA levels decreased in 50% of patients in the long-PFS group, whereas only 25% in the short-PFS group. The short-PFS group had a lower TCR clone count, while no significantly different in the diversity of the TCR repertoire compared with long-PFS groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the different efficacy of first-line treatment regimens across varying levels of PD-L1 expression, and the molecular characteristics of patients with long-term benefits from immunotherapy."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This proof-of-concept, cross-sectional study assessed the feasibility and clinical relevance of detecting circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and RNA (ctRNA) in plasma of patients with thyroid cancer. The analysis was performed concurrently with clinical and biochemical assessment to explore its value as a complementary tool for postoperative surveillance. METHODS: Thirty-four patients whose primary tumors had been molecularly profiled for key driver mutations and gene fusions were enrolled. Using a tumor-informed strategy, digital PCR assays were designed to detect patient-specific alterations in matched plasma ctDNA and ctRNA collected between 2021 and 2023. Molecular findings were correlated with treatment response categories according to the 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines. METHODS: ctDNA and/or ctRNA were detected in all patients with a structurally incomplete response, showing full concordance with imaging findings. In contrast, 91% of patients with an excellent response had undetectable ctDNA/ctRNA, consistent with remission. Among those with indeterminate and biochemical incomplete response group, results were variable: one patient with undetectable Tg exhibited an ETV6::NTRK3 fusion in cfRNA, while two of three with biochemical incomplete response tested negative for ctDNA/ctRNA. CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional analysis demonstrated that liquid biopsy accurately reflected disease activity and showed strong concordance with primary tumor alterations. These findings support its feasibility and clinical potential as an adjunct to conventional monitoring, particularly when Tg measurement or tumor tissue availability is limited. Prospective longitudinal studies are warranted to validate its role in personalized postoperative surveillance of thyroid cancer."

    "abstract": "The NRF2 transcription factor is constitutively active in cancer where it functions to maintain oxidative homeostasis and reprogram cellular metabolism. NRF2-active tumors exhibit NRF2-dependency and resistance to chemo/radiotherapy. Here we characterize VVD-065, a first-in-class NRF2 inhibitor that acts via an unprecedented allosteric molecular glue mechanism. In the absence of stress or mutation, NRF2 is rapidly degraded by the KEAP1-CUL3 ubiquitin-ligase complex. VVD-065 specifically and covalently engages Cys151 on KEAP1, which in turn promotes KEAP1-CUL3 complex formation, leading to enhancement of NRF2 degradation. Previously reported Cys151-directed compounds decrease KEAP1-CUL3 interactions and stabilize NRF2, thus establishing KEAP1_Cys151 as a tunable regulator of the KEAP1-CUL3 complex and NRF2 stability. VVD-065 inhibited NRF2-dependent tumor growth and sensitized cancers to chemo/radiotherapy, supporting an open Phase I clinical trial (NCT05954312)."

    "abstract": "Preeclampsia, defined by hypertension and end organ damage after 20 weeks of gestation, remains a significant cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. This disorder has a diverse clinical presentation and is likely driven by several underlying mechanisms, many remaining poorly understood. However, there is emerging evidence that epigenetic regulators, including histone deacetylases (HDACs), may contribute to the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. Of the many HDACs, HDAC9 is particularly intriguing in the context of preeclampsia due to its decreased presence in preeclamptic placenta and prominent role in controlling trophoblast, vascular, and immune behavior, which are often dysregulated in this condition. This review focuses specifically on HDAC9, detailing its expression patterns, molecular properties, known and hypothesized targets at the maternal-fetal interface, and potential causes of dysregulation. Special emphasis is placed on its impact on trophoblast function, immune signaling, angiogenesis, and G-protein-coupled receptor pathways, which are frequently disrupted in preeclampsia. Although current evidence for altered HDAC9 expression in this disorder is confined to the placenta, its potential role in maternal physiology remains an open and important question. By integrating findings from placental biology and disorders with overlapping pathways such as cardiovascular disease and cancer research, this review aims to establish a framework for understanding how HDAC9 contributes to preeclampsia pathogenesis and to identify promising directions for future investigation and therapeutic development."

    "abstract": "Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is an aggressive, therapy-resistant subtype of prostate cancer characterized by lineage plasticity. While metabolic and signaling molecules are increasingly recognized as modulators of tumor progression, their role in cell fate transition remains unclear. NE tumors produce and accumulate serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates diverse physiological processes. Here, we identify a tumor-intrinsic serotonin axis as key driver of NEPC lineage commitment and progression. NEPC endogenously synthesize serotonin via aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (DDC) and reuptake through the transporter SLC6A4. Mechanistically, high level of intracellular serotonin promotes histone serotonylation at H3K4me3Q5, reconfiguring the H3K4me3 chromatin landscape and downstream gene expression, which drives induced NE differentiation and is associated with suppressed androgen receptor signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of 5-HT synthesis using the FDA-approved DDC inhibitor carbidopa significantly impairs tumor growth and prolongs survival in both genetically engineered and patient-derived xenograft models, highlighting histone serotonylation as a druggable vulnerability in NEPC."

    "abstract": "Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represent an emerging targeted cancer therapy approach. However, their poor cell penetration and instability in vivo pose daunting challenges for wide-spread clinical usage. To enhance the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of PROTACs, we introduced extracellular vesicles (EVs) for in vivo PROTAC delivery, which is leveraged by a novel microfluidic droplet-based EV electro-transfection system (muDES). We previously developed YX968 PROTAC, which can selectively degrade both HDAC3 and HDAC8 in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and effectively suppress the tumour cell growth without provoking global hyperacetylation. In this manuscript, we demonstrated that YX968 loaded EVs via the muDES system can retain the optimal integrity of drug loaded EVs with improved loading efficiency compared to other transfection approaches, which, in turn, significantly enhances the therapeutic function of PROTAC in vivo in TNBC mouse models. Intraperitoneal injections of YX968 loaded EVs led to significantly enhanced intratumoral degradation of HDAC3 and HDAC8 than YX986 alone, which resulted in advanced TNBC tumour inhibition without noticeable tissue toxicity. Such EV-based delivery strategy, with a scalable EV loading approach, enhanced the in vivo PROTAC drug stability and bioavailability and improved tissue penetration and targeting, filling an important gap in the clinical translation of PROTAC-based cancer therapy."

However, the clinical translation of protein-loaded MOFs has been limited by poor colloidal stability and a lack of robust, stimulus-responsive release mechanisms. Here, we present a proof-of-concept colloidally stable nanoparticle system composed of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), ZIF-8 and copper (Cu) or iron (Fe) ions, PAA@Cu/FeBSA@c-ZIF-8, designed for H(2)O(2)-responsive, multimodal therapeutic delivery. Through iterative design, we stabilised protein-loaded ZIF-8 nanoparticles with PAA and doped the system with Cu or Fe to enable Fenton-based H(2)O(2) sensitivity. Upon exposure to biologically relevant H(2)O(2) concentrations (40-100 microM), PAA@CuBSA@c-ZIF-8 and PAA@FeBSA@c-ZIF-8 nanoparticles release encapsulated BSA and the doped transition metal ions, demonstrating potential for protein therapy in tandem with reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cytotoxicity. The PAA@BSA@c-ZIF-8, PAA@CuBSA@c-ZIF-8 and PAA@FeBSA@c-ZIF-8 exhibit consistent physiochemical properties across independent operators and scales, including particle size, zeta potential, and cargo release, as well as cytotoxicity. Importantly, we identify ROS production, measured by 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate response, as a key critical quality attribute correlating with therapeutic potency. This work establishes a reproducible, H(2)O(2)-responsive nanoplatform towards application in cancer therapy and supports the broader use of quality attribute metrics in nanoparticle development."

However, their potential as targeted inhibitors of cancer-related proteins remains underexplored. This study reports the design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel benz/imidazole-2-thione/selone-based triazoles, focusing on cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), a key regulator of cancer cell proliferation. The compounds were synthesized via a multistep approach involving imidazolium salt intermediates, followed by sulfur or selenium incorporation. Structural confirmation was achieved using FT-IR, NMR, and mass spectrometry. Molecular docking against CDK1, TERT, and VEGFR2 revealed strong binding affinities (-9.7 to -7.3 kcal/mol), with CDK1 selected for further in vitro study using MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed stable CDK1 binding for Compounds 2, 4, and 9, although Compound 9 showed conformational instability after 60 ns. ADMET profiling indicated favorable drug-likeness and permeability but highlighted metabolic liabilities and hERG inhibition risks, particularly for Compounds 4 and 9. The target prediction and pathway enrichment analyses predict that benz/imidazole-2-thione/selone-based triazoles exert their pharmacological effects primarily through the regulation of GPCR signaling pathways, likely via direct interaction with key regulators such as RGS8 and RGS4. In vitro assays demonstrated dose-dependent cytotoxicity, with Compound 4 showing the highest potency (IC(50) = 106.12 +/- 1.03 microg/mL), followed by 9 and 2. These findings suggest that benz/imidazole-2-thione/selone-based triazoles are promising CDK1 inhibitors and support their further optimization as targeted breast cancer therapies."

We investigated Gem/Cis/nab-P efficacy and identified molecular subgroups with clinical benefit. APPROACH RESULTS: This prospective observational cohort study (NCT04871321) enrolled 119 patients with advanced BTC who received Gem/Cis/nab-P from July 2021 to December 2022. Of these, 108 were included in genomic and transcriptomic analyses of pretreatment tumor samples that met quality control criteria. Among 119 patients, 39.5% had intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 37.0% extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 23.5% gallbladder cancer. Most patients had metastatic disease (68.9%). At a median follow-up of 23.7 months, the median progression-free survival was 8.3 months and median overall survival 19.8 months. Grade >/=3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 70 patients (58.8%), and dose reduction was required in 99.2%. Frequent genetic alterations were TP53 (53.7%), KRAS (29.6%), and CDKN2A (20.4%), with TP53 mutations being significantly associated with worse outcomes. Transcriptomic analysis identified four molecular subtypes: cholangiocyte-like, stromal, metabolic, and inflammatory-proliferative. The cholangiocyte-like subtype, marked by increased cholangiocyte markers, had the most favorable prognosis. Stromal and metabolic subtypes showed moderate outcomes, characterized by a fibroblast-rich stroma with activated angiogenesis and enriched metabolic pathways, respectively. The inflammatory-proliferative subtype had the worst prognosis, with cell cycle and inflammatory activation, and an exhausted immune microenvironment. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the clinical activity of Gem/Cis/nab-P in advanced BTC and highlighted that biology-driven patient stratification based on genomic and transcriptomic features may provide important prognostic information."

This study aimed to compare effectiveness and safety between HIPEC and conventional IP in OC. METHODS: This retrospective real-world study analyzed 606 patients with stage Ⅱ-IV OC who received HIPEC or IP following cytoreductive surgery between 2013 and 2024. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Overall survival and adverse events were secondary endpoints. The study used inverse probability of treatment propensity-score weighting. We also conducted sensitivity analyses to evaluate result robustness and subgroup analyses to explore potential effect modification. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 26 months, disease progression occurred in 40.6% of patients in the HIPEC group and 55.0% in the IP group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79; p = 0.103). Mortality rates were 13.2% and 22.5%, respectively (HR 0.83; p = 0.434), showing no significant differences in progression and survival between the two groups. Exploratory subgroup analyses suggested a trend toward improved progression-free outcomes with HIPEC, particularly among patients with BRCA wild-type or BRCA1-mutated tumors and early postoperative perfusion. Hypoalbuminemia was the most common event in both groups (HIPEC 27.2%; IP 15.6%). HIPEC group had more abdominal distension and wound dehiscence, whereas IP patients experienced nausea and rash more frequently. CONCLUSIONS: HIPEC did not significantly improve survival over conventional IP in the overall population, but showed greater benefit in specific subgroups, underscoring the importance of individualized intraperitoneal chemotherapy strategies in OC."

We examined racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic patterns in guideline-discordant underscreening and overscreening according to guidelines based on age and mortality risk. METHODS: We used 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data and major screening guidelines to define screening participation. Underscreening captured mammography in the past 2 years among women aged 50-74. Overscreening included any mammography beyond age 74 or among women aged 50+ with high mortality risk. We used modified Poisson regression to examine screening by race/ethnicity, regular healthcare provider access, and metropolitan, educational and marital status. RESULTS: Among 88,326 women aged 50-74, compared to non-Hispanic (NH) White, NH American Indian/Alaskan Native (adjusted Prevalence Ratio (aPR)=0.88, 95% CI=0.79-0.97) and NH women of unknown race (aPR=0.86, 95% CI=0.78-0.94) were less likely to be screened, while NH Black (aPR=1.11, 95% CI=1.09-1.13) women were more likely. Among 31,477 women 75+, NH Black women were more likely to be screened than NH White women (aPR=1.07, 95% CI=1.01-1.14). Among women with high mortality risk, NH Black (aPR=1.20, 95% CI=1.12-1.28) women were more likely to be screened than NH White women. Screening was lower among women with more limited socioeconomic resources regardless of age or mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS: Findings reveal social drivers of underscreening and overscreening and the need for equitable BC screening delivery. IMPACT: This work calls for strengthening implementation and de-implementation efforts to optimize BC screening."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Red meat consumption is a risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) and has been linked to tumor alkylating DNA damage. rs16906252-T is a cis expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) variant associated with silencing of MGMT, a central alkylating damage repair gene. We hypothesize that rs16906252-T carriers are predisposed to alkylating damage mutations. METHODS: We conducted mutational signature deconvolution of CRC whole-exome sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n = 540), the Nurses' Health Studies/ Health Professional Follow-up Study (NHS/HPFS, n = 900) as well as non-western samples from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (COCA-CN, n = 295); and examined the relationship of rs16906252-T with putative alkylation-dependent tumor mutations. Leveraging lifestyle data from NHS/HPFS, we also investigated the interaction between red meat consumption and rs16906252-T. RESULTS: Among CRC patients, rs16906252-T carriers exhibited higher tumor alkylating damage compared to non-carriers. In the general population, rs16906252-T is largely absent in individuals with East Asian ancestries, and we consistently find a negligible contribution of alkylating damage in CRC patients with East Asian ancestries. We show that the alkylating mutational signature's carcinogenicity is mainly mediated by KRAS G12D and G13D mutations. We also observe a synergistic effect of rs16906252-T with high pre-diagnosis red meat intake for tumor alkylating damage. CONCLUSIONS: MGMT rs16906252-T carriers are predisposed to CRC oncogenic alkylating damage which is potentiated by red meat intake. IMPACT: Our results support a causal relationship between red meat and CRC and may inform tailored dietary and screening guidelines for CRC prevention."

    "abstract": "With improved survival, non-cancer causes of death have become increasingly relevant in cancer care. Excess non-cancer mortality may reflect treatment-related toxicity, comorbidities, shared risk factors, and psychological distress. This scoping review aimed to map the population-based evidence on the causes of death in patients with cancer and identify research gaps. PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Scopus were searched until April 2025. A total of 203 population-based studies using standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) to compare cause-specific mortality among cancer patients with that of the general population were included. Non-cancer mortality was consistently elevated among patients with cancer (median SMR 1.60; interquartile range (IQR) 1.24-2.51), especially during the first year post-diagnosis (3.42; 1.45-6.92), and remained higher over 10 years post-diagnosis (1.51; 1.08-5.49). Younger patients and those with advanced-stage cancers demonstrated higher non-cancer mortality. Among specific causes, cardiovascular disease (1.37; 1.09-2.34), suicide (1.73; 1.32-2.77), stroke (1.36; 0.98-2.17), infectious diseases in general (2.20; 1.35-4.16), septicemia (2.84; 1.64-5.47), and pneumonia/influenza (1.57; 1.08-2.69) were consistently elevated. Patients with cancer have demonstrated substantial non-cancer mortality. These findings identify priority areas for targeted prevention and further investigation into cause-specific mortality patterns beyond cancer-related deaths to improve outcomes."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that coffee consumption may improve colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis. However, its relevance with respect to dose-response, coffee type, and tumor stage remains unclear. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library through May 31, 2025, to identify studies quantifying coffee intake among CRC patients. Meta-analyses using random-effects models and dose-response analysis were performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and recurrence. Subgroup analyses were stratified by daily intake level, coffee type (caffeinated, decaffeinated, total), and CRC stage. RESULTS: Four prospective cohort studies including 5,442 CRC patients (53% male, 47% female) were analyzed with the following disease stage distribution: I (18%), II (18%), III (39%), IV (21%), unspecified (4%). Coffee consumption was significantly associated with improved OS (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.71-0.85), PFS (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.94), and reduced recurrence (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66-0.91), showing a 4% reduction in hazard per additional cup per day across all outcomes. The strongest OS benefit was observed in stage III disease (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.41-0.81), corresponding to a 10% reduction per cup. CONCLUSIONS: Coffee consumption is associated with improved survival and reduced recurrence in CRC patients in a dose-dependent and stage-specific manner. IMPACT: This meta-analysis demonstrates stage- and type-specific survival benefits in CRC, which may inform more individualized dietary recommendations. It also underscores the need for validation in diverse cohorts and mechanistic studies."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer survivors often experience reduced health-related quality of life (QOL). Diet is related to QOL in the general population and prostate cancer survivors, with benefits observed from greater consumption of a plant-based diet post-treatment. We examined whether post-diagnostic Western and prudent dietary patterns were associated with cancer-specific QOL. METHODS: We studied 1,032 participants in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer (2005-2014). Diet scores were cumulatively averaged from validated food frequency questionnaires post-diagnosis. QOL was assessed with the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Short Form (EPIC-26) 2-5 years after diagnosis/treatment (2010-2016). We assessed associations between the two diet patterns and cancer-specific QOL domains (sexual function, urinary irritation/obstruction, urinary incontinence, bowel function, hormonal/vitality function), adjusting for patient, tumor, and lifestyle characteristics. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was 75 years; 93% had clinically localized cancer. Higher Western diet scores were associated with worse bowel function by 3 points (p-trend=0.02), below the 4-6 point threshold for clinical relevance, with suggestive trends among radiation-treated patients (p-trend=0.07). Higher prudent diet scores tended to be associated with better bowel function (p-trend=0.09). Neither diet score was associated with bowel function among patients receiving radical prostatectomy or active surveillance. There were no associations with sexual, urinary, or hormonal/vitality function. CONCLUSIONS: Among survivors of non-metastatic prostate cancer, dietary patterns were largely unrelated to cancer-specific QOL across domains and treatment subgroups. IMPACT: In the 2-5-year window, QOL was largely unaffected by post-diagnostic dietary patterns, warranting further research with longer follow-up to assess potential latency."

METHODS: All consecutive subjects who attended our clinic to underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-ultrasound fusion biopsy due to highly suspicious findings on MRI for prostate cancer (PCa) and met the inclusion criteria were enrolled into our prospective study between October 2020 and January 2025. ROSE was performed concurrently in the same operating room with MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy. For each lesion with Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 4-5, one to two additional needle passes were taken for ROSE, in addition to the standard biopsy. The results of ROSE during the biopsy were recorded. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of ROSE were assessed using paraffin-embedded histopathology of the biopsy specimens as the gold standard. RESULTS: A total of 313 lesions with PI-RADS 4-5 from 147 patients were ultimately included in this study. All biopsies were performed smoothly, with no severe complications occurring postoperatively. 192 lesions were pathologically diagnosed with PCa, yielding a positive detection rate of 61.3% (192/313). With paraffin-embedded histopathology of the biopsy specimens serving as the gold standard, the sensitivity of ROSE for detecting PCa was 71.9% (138/192), specificity was 100% (121/121), accuracy was 82.7% (259/313), positive predictive value was 100% (138/138), and negative predictive value was 69.1% (121/175). CONCLUSIONS: The application of ROSE technology in the diagnosis during prostate biopsy is accurate and reliable, with specificity and positive predictive value both reaching 100%."

We report updated efficacy and safety results from the disease-free survival (DFS) final and overall survival (OS) second interim analyses, with >/= 5 years of follow-up in Japanese patients. Patients who received 1-4 21-day chemotherapy cycles after surgery were randomized 1:1 to receive atezolizumab 1200 mg every 3 weeks (</= 16 cycles) or BSC. Of 149 patients enrolled, 117 were randomized to the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (atezolizumab n = 59; BSC n = 58). At data cutoff (January 26, 2024), unstratified hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for DFS in the atezolizumab versus BSC arms were 0.54 (0.28-1.07) in the stage II-IIIA programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor cell (TC) >/= 1% (n = 74), 0.64 (0.27-1.52) in the stage II-IIIA PD-L1 TC 1%-49% (n = 34), 0.52 (0.17-1.54) in the stage II-IIIA PD-L1 TC >/= 50% (n = 40), 0.58 (0.34-1.00) in the stage II-IIIA all-randomized (n = 113), and 0.57 (0.34-0.98) in the ITT populations.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen in cystic fibrosis-related chronic rhinosinusitis (CF-CRS) that produces phenazine metabolites pyocyanin and 1-hydroxyphenazine (1-HP), which may have detrimental effects on mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca(2+) signaling, and apoptosis. However, prior studies utilized lung cancer cells or dissociated animal cells. We sought to better define human nasal epithelial responses to phenazines, including the role of Ca(2+). METHODS: Live cell imaging was used to measure Ca(2+) and mitochondrial function in RPMI2650 nasal carcinoma cells and primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) cultured in submersion and at air-liquid interface (ALI). Gene expression was measured by quantitative PCR. Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was quantified by high-speed imaging. RESULTS: Pyocyanin, but not 1-HP, increased mitochondrial Ca(2+) dependent on phospholipase C and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) release, correlating with protein kinase C activation. Mitochondrial membrane potential decreased and mitochondrial ROS increased with both pyocyanin and 1-HP in a Ca(2+)-independent manner. Both pyocyanin and 1-HP decreased viability of RPMI2650s and other squamous carcinoma cell lines over 24 h, whereas HNECs survived, possibly due to differential regulation of protein homeostasis genes, including activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Mitochondrial ROS was enhanced in CF-CRS ALIs, which may explain why pyocyanin reduced CBF in CF but not non-CF ALIs. CONCLUSIONS: Ca(2+) signaling is not required for phenazine mitochondrial toxicity. The greater sensitivity of cancer cells to phenazine cytotoxicity necessitates use of primary cells when studying host responses to bacterial phenazines. Enhanced ROS production and ciliotoxicity in CF-CRS may contribute to susceptibility to P. aeruginosa infection."

    "abstract": "The development of smart, selective, and multifunctional nanotherapeutics is crucial for advancing next-generation cancer treatments. In this study, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoclusters (SPIONCs) were coated with mesoporous silica, functionalized with folic acid (FA), and co-loaded with curcumin (CUR) and capecitabine (CAPE) to create a novel nanocarrier system. To enhance cellular internalisation, magnetophoresis was applied before exposure of the cells to cold atmospheric plasma (CAP). The resulting FA-conjugated, CUR and CAPE-loaded nanoclusters were evaluated in vitro in MCF-7 breast cancer and HME-1 normal epithelial cells at varying CAP exposure durations (0, 10, and 20 s) and incubation times (24 and 48 h). This is the first report demonstrating the co-loading of CUR and CAPE into FA-functionalised mesoporous silica-coated magnetic nanoclusters. Drug release studies revealed significantly enhanced release profiles under acidic conditions (pH 5.0 and 6.5), mimicking lysosomal and tumour microenvironments, compared to physiological pH (7.4). Drug-loaded nanoclusters exhibited substantially higher cytotoxicity than the controls with no loading, with a more pronounced effect in MCF-7 cells. Notably, the combined treatment of CAP and CUR-CAPE loaded NCs showed a synergistic cytotoxic effect. IC(50) values, after 10 s CAP exposure and 24 h incubation, decreased to 0.43 microg mL(-1) for MCF-7 cells and 37 microg mL(-1) for HME-1 cells. The elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by CAP played a key role in the observed cytotoxic effects, and both CUR and CAPE were found to enhance this process through ROS-related and potentially additional molecular pathways. These findings highlight the potential of CAP-assisted multicomponent nanocarriers as a promising platform for effective cancer therapy."

The micelles were characterized using a particle size analyzer, a crystallography analyzer, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The morphology was screened using a scanning electron microscope. In vitro release profiles of curcumin from CS-NPGS showed a sustained release without rapid burst. Treating triple negative MDA-MB-231 cell lines with all micelles remarkably exhibited dose-dependent toxicity and inhibited the cell proliferation. Epifluorescence was used to evaluate the morphology of the treated cells by using various stains. The IC50 values of the curcumin-loaded micelles against triple negative MDA-MB-231 cells were 10.85, 5.43, and 5.43 mug/mL for CS-NPGS-1, CS-NPGS-2, and CS-NPGS-3, respectively, lower than the one of free curcumin (21.7 mug/mL). An in vivo rat oral pharmacokinetic study showed 13.25x, 16.43x, and 18.51x increases in Cmax for CS-NPGS-1, CS-NPGS-2, and CS-NPGS-3 compared to curcuminoid powder, respectively. The relative bioavailability of CS-NPGS-1, CS-NPGS-2, and CS-NPGS-3 was 155.21%, 504.82%, and 687.83% compared to CS, respectively. The aqueous solubility of encapsulated CS-NPGS micelles is considerably improved, allowing for more localized drug delivery and a superior treatment alternative for residual cancer tumors."

    "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated a higher prevalence of keratinocyte carcinomas (KC) on sun-exposed areas, particularly for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) compared to basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Few studies in the United States (US) have compared the prevalence of BCC to SCC by anatomical location. The aim of this study was to determine the KC prevalence in a Midwestern US population standardised by relative tumour density (RTD) per anatomical area, which has not been previously reported in the US. Data was collected from Veterans Affairs' patients with biopsy-proven KCs from October 1999 to September 2020. KCs were divided into BCCs and SCCs. RTD was calculated by standardising frequency of occurrence in a location by body surface area. The proportion of BCCs to SCCs for each location was also analysed. A total of 31 663 KCs (17 776 BCCs and 13 887 SCCs) were identified in 10 933 patients, with the majority on the head and neck. BCCs were more likely overall on the trunk and upper arms than SCCs. SCCs were more common on the hands, forearms, genitals/perineum/perianal area, and ears. Both BCC and SCC occurred more frequently over sun-exposed areas when controlling for body surface area of the location. Higher proportions of BCCs were found on sun-protected areas when compared to SCCs. The relative preponderance of SCCs on the genitals/perineum/perianal area may be due to human papillomavirus."

    "abstract": "Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, emphasizing the need for advanced and accurate diagnostic tools. This research paper focuses on the application of a Transfer Learning model for the detection of breast cancer in mammography images. Leveraging the power of deep learning, Transfer Learning enables the utilization of pre-trained models on large datasets, optimizing performance even with limited data availability. The study employs a diverse dataset comprising mammography images from various sources, ensuring a comprehensive representation of breast cancer cases. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, pre-trained on a vast dataset, is fine-tuned using the mammography dataset to harness its feature extraction capabilities for breast cancer detection. This approach allows the model to learn intricate patterns and abnormalities indicative of malignancies. Key steps involve the pre-processing of mammography images to enhance the quality and extraction of relevant features through the Transfer Learning model. The research investigates the model's efficacy in distinguishing between benign and malignant cases, evaluating its accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. The research proposed EfficientNet B3 with a DenseNet transfer learning model for classifying mammography images into benign or malignant categories. Also, the impact of varying architectures and hyperparameters on the model's performance is explored for optimization. Results demonstrate promising outcomes, with the Transfer Learning model exhibiting a high degree of accuracy in breast cancer detection. The model's ability to generalize across diverse datasets underscores its robustness and potential for real-world clinical applications. Visions gained from this research contribute to the ongoing discourse on the integration of advanced technologies in breast cancer diagnostics. This research signifies a crucial step towards enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer detection, emphasizing the potential of Transfer Learning in revolutionizing mammography-based diagnostic approaches. Findings show that the EfficientNet-B3 and DenseNet have loss values ranging between 0.9, while VGG16's loss values are significantly higher, ranging from 7. The findings hold implications for improving early detection, facilitating timely interventions, and ultimately advancing outcomes for individuals at risk of breast cancer."

Data from underrepresented populations, such as Turkiye, remains limited. We retrospectively analyzed 895 individuals referred for hereditary cancer evaluation between 2019 and 2025 who underwent multigene panel testing. Germline CHEK2 variants were identified using the Hereditary Cancer Solution Kit (Sophia Genetics) and classified per ACMG guidelines. Clinical, tumor, and histopathological data were reviewed. Twenty-four carriers (83.3% female) were detected: 45.8% harbored pathogenic, 41.6% likely pathogenic, and 12.5% variant of uncertain significance. Breast cancer was the most frequent (66.6%), followed by bladder cancer (8.3%), with isolated cases of ovarian, cervical, lung, papillary thyroid cancers, parathyroid adenoma, and thymoma. Missense variants predominated (75%), clustering in the FHA (66.6%) and kinase (33.4%) domains. Recurrent c.470T > C and c.1427C > T variants comprised 41.6% of all cases.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) offer immense potential in reproductive medicine, particularly for males who lack germ cells and cannot achieve biological parenthood through conventional ARTs. Early efforts to derive human germ cells from stem cells were hindered by low efficiency, subpar characterization, and the lack of standardized differentiation approaches. However, recent advancements have led to the development of defined protocols that mimic early embryonic development and allow the specification of transcriptomically and epigenetically validated human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs). Current research focuses on maturing hPGCLCs in vitro, particularly within 3D culture systems that resemble their physiological microenvironment, with the aim of producing transplantable hiPSC-derived spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) or differentiating them to sperm. At the same time, researchers are also testing whether hiPSCs generated from infertile patients can resume germline differentiation. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: This narrative review aimed to summarize the key efforts and remaining challenges in differentiating male germ cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), with a particular focus on defined and validated protocols for hPGCLC specification. In parallel, we addressed key safety and ethical considerations that must be accounted for the development of clinical applications. A deeper understanding of the approaching therapeutic use of hiPSCs in reproductive medicine is essential for developing novel regenerative fertility strategies. SEARCH METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for studies attempting germ cell differentiation from hPSCs using relevant keywords ('stem cells', 'human pluripotent stem cells', 'human embryonic stem cells', 'human induced pluripotent stem cells', 'somatic cell reprogramming', 'infertility', 'germline', 'spermatogenesis', 'germ cells', and 'primordial germ cells'). No time period restriction was established. Studies with an exclusive focus on female germline differentiation were excluded. To maintain a human-focused perspective, only key animal studies are presented. OUTCOMES: The literature reveals a clear segregation among protocols for deriving germ cells from hPSCs, particularly between earlier studies lacking standardized differentiation conditions and characterization, and the most recent, defined protocols having transcriptomic and epigenetic validation against in vivo hPGCs. Moreover, during the last decade, the field has seen remarkable progress, with multiple efforts aimed at maturing hPGCLCs, closely recapitulating late male embryonic germline development. Additionally, hiPSCs derived from male patients at risk of infertility, particularly those without underlying genetic syndromes, generally retain the capacity for early germline commitment. While attempts at maturating patient germ cells beyond the hPGCLC state remain limited, the rapid pace of discovery and refinement in recent years suggests that further breakthroughs, including clinically applicable fertility restoration strategies, are likely to be achieved in the near future. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The ability to generate hiPSCs from infertile patients and to specify them into hPGCLCs supports the feasibility of obtaining hiPSC-derived SSCs for future therapeutic use. These advances raise important ethical, regulatory, and societal questions that must be actively discussed among researchers, clinicians, policymakers, and the general public to ensure responsible and equitable access to these technologies.

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy in the digestive tract. Serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2) plays a critical role in CRC progression, and its regulatory mechanisms warrant further investigation. The regulatory role of SHMT2 was investigated by assessing cell viability and ferroptosis. RNA methylation detection was performed to determine the predominant methylation modification types. The interaction between GEMIN5 (which binds to the m(7)G cap) was analyzed through RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and dual luciferase reporter assays. Finally, the synergistic regulation of GEMIN5 and SHMT2 on the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway was examined. SHMT2 was highly expressed in CRC tissues, and its inhibition suppressed cell viability while promoting ferroptosis. Quantitative analysis revealed significantly elevated m(7)G levels in CRC cells. GEMIN5 expression positively correlated with SHMT2 levels in CRC, and GEMIN5 overexpression increased m(7)G modification levels of SHMT2 mRNA. RIP assays demonstrated that SHMT2 mRNA could be enriched in GEMIN5 complexes, with GEMIN5 overexpression inhibiting SHMT2 mRNA degradation. SHMT2 overexpression counteracted the effects of GEMIN5 knockdown, while GEMIN5 overexpression prominently reversed the regulatory effects of SHMT2 knockdown on beta-catenin and GSK3beta protein expression. GEMIN5-mediated m(7)G modification stabilizes high SHMT2 expression, which inhibits CRC cell ferroptosis and activates the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in vitro."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dietary nitrate, through conversion to nitric oxide, which supports vascular and nervous system function, may lower dementia risk but may also form neurodegenerative N-nitrosamines, depending on the nitrate source. METHODS: We investigated associations between source-specific nitrate and nitrite intake and incident and early-onset dementia (<65 years) in 54,804 dementia-free participants from the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health Cohort Study over  approximately 27 years. Nitrate and nitrite intakes were derived from food frequency questionnaires and nitrate and nitrite databases. RESULTS: Higher plant-sourced nitrate intake was non-linearly associated with lower rates of incident dementia (fifth vs first quintile hazard ratio 95% confidence interval: 0.90 [0.83, 0.98]), while increased risk was seen for higher intakes of animal-sourced, additive-permitted meat-sourced, and tap water-sourced nitrate. Similar associations were seen for source-specific nitrite intake and were more pronounced for early-onset dementia. No clear effect modification was observed. DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the importance of nitrate source in dementia risk and warrant further investigation. HIGHLIGHTS: Plant nitrate is associated with a lower risk of incident and early-onset dementia. Animal and tap water nitrate are associated with an increased risk of dementia. Encouraging consumption of plant-based nitrate sources may lower risk of dementia."

    "abstract": "Colon cancer is one of the five most common cancers worldwide, leading to more than 500.000 deaths annually. It is known that the prevalence of colon cancer increases in parallel with increasing age, which is often associated with an increase in the number of concomitant diseases. The latter, both individually and in combination with each other, can have an impact on the safety of performing surgical interventions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between somatic status and the incidence of postoperative complications in comorbid patients with locally advanced colon cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was prospective in nature. The study included 254 patients who underwent surgery for locally advanced colon cancer (cT4N0M0, cT1-4 N1-2 M0). 66.1% of patients had stage II of the disease, 33.9% of patients had stage III. Information on somatic status was analyzed for all patients with the calculation of the Charlson comorbidity index, as well as on the presence of complications in the early and late postoperative period. Statistical data analysis was performed using the RStudio software (version 2024.12.1+563) in the R programming language. RESULTS: Various complications of surgical interventions in patients with locally advanced colon cancer were noted in 9.8% of cases. A total of 42 complications were identified in 25 patients. The most common complication was the formation of a postoperative hernia, which occurred in 11 patients (44.0% of all complications and 4.3% of the total sample). The second most common complication was seromas, which formed in 9 patients (36.0% of all complications and 3.5% of the total sample). In the course of a multifactorial logistic regression analysis, it was shown that the independent risk factors for postoperative complications in comorbid patients with locally advanced colon cancer are the duration of surgery and the Charlson comorbidity index. Thus, an operation duration of more than 240 minutes increases the chance of postoperative complications by 3.1 times (OR=3.100; 95% CI=1.250-7.681; p=0.015), and the Charlson comorbidity index of 9 or more increases the chance of postoperative complications by 4.927 times (OR=4.927; 95% CI=1.340-18.122; p=0.016). CONCLUSION: The somatic status of patients has a significant impact on the postoperative complications of radical surgical interventions in patients with locally advanced colon cancer. At the same time, it is most appropriate not to evaluate individual concomitant diseases, but a comprehensive assessment of somatic status using the Charlson comorbidity index, which, along with the duration of surgery, acts as an independent predictor of postoperative complications."

Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) grade B/C was detected in 29 (32.6%) cases. Postoperative chemotherapy was administered to 43 patients (gemcitabine-based therapy - 27, capecitabine alone - 15, capecitabine/oxaliplatin combination - 1). The median overall survival was 33 months, disease-free survival - 19 months. Among patients selected for assessment of long-term results (n=79), the median OS was 37 months, DFS - 30 months. Retroperitoneal invasion (RPI), pancreatic invasion (PI), perineural invasion (PNI), moderate/poor differentiation, R1 resection, retroperitoneal lymph node (LN) involvement worsened long-term results in multivariate analysis, regional LN involvement and elevated CA 19-9 - in univariate analysis. Accumulation of factors worsened prognosis. Postoperative chemotherapy improved OS (median OS 35 months vs. 16.5, p=0.035) in patients with two or more negative prognostic factors. Chemotherapy mode did not affect prognosis. CONCLUSION: Retroperitoneal, pancreatic and perineural invasion, R1 resection, moderate/poor tumor differentiation, lymph node involvement and elevated CA 19-9 are negative prognostic factors in CBD cancer. Postoperative capecitabine monotherapy is justified in patients with two or more negative factors."

    "abstract": "Papillary cancer comprises 85-90% of malignant thyroid tumors. About 50% of new cases of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) are malignant tumors up to 1 cm in size. In Europe, their proportion increased from 18% to 40% over 30 years. This is explained by better diagnosis at earlier stages of disease due to higher quality of ultrasound diagnosis. According to the WHO classification, tumor </=1 cm is defined as papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC). In the absence of regional or distant metastases, either follow-up or hemithyroidectomy is recommended. However, tumor metastasis to lymph nodes of the neck is quite common that can contribute to recurrence. Modern ultrasonic diagnosis allows effective preclinical detection of lymph node metastases. In this report, we consider the methods of recurrence detection using retrospective preoperative data in patients who underwent hemithyroidectomy and in whom treatment outcomes are known (presence/absence of recurrence)."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE. T: O improve functional outcomes after surgical treatment of T1-2 gastric cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 11 patients (5 males, 6 females; mean age 73+/-8.6 years) with T1-2N0M0 gastric cancer who underwent middle segmental gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy. Selection criteria included tumor localization in gastric body, resection margins >/=6 cm, confirmed by intraoperative endoscopy. Proximal and distal gastric stumps were formed with anti-reflux fundoplication cuff. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30 and STO22 questionnaires. RESULTS: No postoperative complications or mortality were observed. Mean surgery time was 220.4+/-54.4 min, blood loss - 390+/-186.8 ml. All resections were radical (R0). In long-term period (24.2+/-17.5 months), recurrence occurred in 1 patient (T3N0M0). Reflux esophagitis was absent; mild dumping syndrome was detected in 1 patient. QoL scores after surgery (functional scale - 92.7; symptom scale - 23.8) surpassed those after gastrectomy, pylorus-preserving, and distal subtotal resections. CONCLUSION: Middle segmental gastrectomy demonstrates oncological adequacy and functional benefits (sphincter preservation, reduced reflux, and dumping syndrome). Further studies are required to confirm long-term outcomes."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Sarcopenia, characterized by the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, has been linked to poor oncological outcomes. This study aimed to assess the relationship between sarcopenia-defined through combined radiological and biochemical assessments-and survival outcomes in patients with rectal cancer. METHODS: Sarcopenia was evaluated using radiological measurements of skeletal muscle mass, visceral and subcutaneous fat tissue volumes, and biochemical parameters including albumin, protein, and Fib-4 index levels. RESULTS: Deceased patients were older than survivors (mean 70 vs. 63years). Elevated Fib-4 scores (3.0-4.9) were mainly observed in non-operated patients with poor tumor regression. Post-treatment albumin levels were significantly higher in patients with complete response (42.0+/-3.5mg/dL) than in those with regression score-3 (37.3+/-8.7mg/dL) and non-operated patients (34.9+/-8.3mg/dL; p < 0.001). Pre-treatment skeletal muscle mass, subcutaneous fat, and visceral fat volumes were greater in survivors (22.3+/-7.0cm3 vs 19.2+/-7.0cm3, 27.7+/-20.3cm3 vs 18.7+/-14.0cm3 and 49.7+/-37.8cm3 vs 29.9+/-20.5cm3 respectively) than in deceased patients (p < 0.05). Larger tissue volumes-muscle>/=16.95cm3, visceral fat>/=39.35cm3, and subcutaneous fat>/=17.65 cm3 were associated with longer overall survival. In univariate analysis, older age, low albumin, high Fib-4 index, and reduced tissue volumes predicted poorer survival, while multivariate analysis identified low post-treatment albumin as the only independent prognostic factor (HR 0.28, 95% CI:0.12-0.65, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia is associated with decreased overall survival in rectal cancer. In patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy, lower volumes of muscle mass, subcutaneous fat, and visceral fat, together with lower albumin and protein levels and higher Fib-4 scores, may serve as predictive markers of sarcopenia."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare nanocarbon suspension and methylene blue as lymphatic tracers in inguinal lymph node mapping and sorting during surgery for penile cancer. METHODS: This multicentre study included 62 patients (2020-2024); 33 underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and 29 underwent inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND). SLNB patients were divided into control (no tracer), nanocarbon, or methylene blue groups (ChiCTR2200063416). Outcomes included lymph node detection rate (LNDR), number of lymph nodes per side (NOLNPIS), metastasis positive rate (PROLM), and operation time (OT). ILND patients were grouped into nanocarbon-assisted sorting (NLFLNSG) or traditional sorting (TLNSG), with comparisons of NOLNPIS, PROLM, OT, and lymphatic leakage rate (PLLR). RESULTS: Both tracers effectively stained lymph nodes without adverse effects. During SLNB, methylene blue significantly improved LNDR (p = 0.013), NOLNPIS (p = 0.015), and reduced OT (p < 0.0001) compared to control, but PROLM showed no difference. In ILND, NLFLNSG yielded more lymph nodes than TLNSG (p = 0.043), with no significant differences in PROLM, OT, or PLLR. CONCLUSION: Nanocarbon and methylene blue are safe and effective for lymphatic tracing in penile cancer SLNB, improving node identification and surgical efficiency. Nanocarbon-assisted sorting in ILND increases lymph node retrieval, aiding pathological staging and treatment guidance."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent mental health conditions, yet frequently remain undiagnosed. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is one of the most widely used self-report questionnaires for assessing both momentary (state) and general (trait) anxiety severity. As it has also been considered for screening, it is essential to evaluate its accuracy in identifying undiagnosed anxiety disorders. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for detecting anxiety disorders in adults. We specifically aimed to determine accuracy estimates for the full range of sum score cut-offs and grouped our analyses by the STAI's two subscales, State Anxiety subscale (STAI-S) and Trait Anxiety subscale (STAI-T), assessing the target condition category 'any anxiety disorder' (AAD) as well as 'generalised anxiety disorder' (GAD) as one of its specific conditions. SEARCH METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search in Ovid Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed-not-MEDLINE, and PsycINFO (1990 to 15 May 2024). We also screened reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies of adults that administered the STAI irrespective of mode, with no limitations on the language or number of participants. We excluded studies on adults seeking help in mental health settings or participants who were recruited specifically due to mental health symptoms in other settings. Eligible studies administered the STAI as the index test and used a structured or semi-structured diagnostic interview as the reference standard, allowing the creation of 2 x 2 contingency tables. We excluded studies following a case-control design and studies with a time lag of more than four weeks between the STAI and the reference standard. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of articles, extracted data, and evaluated the methodological quality using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool, version 2 (QUADAS-2). We applied the multiple thresholds model to obtain summary sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) across all cut-offs (from >/= 20 to 80). Using the multiple-threshold summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) as an overall measure of accuracy. MAIN RESULTS: We included 12 studies from 11 countries with a total of 2525 participants, of whom 475 had an anxiety disorder. Of these, 11 studies assessed the state anxiety subscale, STAI-S (2042 participants) and eight studies assessed the trait anxiety subscale, STAI-T (1906 participants). The diagnoses made by the reference standards were all ultimately based on criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) administered in seven studies and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID) in five studies. Eleven studies were performed in clinical settings for a variety of specific conditions (e.g. epilepsy, pregnancy), while one study included partners of cancer patients. Most studies showed a high or unclear risk of bias and applicability concerns regarding participant selection. In detecting AAD, summary test accuracy estimates for all cut-offs were obtained from the SROC curves, with an AUC of 0.78 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.82; 11 studies, 2042 participants) for STAI-S and 0.78 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.81; 8 studies, 1906 participants) for STAI-T. At the commonly used cut-offs of >/= 40 for STAI-S, the summary sensitivity was 0.83 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.88) and specificity was 0.55 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.65). Similarly, for STAI-T at the cut-off of >/= 44, the summary sensitivity was 0.81 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.86) and specificity was 0.60 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.74). The analysis of STAI's accuracy in detecting GAD was restricted by the small number of studies (STAI-S: four studies, 1182 participants; STAI-T: three studies, 988 participants). For STAI-S at the cut-off >/= 40, the summary sensitivity was 0.86 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.93) and the specificity was 0.53 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.69). The AUC was 0.80 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.86). For STAI-T at the cut-off >/= 44, sensitivity was 0.86 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.94) and specificity 0.57 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.75). The AUC was 0.81 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.82). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The currently available evidence does not allow a confident judgment on the STAI's accuracy in screening for anxiety disorders. Findings come from a limited number of studies, most at high or unclear risk of bias, and almost exclusively conducted in specialised clinical settings among individuals with a variety of underlying health conditions, thus limiting generalisability. Based on common interpretations of the AUC, the overall accuracy of the STAI-S and STAI-T subscales across all cut-offs is moderate and broadly comparable to other anxiety questionnaires. While proposed cut-offs (>/= 40 for STAI-S and >/= 44 for STAI-T) provide adequate sensitivity, specificity remains low, thus raising concerns about substantial misclassification, particularly in low-prevalence contexts. Its suitability for screening is further limited by its original purpose as a severity measure, its considerable length compared to alternative questionnaires, its two separate subscale scores without clear screening guidance, and the absence of evidence-based cut-off recommendations. Thus, the STAI currently does not appear to be the first-choice screening instrument, particularly given the availability of shorter, better-researched questionnaires that have been specifically developed for anxiety screening. However, given the limited evidence base and the lack of formal comparisons with other questionnaires, this conclusion remains preliminary.

    "abstract": "Autophagy-mediated targeted protein degradation, exemplified by technologies such as autophagosome-tethering compounds (ATTECs), AUTOphagy-TArgeting chimeras (AUTOTACs), and autophagy-targeting chimeras (AUTACs), leverages the autophagy-lysosome pathway for the clearance of challenging substrates that often exceed proteasomal capacity. These substrates include large protein aggregates, multi-protein complexes, and even entire organelles. This review synthesizes key advances in the development of autophagy-based degraders since 2022, highlighting their therapeutic potential through exemplar applications. We discuss their utility in oncology, neurodegenerative disorders, and inflammatory/cardiometabolic diseases. These novel modalities have demonstrated potent, selective, and durable substrate elimination in vivo, successfully overcoming resistance mechanisms associated with traditional occupancy-driven inhibition. Finally, we summarize the general workflow for developing autophagy-based degraders, outline the current challenges and future directions in this field, and aim to promote fundamental mechanistic studies and innovative medicinal chemistry research, thereby accelerating the clinical translation of autophagy-targeting degraders for the treatment of various human diseases."

    "abstract": "Nanometal-based therapies face challenges arising from the overexpression of proton efflux transporters in cancer cells, which acidifies the extracellular tumor microenvironment (TME) while preserving a relatively neutral intracellular pH, thereby compromising therapeutic efficacy and fostering an immunosuppressive TME. Here, we integrate the proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole (PTZ) with manganese ferrite nanoparticles (MFNs) within an acidity-responsive polymer for enhanced ferroptosis and cGAS-STING activation mediated immunotherapy. This assembly (PTZ/MFNAs) facilitates tumor accumulation through the enhanced permeability and retention effect while initially restricting the release of metal ions. Upon reaching the tumor site, PTZ release increases intracellular acidity, which further triggers assembly disintegration, accelerates the release of iron and manganese ions, and neutralizes the extracellular microenvironment to alleviate immunosuppression. The released manganese ions synergistically collaborate with iron ions to amplify reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation for ferroptosis while activating the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway, stimulating innate immunity. This potentiation of innate immunity, coupled with the reversal of TME immunosuppression, collectively and effectively inhibits tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore, the PTZ/MFNAs co-delivery system represents a promising pH-modulation strategy to enhance iron/manganese ions-mediated ferroptosis and cGAS-STING activation-induced immunotherapy."

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer screening is a life-saving endeavour. The introduction of an organized population-based national screening programmes has potential to both reduce incidence of cervical cancer in an asymptomatic population and detect early-stage cancers for accelerated treatment. A methodology for estimating cancers prevented by such programmes has immediate utility. This work derives a model for estimating cancer prevented by screening, applied to data from Ireland's organized national cervical screening programme since its introduction in August 2008 to August 2022. A novel Markov-chain model for human papilloma virus (HPV) induced cervical cancer was derived with realistic transition probabilities validated against literature estimates. Data from the Irish National Screening Programme (CervicalCheck) and from the National Cancer Registry of Ireland (NCRI) was applied to estimate the number of cancers prevented by screening, changes in Irish cancer detection since the implementation of screening, and treatment costs saved by screening. Since its inception in 2008, the modelling in this work suggests that CervicalCheck has prevented an estimated 5557 cancers (95% confidence interval: 5114-6000 cancers) and saved euro102 million in future treatment costs (95% confidence interval: euro94-110 million) not including inflation costs. Additionally, 48.8% (95% confidence interval: 41.4%-56.2%) of all cervical cancers in Ireland have been detected through screening between 2008 and 2022. National screening in Ireland has been highly effective at reducing future cervical cancers, and detecting asymptomatic cancers. The model outlined here has direct future applicability for the assessment of national and regional cervical cancer screening programmes."

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the predominant type of primary liver cancer, with high morbidity and mortality rates globally, ranking it among the leading causes of cancer‑related death worldwide. Despite notable advancements in HCC treatment in recent years, high rates of recurrence and treatment resistance remain significant clinical challenges. The development of drug resistance undermines the efficacy of current therapies and leads to poor patient outcomes. However, the specific role and detailed delivery mechanism of exosomal circular RNAs (circRNAs) in mediating this treatment resistance are still largely undefined. circRNAs represent a group of non‑coding RNAs with various biological roles. An increasing number of circRNAs are abnormally expressed in HCC and participate in the malignant progression of HCC, playing a role in HCC treatment resistance. Furthermore, circRNAs can exert additional effects when packaged into exosomes. Exosomes, as signaling molecules of intercellular communication, are enriched with circRNAs, which can be packaged, secreted and transferred to target recipient tumor cells, thereby regulating the development process and drug resistance of cancer. The present comprehensive review aims to summarize how these exosomal circRNAs regulate key hallmarks of cancer in HCC and critically synthesize the current literature, elucidating how exosomal circRNAs modulate therapeutic resistance in HCC and highlighting their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets."

    "abstract": "Pain serves as both a protective physiological response essential for species survival and a global health issue affecting human well‑being and societal development. The present review systematically summarized and analyzed the research progresses on pain through a multidimensional analytical framework encompassing animal models, molecular targets, therapeutic approaches and future prospects. In animal modeling, neuropathic pain paradigms have evolved from traditional mechanical compression to composite models that combine dynamic displacement and chemical stimulation. Cancer‑induced pain models employ orthotopic tumor transplantation to recapitulate bone metastasis and soft tissue invasion mechanisms and visceral pain models combine inflammatory mediators with mechanical distension to replicate clinical manifestations. The above animal models are the main models of pain, each with its own characteristics and applicable scope. The studies of molecular targets have identified voltage‑gated ion channel, G protein‑coupled receptor signaling cascades, and inflammation‑related enzymes as critical analgesic targets, providing a molecular basis for the design of new analgesic drugs. New targets for treating pain are still being studied. Clinical treatment strategies are showing a trend of multimodal integration, with breakthroughs in opioid optimization and non‑opioid innovation in drug therapy, precise analgesia achieved through neuromodulation techniques in intervention therapy, and strengthened chronic pain management dimensions through physical and psychological interventions. Although there are a number of means for treating pain, the research on drugs that can truly cure pain has still a long way to go. The future research and development of analgesics will focus on in‑depth analysis of pathological mechanisms, adverse reactions of opioid drugs, personalized analgesic strategies, and interdisciplinary transformation."

The PAK1 protein complexed with dibenzodiazepine was fetched from the PDB with the identifier 4ZLO. The structure was preprocessed through preparation and exposed to pharmacophore hypotheses on the Schrodinger suite programme, indicating key features of RRH. A multi-tiered docking-based screening workflow from the libraries of ZINC and Enamine databases identified five potential bioactive compounds: ZINC952869440, ZINC952869442, ENAMINE558, ENAMINE6304, and ENAMINE8429. The docking and MM/GBSA scores ranked from -5.02 to -8.34 kcal/mol and -46.10 to -50.41 kcal/mol. Remarkably, none of these candidates violated the rules of five, and the Qikprop parameters complied with pharmacokinetic suitability. The DFT analysis revealed energy gap scores ranged from -0.182 to -0.225 eV, indicating favourable electronic properties and stability of the ligands. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) and essential dynamics (ED) studies validated the structural stability of the complexes. The secondary structure analysis indicated stable retention of alpha-helices and beta-strands throughout the simulation.

    "abstract": "Krebs von den Lungen‑6 (KL‑6), a high‑molecular‑weight glycoprotein, is frequently elevated in patients with cancer; however, its precise role in the clinical progression of breast cancer (BC) remains unclear. Tumor hypoxia has been recognized as a critical driver of cancer progression. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of hypoxia on KL‑6 expression and its contribution to the invasive behavior of BC cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of KL‑6 and hypoxia‑inducible factor‑1alpha (HIF‑1alpha) was performed in 30 clinical BC tissue samples, and their expression levels were correlated with patient outcomes. BC cell lines (MCF‑7 and MDA‑MB‑231) were used for in vitro analyses, including immunofluorescence, western blotting, wound healing assays, and three‑dimensional spheroid cultures under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, as well as chemically induced hypoxia using cobalt chloride (CoCl(2)). The subcellular localization of KL‑6 was further examined through immunoelectron microscopy. In clinical specimens, high KL‑6 expression was significantly associated with increased recurrence or metastasis, as was elevated HIF‑1alpha expression. Although MCF‑7 cells exhibited higher basal KL‑6 expression, marked upregulation was observed in MDA‑MB‑231 cells under hypoxic spheroid conditions, where KL‑6 co‑localized with HIF‑1alpha, particularly within invasive cellular protrusions. Functional inhibition of KL‑6 suppressed the migration of MCF‑7 cells. Treatment with CoCl(2) significantly induced KL‑6 and HIF‑1alpha expression in MCF‑7 cells. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed the localization of KL‑6 on cell membranes and within protrusive structures. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that hypoxia enhances KL‑6 expression in BC cells, partly mediated by HIF‑1alpha, and that KL‑6 contributes to tumor cell invasion."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common skin cancer worldwide, accounting for approximately 80% of all skin cancers. Although more prevalent among Caucasians, BCC affects individuals of all racial and ethnic groups and may present atypically in skin of color, contributing to delayed diagnosis. AIMS: This review aims to examine the causes, clinical presentations, prevention strategies, and treatment options for BCC, with an emphasis on recent advancements and ongoing challenges in management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review integrates current peer-reviewed literature with clinical insights derived from dermatologic practice, including the evaluation of representative, deidentified patient cases. Observations from clinical experience were incorporated to contextualize diagnostic approaches, management strategies, and treatment outcomes across diverse patient populations. All patient information was anonymized, and no identifiable data were included. RESULTS: Ultraviolet (UV) radiation remains the leading cause of BCC in fair-skinned populations, whereas genetic predispositions and environmental factors play a larger role in darker-skinned individuals. Diagnostic advances, including dermoscopy and reflectance confocal microscopy, have improved detection, particularly for pigmented lesions that may mimic benign conditions. Preventative strategies include broad-spectrum physical sunscreens, protective clothing, lifestyle modifications, and supplementation such as nicotinamide, which has demonstrated potential in reducing UV-induced skin damage. Treatment options range from Mohs micrographic surgery, considered the gold standard for high-risk and cosmetically sensitive areas, to simple excision, electrodessication and curettage, radiation therapy, and advanced systemic therapies including sonic hedgehog and PD-1 inhibitors for locally advanced or metastatic disease. DISCUSSION: Emerging diagnostic tools and expanding therapeutic modalities have enhanced the ability to tailor BCC management to individual patient risk profiles and tumor characteristics. Non-surgical and combination approaches continue to evolve, offering effective alternatives for select cases. CONCLUSION: By integrating prevention, early diagnosis, and personalized treatment strategies, modern approaches to BCC management are improving patient outcomes and addressing the complexities of care across diverse populations, underscoring the importance of multidisciplinary and individualized management."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent literature indicates a decline in rates of candidemia in the general population. OBJECTIVES: To analyse temporal trends in candidemia among patients with solid tumours and haematological malignancies admitted to a dedicated cancer centre. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all episodes of candidemia from July 2008 to June 2020 (12-year period). The incidence of candidemia was estimated as the number of new cases per 1000 patient days of hospital admission quarterly. A linear regression model was used to analyse changes in incidence rates. RESULTS: Over a 12-year period a total of 212 episodes of candidemia were identified with 90 (42.5%) occurring in patients with haematological malignancies and 122 (57.5%) in patients with solid tumours. The overall incidence of candidemia was 0.49 episodes per 1000 patient-days of admission per quarter. There was a significant decline in the incidence of candidemia overtime for the overall cohort (from 0.81 to 0.21 patient days per quarter, p < 0.001). This decline was statistically significant in patients with solid tumours (from 0.91 to 0.18 patient days per quarter, p < 0.001) with only a downward trend noted in patients with haematological malignancies (from 0.65 to 0.25 patient days per quarter, p = 0.052). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a global decline in episodes of candidemia in patients with malignancies mainly driven by a decrease in patients with solid tumours. Patients with haematological malignancies continue to experience considerable rates of candidemia."

METHODS: A total of 85 women at Tri-Service General Hospital (TSGH) were included to directly compare the performance of physician-collected swabs and self-collected tampons. An additional cohort of 39 self-collected tampons from patients at Shuang Ho Hospital (SHH) was included for further validation. The effects of age, body mass index (BMI), and BHLHE22 and CDO1 methylation levels on MPap test performance were analyzed across samples from patients with and without EC. The performance of the MPap test is presented as percentage of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy (ACC). The Pearson's correlation test was used to examine the association between swab and tampon in the MPap test. RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) of MPap to detect EC in 85 swabs and tampons both were 0.94 (0.88-1.00). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and ACC of the two collection methods did not show significant differences. The testing results using a tampon were highly correlated with the results using a physician-collected swab (R(2) = 0.6810, P < 0.001). Furthermore, the AUC of MPap to detect EC in 39 tampons was 0.97 (0.93-1.02). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and ACC were 90.48%, 94.44%, 95.00%, 89.47%, and 92.31%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our data inferred the potential of the MPap test in early detection of EC using vaginal secretion collected by an intravaginal self-collected tampon."

    "abstract": "Cell division cycle 20 homologue (Cdc20), a key regulator of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), is frequently overexpressed in human cancers and represents a promising therapeutic target. However, monotherapy targeting Cdc20 has shown limited efficacy, partly due to compensatory activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1). In this study, we investigated the combinatorial potential of the pan-Cdk inhibitor ZK304709 with the Cdc20 inhibitor apcin in HeLa cervical cancer cells. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that both CDC20 and CDK1 are upregulated in cervical cancer tissues. Mechanistically, apcin treatment induced cyclin B1 accumulation and enhanced Cdk1 phosphorylation at Thr161, suggesting feedback activation. In contrast, ZK304709 reduced p-Cdk1(T161) levels and suppressed Cdc20 expression at both protein and mRNA levels. Functionally, the combination of apcin and ZK304709 synergistically inhibited cell proliferation and induced G2/M phase arrest in HeLa cells. These findings demonstrate that dual inhibition of Cdk1 and Cdc20 disrupts compensatory signalling pathways and enhances antitumour efficacy in HeLa cells, providing a rational strategy for combination therapy in cervical cancer."

    "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is among the ten most common cancers worldwide and is associated with high morbidity and poor survival. Diminished HNSCC outcomes are often related to delayed diagnosis and treatment of occult progression of premalignant lesions, underscoring the need for effective and low risk chemoprevention strategies. In this regard, metformin has shown promising clinical activity for HNSCC prevention. Here, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen of metformin-treated HNSCC cells and identified activation of PKA signaling as the top resistance pathway. We show that metformin mediates PKA activation in HNSCC cells, and that PKA inhibition (PKAi) when combined with metformin treatment synergistically inhibits HNSCC growth. We found that metformin-induced PKA activation is mediated by a prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) autocrine loop, which can be blocked using cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) inhibitors. Importantly, COX2 inhibition using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) combined with metformin treatment synergistically inhibits HNSCC cell growth and prevents progression of oral premalignant lesions (OPLs) into invasive HNSCC in a model of tobacco-driven oral carcinogenesis. Together, these findings demonstrate that metformin and NSAID combination therapy may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for HNSCC chemoprevention."

    "abstract": "Paraspeckles are stress-induced nuclear RNA-protein condensates that assemble on the long non-coding RNA NEAT1. Their increased formation under certain cellular circumstances has gained growing interest due to their association with serious human diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. The biological functions of paraspeckles still appear obscure, but increasing evidence suggests that they contribute to regulation of gene expression by recruiting specific proteins and RNA molecules. Here, we have characterized and compared two stress-enriched interactomes of the essential paraspeckle protein NONO in both wild type and paraspeckle-deficient NEAT1 knockout cells. We identified Hsp70 as part of stress-enriched NONO complexes in wild type, but not in NEAT1-depleted cells. We show that proteotoxic stress-induced paraspeckle formation and NEAT1 expression are strictly dependent on Hsp70 chaperone activity. Our data demonstrate that both NONO and Hsp70 transiently translocate to the nucleolus during heat shock and that paraspeckle formation during recovery follows Hsp70-dependent relocation of NONO from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. Taken together, we demonstrate an important role of Hsp70 in paraspeckle assembly and identify a possible link between the nuclear protein quality control system and paraspeckles."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In February 2024, a sudden government policy to drastically increase medical school admissions triggered the mass resignations of medical trainees across South Korea, severely disrupting hospital operations. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the resulting healthcare workforce disruptions on short-term clinical outcomes and the timing of colorectal cancer surgeries. METHODS: This retrospective comparative study analyzed patients with colorectal cancer treated at two national university hospitals in Daegu and Gwangju, South Korea. Patients who first visited the colorectal surgery department between March and August of 2023 and 2024 were included. Data from 2020 to 2022 were used for extended comparisons. The primary outcome was the interval from initial outpatient visit to surgery. Secondary outcomes included treatment modality distribution, tumor staging, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: A total of 895 patients in 2023 and 853 in 2024 were included. In 2024, only 39.5% of patients (337/853) underwent upfront surgery compared to 63.5% (569/895) in 2023. The median time to surgery increased from 30 days (interquartile range [IQR], 22-44 days) to 52 days (IQR, 30-72 days) (p=0.001). Clinical T3-4 tumors increased from 49.9% to 59.3% (p=0.018), lymph node-positive cases increased from 25.9% to 51.3% (p=0.001), and postoperative complication rates increased from 12.0% to 28.2% (p=0.001). CONCLUSION: The abrupt healthcare workforce crisis in early 2024 significantly delayed colorectal cancer surgeries and was associated with worse short-term oncologic outcomes. These findings highlight the critical importance of maintaining a stable healthcare workforce to protect access to timely cancer care."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are a group of drugs used to cease the production of estrogens that have been used to treat mainly postmenopausal women with both early and advanced estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer for more than 40 years. They are the first-line therapy for hormone-dependent cancers either alone or in combination with other therapies. This review aims to demonstrate the relevance of research on steroidal AIs. AREAS COVERED: This work focuses on steroidal AIs and aims to provide a comprehensive explanation of the most potent ones (IC(50) < 10 microM), the respective structure-activity relationships (SAR), and the particular biological mechanisms of action, published during the last 20 years, from 2005 until June 2025. The literature search was made on the web of science database, using the topic 'steroidal aromatase inhibitors.' EXPERT OPINION: Potent hit steroidal AIs have been discovered. However, further studies are needed, including tests on more complex models, namely using 3D cell lines and organoids as well as animal studies, with the aim of progressing on the drug discovery process, ultimately to discover new potent steroidal AIs with less side effects, especially those related to bone and cardiovascular health and capable to overcome endocrine resistance."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing incidence of cancer worldwide, the knowledge about the trend of cancer incidence in Ethiopia is limited. The paucity of core cancer diagnostic services like pathology, diagnostic imaging technology, and the absence of a comprehensive national cancer registry masked the exact magnitude of cancer incidence in Ethiopia in general and the Wolaita area in particular. This study is aimed at filling the gap by analyzing diagnostic data from a referral clinic. The clinic used to serve as a primary diagnostic center for patients referred from over 25 healthcare facilities in the region. METHODS: A pathology sample retrospective analysis-based prevalence study was conducted for the period between December 2017 and February 2022. Records saved in computers were subjected to analysis by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software Version 22. The data were used to analyze the types and distribution of cancers in the region across age, sex, and diagnosis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS: The results showed notable gender disparities, with women experiencing a greater prevalence of breast cancer and men mostly receiving diagnoses for soft tissue sarcomas. The most prevalent forms of cancer were determined, along with the locations of each. The study also emphasized how different referral facilities, such as general hospitals, primary hospitals, and medium-sized clinics, had varying cancer incidence rates. Although generalizability may be limited by the study's clinic-based design, its relevance to comparable healthcare settings in Ethiopia and other low-resource locations is strengthened by the large and diverse sample drawn from a variety of referral institutions. This study emphasizes the necessity of focused screening programs and greater cancer awareness in Wolaita Zone, particularly in rural regions. The results also suggest possible directions for future investigation, such as population-based studies to confirm and build upon these findings. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides crucial insights into the cancer burden in Wolaita Zone and emphasizes the importance of improving diagnostic and preventive measures. Further research, including broader, population-based studies, is necessary to confirm these findings and inform regional cancer control strategies."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) affects up to 20% of cancer patients, causing dyspnea and frequent hospitalizations. Treatment includes thoracentesis, pleurodesis, and indwelling pleural catheters (IPC). While UK pleural clinics enhance outpatient care, Denmark lacks a national strategy. This study aims to map the use of IPCs in a Nordic country, focusing on referral, placement, follow-up, and reimbursement of expenses to drainage supplies. METHODS: A national questionnaire survey was conducted from January to July 2022. The questionnaire, developed by the Danish Respiratory Society's pleural diseases group, covered IPC placement, management, follow-up, and financial aspects. It was distributed to all departments placing IPCs, identified via suppliers and expert input. Data on the number of IPCs delivered to each department in 2022 were obtained from Danish IPC retailers. RESULTS: Of the 23 identified departments, 20 completed the survey. IPCs were available in all five Danish healthcare regions, but heterogeneity was observed in prevalence, reimbursement methods, procedural organization, and follow-up strategies. IPC use was more prevalent in respiratory medical departments and in the North and Central Regions. No standardized national reimbursement policy was identified. CONCLUSION: This survey reveals regional disparities in IPC use and reimbursement in Denmark within the same public healthcare system. The lack of national guidelines and centralized funding mechanisms may contribute to these variations. The introduction of dedicated pleural clinics and standardized reimbursement policies could help ensure equitable and guideline-based MPE management across regions."

    "abstract": "Background Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with significant variation in clinical behaviour, pathological morphology and molecular patterns. While most of the breast cancer cases follow common histological and clinical patterns, but a few rare subtypes behave differently with a difference in prognosis and response to therapy. Recognizing these subtypes of breast cancer is important for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Aims and objectives This study aimed to evaluate the clinical features, pathological criteria, and outcomes of patients with these rare breast cancer subtypes treated at King Fahad Specialist Hospital (KFSH-D), a biggest regional tertiary care center.  Patients and methods This is a retrospective, observational, descriptive study analyzing 30 patients diagnosed with rare breast cancer subtypes and treated at KFSH-D between January 2019 and December 2024. Results We included 30 patients with rare pathological breast cancer subtypes. Among them, eight patients (27%) had apocrine carcinoma. The mean age at diagnosis for this group was between 55 and 60 years and a mean tumor size was greater than 2 cm. Additionally, 14 (46%) patients had metaplastic carcinoma, with a mean age at diagnosis of 45-60 years and tumor sizes ranging between 3 and 5 cm. Five (17%) patients were diagnosed with mucinous adenocarcinoma. Their mean age at diagnosis was 70 years, with tumors larger than 2 cm. All of these patients had stage N0-N1 disease and were positive for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and negative for Her-2/neu on immunohistochemistry (IHC). One (3%) patient had lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma. She was diagnosed at 51 years of age, with a tumor size of 2.2x3.2 cm. She underwent simple mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The tumor was histologic grade III with no lymphovascular invasion or intraductal component. We also identified two (7%) patients with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) showing neuroendocrine differentiation. Both were positive for chromogranin A and synaptophysin on IHC. Their ages at diagnosis were 55-65 years, and tumor sizes ranged from 4 to 6 cm. These tumors were histologic grade III, hormone receptor-positive, and Her-2/neu negative. Survival outcomes varied across groups, with mucinous carcinoma showing the most favorable prognosis. Conclusion Rare subtypes of invasive breast cancers have distinct clinical and pathological behaviours with different outcomes. Recognition of these tumors will help in patient-tailored treatment strategies and will contribute to better patient management."

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer metastasising to the urethra is a very rare occurrence of advanced disease. Herein, we present a case of a 64-year-old male patient presenting with urethral metastasis of prostate adenocarcinoma. This patient initially presented in May 2024 with visible haematuria, with flexible cystoscopy in July 2024 revealing a polypoid lesion in the anterior urethra measuring 1.5 cm and a second villous growth in the prostatic fossa. The patient's initial prostate adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in 2017, managed with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), radical radiotherapy, and adjuvant hormonal therapy up until 2019, with stable disease and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) until 2024. Initial management was resection of both lesions with subsequent repeat cystoscopy for further clearance of the anterior urethral lesion. Histopathological analysis of both lesions revealed the lesion in the prostatic fossa to be a nephrogenic metaplasia and the anterior urethral lesion to be prostatic adenocarcinoma (Gleason 4+4). After a multidisciplinary team discussion, the patient was deemed for further hormonal treatment to manage this new metastatic deposit. Continued oncological review and management are still underway. Occult metastasis of prostate cancer in this manner is extremely rare in the literature and requires early detection and clinical vigilance for timely treatment."

    "abstract": "Bladder cancer commonly presents with haematuria, but its clinical features can vary, and unusual presentations may delay diagnosis. Papillary urothelial carcinoma (PUC) is a frequent subtype, typically arising from the bladder urothelium. While most cases are detected through standard urological symptoms and imaging, the presence of extensive urethral and bladder calculi can obscure the underlying pathology. We describe a 45-year-old man with a history of recurrent urinary stone passage who presented with haematuria following expulsion of a large urethral calculus. Examination revealed palpable stones along the urethra, and imaging demonstrated multiple sizeable, calcified lesions within the bladder and urethra. Cystoscopy confirmed complete obstruction of the penile and bulbar urethra by stones, which were removed cystoscopically. A large calcified intravesical mass was subsequently excised. Histopathological analysis identified high-grade PUC with invasion of the muscularis propria. The patient received intravesical mitomycin C one day after resection, prior to histology results, which showed muscularis propria involvement. The patient underwent further staging with pelvic MRI, which showed no evidence of advanced or metastatic disease, and a computed tomography urogram to visualise the upper tract, which showed no further stones or masses in the kidneys, ureters or collecting system and complete resection of bladder mass. At follow-up, he remained clinically stable with no signs of recurrence or evidence of metastasis. This case highlights an uncommon presentation of muscle-invasive PUC concealed by extensive calculi. It emphasises the importance of maintaining diagnostic vigilance in patients with persistent or atypical urolithiasis and demonstrates the value of early histopathological evaluation and timely postoperative intravesical therapy."

    "abstract": "The sole treatment for pancreatic cancer, which is a hazardous condition, is surgery, which has a high postoperative morbidity rate. Traditional perioperative care often makes the healing process more difficult and increases the risk of problems. The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols that were created to address colorectal operations are intended to alleviate surgical trauma and promote recovery based on evidence-based, multimodal interventions. The current review will focus on the ongoing problem of the high rate of pancreatic resection morbidity and consider the effectiveness and applicability of ERAS in the same context. The aim is to critically evaluate clinical outcomes and barriers to implementation by performing a narrative synthesis of trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses. The important results imply that the use of ERAS protocols minimizes complications, decreases the length of hospital stays, and enhances recovery without mortality or readmission. Key challenges are the emphasis on protocol compliance, institutional issues, and limited representation of high-risk groups, namely, the elderly and infirm. The review concludes that, although ERAS has apparent advantages, its success is based on readiness, a robust multidisciplinary approach involving surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, dietitians, physiotherapists, and pain specialists to ensure coordinated care, and high protocol fidelity of the institution. The implications are that ERAS guidelines will have to be standardized, digital adherence tools will also be necessary, and multicenter trials will need to be inclusive of diverse patient populations. The review offers an elaborate model that can be used to achieve improved, fairer, and patient-centered perioperative care in pancreatic oncology."

    "abstract": "The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models and image-generation tools, is poised to transform the field of urology. These technologies enable innovative applications in medical education, clinical decision support, patient communication, and surgical planning, extending beyond traditional analytical AI by creating new content, from synthetic clinical notes to simulated surgical environments. In urology, these capabilities translate into automated summarization of complex patient histories, generation of patient-specific three-dimensional anatomical reconstructions, and support for differential diagnosis in conditions such as prostate cancer or renal masses. However, the rapid adoption of generative AI also introduces significant ethical, legal, and clinical challenges. Risks are amplified in urological practice, where sensitive imaging data, biomarker profiles, and diagnostic decision pathways may be vulnerable to privacy breaches, algorithmic bias, or erroneous AI-generated recommendations. Hallucinated outputs, such as incorrect treatment summaries or misinterpreted radiologic features, can directly compromise patient safety if not rigorously validated. This review synthesizes the current landscape of generative AI in urology, critically examines these discipline-specific risks, and proposes a structured framework for responsible integration into clinical workflows. We highlight the need for transparent governance, bias mitigation, prospective validation, and interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure that generative AI enhances, rather than undermines, the quality, equity, and safety of urologic care."

    "abstract": "Tumor-to-tumor metastasis is a rare oncologic phenomenon in which one primary malignancy metastasizes into another distinct neoplasm. While meningiomas are the most common recipients, this route of recurrence has not been reported in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated lung adenocarcinoma. A 74-year-old female patient, who had remained disease-free for 14 years after undergoing right upper lobectomy for stage IA (pT1N0M0) lung adenocarcinoma, presented with headache and vomiting. Brain MRI demonstrated a 30 x 35 mm mass in the left parietal lobe with both solid and cystic portions abutting the dura and associated with surrounding edema, which was subsequently resected. Histopathological examination showed an admixture of meningioma and adenocarcinoma components, consistent with tumor-to-tumor metastasis. Immunohistochemistry revealed adenocarcinoma cells positive for thyroid transcription factor-1, Napsin A, and cytokeratin 7, supporting a pulmonary origin. Molecular testing identified an EGFR exon 19 deletion in both the intracranial lesion and the primary lung adenocarcinoma resected 14 years earlier, confirming a shared clonal origin. Following diagnosis, the patient received postoperative radiation therapy followed by osimertinib, and she remains recurrence-free three years after surgery. This case highlights an exceptionally rare pattern of recurrence, tumor-to-tumor metastasis of EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma after right upper lobectomy into a meningioma, occurring 14 years after curative surgery. Oncologists should recognize that EGFR-mutated lung cancer can recur after an exceptionally long disease-free interval through rare metastatic patterns such as tumor-to-tumor metastasis."

    "abstract": "Chromosome instability (CIN) remains among the most important problems in modern cancer research. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify genes that contribute to CIN. To achieve this, we used a human artificial chromosome in a novel sensitized screen to measure CIN. We screened 18,658 genes for their roles in maintaining chromosomal stability and identified 834 candidates as potential CIN genes. A secondary RNAi screen identified 44 genes with the most pronounced CIN phenotypes. In guilt-by-association analysis using a published set of 8,498 proteins across a panel of 949 cancer cell lines, this cohort of 44 genes displayed a striking correlation with mitotic regulators. Furthermore, altered expression of these proteins was associated with a poor prognosis across multiple cancer types. Specifically, downregulation of AMY2B, ALAD, PDGFRA, PPIE, VEZ1, and TTC19 is associated with poor survival in two or more of the following: small cell lung cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer. The genes identified in this screen hold potential as prognostic markers for patient survival across several cancer types and could potentially serve as targets for the development of new therapeutic approaches aimed at mitigating CIN."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Globally, cervical cancer can be cured if diagnosed at an early stage and treated promptly. However, this is rarely done in low- and middle-income countries, where the highest rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are reported. In Uganda, less than 20% of the targeted population utilize cervical cancer screening services despite these being readily available in health facilities across the country at no cost. We aimed to determine the factors associated with utilization of cervical cancer screening services among women of reproductive age at Mbale regional referral hospital in eastern Uganda. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving 355 participants, we recruited clients attending the family planning clinic at Mbale regional referral hospital. We conducted multivariable logistic regression to determine the factors associated with utilization of cervical cancer screening services. Data were analyzed in Stata version 14.1. RESULTS: Only 33/355 (9.3 %) women had ever utilized cervical cancer screening services. Majority of the women 23/33(69.7 %) who had ever screened for cervical cancer, did so after recommendation by a health worker. Utilization of cervical cancer screening services was associated with: maternal age of 30 years and above [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 11.25 Confidence Interval (CI) (3.67-34.55)] and being more knowledgeable about cervical cancer [AOR 5.13 95 % CI (1.75-15.08)]. CONCLUSION: Adequate knowledge about cervical cancer and level of utilization of cervical cancer screening services was low among women at a regional referral hospital in Eastern Uganda. We recommend the following interventions targeted at increasing access to services and health literacy levels in the community. 1. Integrating cervical cancer screening into existing community outreach programs such as immunization. 2. Use of mass media and text messages in local dialects to communicate information about cervical cancer. 3. Community led campaigns and outreaches aimed at educating the public about risk factors and available methods of prevention of cervical cancer. 4. Health workers are also encouraged to routinely recommend and encourage cervical cancer screening services to all women of reproductive age that are under their care."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and safety of a domestically developed, single-arm single-port robotic system for performing complex gynecological surgeries under extreme conditions, such as ultra-remote locations and high-altitude environments. METHODS: In November and December 2024, a surgeon on the campus of West China Second Hospital, Sichuan University in Chengdu remotely manipulated a domestically developed single-arm, single-port robotic surgical system via a high-speed, low-latency communication network to perform two telesurgical procedures. The first procedure was a transumbilical single-port robot-assisted laparoscopic total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and left ovarian cystectomy on a patient with multiple uterine fibroids at the Maternity and Child Health Hospital of Xizang Autonomous Region (distance between Chengdu and Lhasa > 2000 km and altitude difference >3000 m). The second procedure was a transumbilical single-port robot-assisted laparoscopic total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and sentinel lymph node biopsy on a patient with FIGO stage IA endometrial cancer at Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University in Guangzhou (the distance between Chengdu and Guangzhou > 1500 km). Perioperative data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Both procedures were successfully completed without conversion to laparotomy or the use of additional auxiliary ports. The operative times for the Chengdu-Lhasa and Chengdu-Guangzhou surgeries were 90 minutes and 135 minutes, respectively, with estimated blood loss </= 50 mL in both cases. The intraoperative bidirectional network latency remained around 40 ms, and the total end-to-end latency was less than 60 ms. The surgeon reported no perceptible delay in instrumental response. Both patients recovered well postoperatively, and no surgery-related complications or disease recurrence were observed during follow-up until July 2025. CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence supporting the feasibility and safety of a domestically developed single-arm, single-port robotic system for performing complex gynecological surgeries in ultra-remote and high-altitude settings. This technical approach offers a promising solution to address geographic disparities in access to high-quality medical resources and demonstrates significant potential for improving the availability of advanced minimally invasive surgery in remote areas and regions of special settings."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular targets and signaling pathways involved in the therapeutic effects of Lishukang Capsule (LSK) in a rat model of high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) using a proteomics-based approach. METHODS: A total of 60 male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to a control group, a HAPE model group, 3 LSK treatment groups receiving low-, medium-, and high-dose LSK, respectively, and a Rhodiola rosea (also known as Hongjitian [HJT] in pinyin, a Chinese Romanization system) control group. After HAPE modeling, the pharmacodynamic effects were assessed and the optimal LSK dose was determined using HE stains, inflammatory cytokine quantification, lung tissue water content, and the protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage. Label free quantitative proteomic profiling was then applied to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the optimal dose group, using a screening threshold of over 1.5-fold change and P < 0.05. The selected DEPs were validated with Western blotting, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. RESULTS: The medium-dose LSK group exhibited significant anti-HAPE effects. Findings from the proteomic analysis revealed, in the comparison with the control group, 267 DEPs were identified in the HAPE group. In the comparison with the HAPE group, 225 DEPs were identified in the medium-dose LSK group. A total of 112 DEPs in the control group were normalized following LSK treatment in the medium-dose LSK group. In addition, GO enrichment analysis of proteins differentially expressed between the HAPE and LSK group showed that these DEPs were mainly enriched in 12 biological processes, 2 cellular components, and 5 molecular functions. KEGG pathway analysis showed that LSK activated pathways associated with cell adhesion molecules, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, DNA replication/nucleotide excision repair, transcriptional dysregulation in cancer, and Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection, while inhibiting pathways associated with glycerophospholipid metabolism. Some differentially expressed proteins with potential functions were verified by Western blotting, including AGPAT5, NCAM1, SRSF3, and PLA2. These differentially expressed proteins were significantly expressed in the normal group, HAPE group, and LSK group, and the validation results were consistent with proteomic findings, indicating the high reliability of the proteomic results. CONCLUSION: LSK exerts a significant protective effect against HAPE. Proteomic analysis suggests that its therapeutic action may be mediated through activating pathways involved in cell adhesion molecules, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, DNA replication/nucleotide excision repair, transcriptional dysregulation in cancer, and HSV-1 infection, alongside inhibition of pathways associated with glycerophospholipid metabolism. The key DEPs identified in these pathways may play crucial roles in the preventive and therapeutic effects of LSK on HAPE."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many studies have found that exosomes have numerous advantages in the early diagnosis of tumors. We detected and analyzed plasma exosomes from lung cancer patients to identify potential biomarkers that could predict brain metastasis. METHOD: The total RNA of plasma exosomes of advanced lung cancer patients was extracted and sequenced. The BLAST software was used to align the predicted target gene sequence against the GO and KEGG databases, thereby acquiring annotation details for the target genes. The selected exosomal miRNAs and short-chain fatty acids were subjected to diagnostic performance validation analysis. RESULTS: Exosomal miR-223-3p, miR-27a-3p, and miR-27b-3p were significantly increased in the plasma exosomes of lung cancer patients with brain metastasis. The concentrations of isobutyric acid (IBA), valeric acid (VA), isovaleric acid (IVA), and acetic acid (AA) were markedly elevated in the plasma exosomes of lung cancer patients with brain metastasis. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that both miR-27a-3p and miR-27b-3p had significant associations with IVA and VA. A multi-biomarker model combining the selected exosomal miRNAs with metabolic molecules could improve the diagnostic performance with an AUC of 0.927. CONCLUSION: Plasma exosomal miR-223-3p, miR-27a-3p, miR-27b-3p, and IBA, IVA, VA, and AA in advanced patients are closely associated with brain metastasis and have the potential to act as biomarkers for predicting brain metastasis in lung cancer patients."

We present a patient who developed ALT/AST elevations after each subcutaneous injection, followed by improvement after withdrawal and hepatoprotective therapy, with positive rechallenge upon re-exposure. By the EASL definition, the R-value was  approximately 6.0, indicating a hepatocellular pattern; Hy's law was not fulfilled. Causality assessed with the updated RUCAM (2016) yielded a total score of 11, corresponding to highly probable. Although the ALT peak did not exceed 5 x ULN, the consistent temporal association and positive rechallenge prompted discontinuation/adjustment of goserelin with close biochemical follow-up, achieving a favorable outcome. This case underscores the need for vigilant monitoring-particularly with higher doses or re-exposure-and highlights the utility of R-value typing, Hy's law, and the updated RUCAM in guiding management. Liver biopsy was not performed, representing a limitation."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Virtual Reality (VR) is an advanced technological system which, besides its use in entertainment and education, has been permanently introduced over the past quarter-century into physical and psychiatric rehabilitation as well as medicine. Its effectiveness has been demonstrated in pain management during medical and rehabilitation procedures in burn patients, alleviation of cancer pain, and reduction of labor pain. VR is increasingly used during routine medical procedures in children, such as blood sampling, intravenous cannulation, and vaccination, and holds promise for chronic pain management. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess pain during the treatment of hard-to-heal wounds of vascular origin using VR as an adjunct non-pharmacological pain therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational study was conducted in a chronic wound care clinic involving 100 patients. The mean age was 68.02 +/- 10.0 years. All participants had hard-to-heal wounds of vascular origin. The mean wound duration was 7.16 +/- 5.08 months, with an average wound area of 39.18 +/- 71.83 cm(2) (range 2 cm(2) to 625 cm(2)). Patients were randomly assigned to a group distracted with VR goggles and a control group receiving standard care without VR. Pain intensity was assessed using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at three time points, and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) before the procedure, during wound debridement, and 10 min after completion. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed in pain assessment before and during wound debridement (p < 0.05). In the VR group, higher pain scores were recorded before wound care compared to the control group. Ten minutes before wound debridement, the mean pain intensity in the VR group was 2.60 +/- 1.63, higher than 2.0 +/- 1.53 in the control group. During wound debridement, pain intensity was higher in the control group (4.94 +/- 1.53) compared to the VR group (4.32 +/- 2.17). Pain intensity 10 min after debridement was similar in both groups: control (2.24 +/- 1.41) and VR (2.36 +/- 1.71). These findings support the hypothesis that VR goggles reduce pain intensity. No statistically significant differences in NRS pain scores were found between patients with different wound types in either group (p > 0.05). Variables such as wound duration and wound size influenced pain levels 10 min before wound care. No association was found between sex and pain intensity (p > 0.005). CONCLUSION: Increased pain during procedures involving manipulation of damaged tissues and wound debridement is a common phenomenon. This study confirmed that the use of VR goggles reduces perceived pain levels. The assessment of pain experience and intensity varies depending on the assessment tools used; therefore, a combined quantitative and qualitative evaluation is recommended to accurately determine the usefulness of innovative tools in clinical practice."

    "abstract": "The diverse expression of antigenic subtypes on tumor cells can substantially influence the specific binding and tumor cytotoxicity of antibody-recruiting molecules (ARMs). Therefore, the development of multivalent ARMs with high selectivity and affinity for binding to different subtypes on tumor cells can be expected to improve clinical performance. In this study, multivalent ARMs incorporated with multivalent dinitrophenyl (DNP) haptens and an integrin-specific arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) macrocyclic peptide were synthesized using a chemoenzymatic approach. The molecules specifically recognized integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-positive tumor cells and exhibited robust antibody recruitment capacity and tumor-killing effects depending on the multivalent effects. Notably, the D3 molecule showed excellent anti-DNP antibody recruitment capacity in the alpha(v)beta(3)-positive tumor cells and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)-mediated tumor cytotoxicity. Given the variable expression of integrin receptor subtypes among individuals, the multivalent ARMs developed in this study that specifically target alpha(v)beta(3)-positive tumor cells to enhance cancer cytotoxicity represent a promising strategy for tumor immunotherapy."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Skin cancer is the most common cancer faced by adults in the United States. Melanoma, while a less common subtype of skin cancer compared to basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas, is associated with greater rates of metastases, mortality, and morbidity, and its rate of incidence is projected to increase. Primary care physicians (PCPs) can play an important role in skin cancer detection and in the decision to refer a patient to a dermatologist. Technologies such as the elastic scattering spectroscopy (ESS) device (DermaSensor, Inc.), a handheld, noninvasive assistive tool, may help in the evaluation of a skin growth and improve appropriate referral decision making. METHODS: A total of 50 malignant and 50 benign lesions were assessed by each of the 118 physicians (board-certified internal and family medicine physicians), yielding 5,900 malignant and benign lesion assessments without the device and 5,900 with the ESS device. Physicians were also surveyed regarding their confidence in their management decision. RESULTS: The study met the primary endpoint; the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of the PCPs aided with the device was 0.671 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.611-0.732) compared with the AUROC unaided by the device of 0.630 (95% CI: 0.582-0.678), a significant increase (p=0.036). When asked whether the device would provide value to their decision making, 91.5% of respondents either agreed or strongly agreed. CONCLUSION: The ESS device improved PCP accuracy in managing lesions suggestive of melanoma and increased their sensitivity for all skin cancers and melanoma. Participating internal medicine and family medicine physicians reported increased confidence in their assessments with the device. The ESS device can improve PCP decision making when managing lesions suggestive of melanoma."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to evaluate the feasibility, educational outcomes, and cost-savings of free dermatologic screenings at local farmers' markets and a church in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. METHODS: We piloted six free skin cancer screenings at farmers' markets and a church in Oklahoma. Exposed areas were examined by dermatology residents under supervision of a board-certified dermatologist. Suspicious lesions were referred. Pre- and postscreening surveys assessed knowledge, sunscreen use, and barriers to care. Demographics and ZIP codes were collected. Follow-up was conducted at 6 months. We estimated cost savings per screening using published visit costs and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) mileage rates. Statistical analysis included paired t-tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and chi-square tests (p<0.05). RESULTS: Among 411 adults, 40 participants (9.7%) had notable lesions, including 7 confirmed basal cell carcinomas and 23 actinic keratoses. Awareness of risk-reducing practices and lesion recognition increased significantly postcounseling (both p<0.0001). The most reported barrier to dermatology was lack of perceived need. Estimated cost savings per participant was $156.70, totaling $64,403.70 across all participants. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include reliance on self-reported survey data, incomplete follow-up among referred participants, and lack of histopathologic confirmation for all findings. CONCLUSION: This study shows the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of free skin screenings when paired with local farmers' markets, which often provide complimentary spaces for nonprofit organizations. These low-cost models may enhance earlier detection and awareness in communities with limited access."

Contemporary recommendations to guide IBD surgical intervention now favor a minimally invasive approach, if possible. We present surgical outcomes following the introduction of robotic minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for IBD in a tertiary center. Aim Robotic approaches to colorectal resections are now becoming routine for colorectal cancer surgery but use in IBD is still not currently mainstream. Here, we describe our initial experience with robotic IBD surgery and compare 30-day surgical outcomes to laparoscopic and open approaches. Methods A single tertiary referral center experience of all patients over 16 years of age undergoing surgery for IBD between 2020 and 2023 was analyzed. This retrospective review of all prospectively gathered surgical data utilized the hospital database and prospectively recorded ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) records detailing patient recovery and complications. For the statistical calculations, we used ANOVA for overall data and Tukey's HSD for comparing each cohort. Results A total of 140 cases were analyzed, showing mean procedure time in minutes across robotic, laparoscopic, and open approaches (p=0.997): colectomies (268, 282, 265), panproctocolectomies (380, 425, 382), proctectomies (315, 259, 228), and small bowel resections (161, 165, 202). There was zero mortality across all groups. For robotic, laparoscopic, and open approaches, the major complications (Clavien-Dindo classification 3+) rates were 5.4%, 8%, and 3.5% (p=0.686), respectively, and the readmission rates were 8.10%, 9.33%, and 21.42%, respectively. The mean post-operative stays in days (p=0.164) were as follows: colectomies (6.70, 8.45, 10.33), panproctocolectomy (8.40, 8.92, 10.29), completion proctectomy (6.00, 5.00, 8.20), and ileocecal/small bowel resection (6.42, 6.46, 6.80). The costs for patients undergoing robotic surgery were higher (p=0.11). Conclusion This early data demonstrate real-world experience of the introduction of robotic surgical techniques for colorectal resection. Robotic surgical outcomes demonstrate equivalence with the laparoscopic outcomes and are improved compared to open procedures in most metrics but are more expensive."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The colorectal cancer (CRC) screening adherence rate among the uninsured population in the United States (US) is lower than the overall rate across all US adults aged 45 to 75. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of community health worker (CHW) navigation services promoting CRC screening in a low-income, uninsured population. METHODS: Using internal cost and effectiveness data from the Texas A&M Cancer Screening, Training, Education, and Prevention (CSTEP) program, which included 3196 participants, along with published sources such as the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations, we estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for CRC screening with CHW navigation versus usual care. The analysis was conducted from a societal perspective using Excel-based modeling in hypothetical cohorts initiating screening at age 45. RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, a 10 percentage-point improvement in CRC screening attributable to the program increased LYG by 0.160 at an additional lifetime cost of $101, resulting in an ICER of $3098 per LYG. One-way and two-way sensitivity analyses were conducted, varying program costs, screening rate improvements, lifetime CRC costs, and life-years gained (LYG). CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the importance of CHW navigation services incorporating CRC screening promotion strategies tailored to uninsured populations to alleviate disparities in colorectal cancer screening and outcomes. Further research should consider the characteristics of uninsured populations, and the applicability of the program targeted for various types of underserved populations."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Foregut cancers are best treated by specialized, multidisciplinary care, often delivered, at least in part, at tertiary centers. Patient perspectives on the factors that enhance access to and adherence to cancer treatment remain underexplored. This qualitative study explores patient-reported facilitators of care at a safety-net hospital in the Southeastern United States (US). METHODS: Patients with foregut cancer receiving care at a safety-net tertiary care institution in the Southeastern US were recruited. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using NVivo 14 Software. Grounded theory methodology was used to identify themes and subthemes. A comprehensive codebook was established, with a high interrater reliability rate of > 90 % for all themes. RESULTS: Of the 30 patients interviewed, the majority were male (n = 23, 77 %) and Black (n = 18, 60 %), with an average age of 63 (IQR: 55-67). Facilitator themes were identified across four categories: (1) Individual/Interpersonal; (2) Provider/Care Team; (3) Healthcare Systems, and (4) Broader Policy. The most prevalent facilitators identified included faith and spirituality (87 %), support from immediate family (83 %), trust in the care team (90 %), and effective communication (97 %). CONCLUSION: Understanding patient perspectives is essential for delivering high-quality care in foregut cancer. These facilitators should be actively promoted during the development of future interventions. An appreciation of patient beliefs, communication training for care providers, hiring necessary ancillary staff, use of written handouts, expanding financial aid services, and wider healthcare reform are all avenues to explore in the ongoing effort to improve comprehensive oncological care for patients."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a aggressive cancer associated with high morbidity and mortality globally. Reliable biomarkers are urgently needed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and survival outcomes in patients with HCC. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of cleavage stimulation factor subunit 1 (CSTF1) in HCC. METHODS: CSTF1 expression in different cancer types, including HCC, was analyzed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess CSTF1 expression in clinical samples. Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate associations between CSTF1 expression and the clinical characteristics of patients with HCC. Furthermore, Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed to identify signaling pathways and biological functions linked to differentially expressed genes. The prognostic significance of CSTF1 in HCC was assessed via the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox univariate and multivariate analyses. Immune cell infiltration was investigated through single-sample GSEA and the CIBERSORT algorithm. Three nomograms were constructed to predict overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression free interval (PFI) rates at 1, 3, and 5 years after diagnosis. RESULTS: CSTF1 expression was elevated in HCC cases and closely correlated with multiple clinical features. Elevated CSTF1 expression was strongly associated with various cancer-related pathways and the immune microenvironment. The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that elevated CSTF1 expression predicts poorer prognostic outcomes in individuals with HCC. CSTF1 hypermethylation was also related to poor patient outcomes. The constructed nomograms for OS, DSS, and PFI achieved concordance indices of 0.631, 0.719 and 0.787, respectively. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that CSTF1 can serve as a novel prognostic biomarker for HCC. Evidence from immunohistochemistry and bioinformatics analyses supports CSTF1 as a prognostic indicator and a potential therapeutic target. This discovery could enhance diagnostic precision and improve survival outcomes for patients with HCC."

    "abstract": "Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer accounting for a majority of cases. Despite advances in targeted therapies and immunotherapy, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, resistance mechanisms, and limited preclinical models hinder treatment efficacy. Traditional cancer models, including 2D cell cultures and animal models, often fail to accurately replicate the lung's complex architecture, microenvironment, and biomechanical cues, leading to poor predictive performance in drug development. Microfluidic-based organ-on-a-chip technology offers a promising alternative by integrating human-derived cells with precisely controlled perfusion, mechanical cues, and tumor-stroma interactions in physiologically relevant 3D models. These platforms enable the study of lung cancer biology, drug responses, and patient-specific therapeutic outcomes with improved accuracy. In this review, we discuss recent advancements in microfluidic systems for recapitulating normal lung physiology and 3D lung cancer microenvironment, covering various microfluidic platforms with applications in disease modeling and drug testing. Unlike other review articles, we bring first-hand insights from clinicians about the current treatment practice for lung cancer and the clinical utilities of lung cancer-on-a-chip models, which bioengineers have been seeking. We also highlight the translational potential of these systems in personalized oncology and the need for interdisciplinary collaborations, particularly with clinicians, to enhance their clinical impact."

    "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and fatal lung disease, significantly increases the risk of lung cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, the shared genetic mechanisms driving IPF and LUAD comorbidities remain poorly understood, necessitating integrated multi-omics investigations. Through bulk and single-cell transcriptomic analyses, we identified 308 shared differentially expressed genes enriched in lipid metabolism and immune-inflammatory processes. Additionally, single-cell profiling revealed significant alterations in epithelial cells and macrophage populations between LUAD and IPF tissues, underscoring their role in disease progression. Furthermore, the copy number variation profiling identified a premalignant epithelial subpopulation in IPF exhibiting transcriptional signatures resembling LUAD malignant epithelial cells, and trajectory analysis illustrated a potential temporal progression toward malignancy. To identify co-causal genes, we performed weighted gene coexpression network analysis, defining modules associated with key cell types involved in comorbidities. Moreover, leveraging 101 algorithm combinations across ten machine learning approaches, we constructed a robust prognostic model, pinpointing CHST6 as a top prognostic gene consistently upregulated in both LUAD and IPF. Functional validation confirmed that CHST6 promotes lung cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In conclusion, our findings elucidate the shared molecular landscape of LUAD and IPF and propose that CHST6 is a promising co-disease therapeutic target."

However, trends in the prescription of PIMs and the factors associated with deprescribing PIMs in these patients remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in the prescription of PIMs and explore the factors associated with the deprescribing of PIMs in patients with advanced cancer in Japan. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using medical claims data. METHODS: We analyzed patients aged >65 years who were diagnosed with cancer 6 months before death and died between December 2017 and August 2023 in the city of Mito, Ibaraki prefecture, Japan. Sociodemographic, clinical, and prescription data were collected at 6 months (M6), 3 months (M3), and 1 month (M1) before death. PIMs were assessed according to the OncPal Deprescribing Guidelines. RESULTS: The mean age of 1269 patients was 80.6 years, and 62.2% were male. PIMs were prescribed to 77.0% at M6, 76.4% at M3, and 70.0% at M1 (p < 0.001, M6 to M1). The factors associated with deprescribing at least one PIM from M6 to M1 included female sex, number of medications at M6, number of comorbidities, admission to a palliative care unit, and admission to a general ward. CONCLUSION: In patients with advanced cancer, PIM use decreased as they approached death. Deprescribing PIMs was more common in females, patients with polypharmacy and comorbidities, and patients admitted to hospitals, especially palliative care units."

OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of available therapeutic regimens and to identify the optimal treatment strategy for patients with disease progression following EGFR-TKI therapy. DESIGN: This is a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES AND METHODS: Databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov, along with conference proceedings from January 1, 2020, to June 1, 2025, were searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing treatment options for advanced NSCLC patients resistant to EGFR-TKIs were eligible. We identified the optimal therapeutics through comparison of the surface under the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA). RESULTS: Overall, 19 RCTs involving 4,039 participants were identified. Meta-analysis indicated that sacituzumab tirumotecan (Sac-TMT) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS; hazard ratio [HR] 0.20, 95% credible interval [CI] 0.13-0.30) and overall survival (OS; HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.20-0.66) compared to conventional chemotherapy as evidenced by its superior SUCRA values (0.997 for PFS and 0.946 for OS). Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) also demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy outcomes. Specifically, Sac-TMT showed statistically superior PFS benefits relative to nearly all comparator regimens, including immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based and bispecific antibody (bsAb)-based strategies (all p < 0.05). Amivantamab in combination with lazertinib and chemotherapy (SUCRA = 0.816) and ivonescimab combined with chemotherapy (SUCRA = 0.779) both exhibited capabilities in prolonging PFS. Notably, the triplet regimen was associated with the highest incidence of severe-grade AEs compared to all other treatment options. CONCLUSION: Sac-TMT, Dato-DXd, and bsAbs-based regimens were identified as the most efficacious options with manageable toxicity for advanced NSCLC patients who progressed after EGFR-TKIs. These findings underscore the pivotal role of innovative therapeutic agents, illuminating potential treatment avenues for this difficult-to-treat refractory population.

Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown promising activity, robust predictors of benefit remain lacking. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is widely used but has limited accuracy. Routine blood tests and serum tumor markers (STMs) are inexpensive and universally available, yet their prognostic value in pLELC has not been systematically evaluated. OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate a composite blood-based score integrating hematologic indices and STMs for predicting immunotherapy outcomes in advanced pLELC. DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective cohort study. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 254 patients with advanced pLELC treated with ICIs across six tertiary centers in China. Baseline hematologic indices, serum biochemistry, and STMs were collected. A composite Blood Routine & Tumor-Marker Score (BRTS) was constructed using LASSO Cox regression with progression-free survival (PFS) as the endpoint. Patients were stratified into high- and low-BRTS groups, and prognostic value was validated in an independent cohort. Nomograms combining BRTS with clinical variables were developed and internally validated. RESULTS: High BRTS was associated with significantly shorter PFS and overall survival (OS) in both training (hazard ratio (HR) for PFS = 4.59; OS = 6.86) and validation cohorts (HR for PFS = 5.37; OS = 3.87; all p < 0.001). In multivariate analyses, BRTS remained an independent predictor alongside treatment line, regimen, and liver metastasis, whereas PD-L1 expression lost significance. Nomograms incorporating BRTS demonstrated good discrimination (C-index ~0.79), calibration, and clinical net benefit. Prognostic utility was consistent across treatment lines. CONCLUSION: The BRTS, derived from widely available laboratory tests, robustly stratified immunotherapy outcomes in advanced pLELC and outperformed PD-L1 alone. This simple, low-cost tool may facilitate individualized treatment decisions and warrants prospective validation."

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify factors associated with pain during fusion prostate biopsy to optimize the experience of prostate cancer diagnosis and monitoring. The primary goal was to assess the relationship between pain during viscous lidocaine (lido) instillation and periprostatic nerve block with the overall pain experienced by patients undergoing prostate biopsy. METHODS: We queried our database for patients who underwent transrectal magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion prostate biopsy from March 2020 to July 2023 and had complete pain scores (1-10) recorded during lido instillation, periprostatic nerve block, biopsy, and overall. RESULTS: A total of 779 patients were included. The mean pain scores during lido instillation, periprostatic block, biopsy, and overall were 0.11, 2.8, 3.5, and 3.6, respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed that patients with a pain score during lido instillation of >2 (odds ratio [OR] = 10.28; p=0.027) patients with periprostatic block of >2 (OR = 7.49; p<0.001), black patients (OR = 2.838; p<0.001), and patients on active surveillance (OR = 1.648; p=0.003) were more likely to experience the upper quartile (UQ) of overall pain. Men with abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) findings were less likely to develop the UQ of overall pain than men with normal DRE findings (OR: 0.586; p=0.004). This finding suggests that digital rectal examination during the initial clinic visit can help identify patients who may benefit from sedation during prostate biopsy, potentially improving patient comfort and procedural experience.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Arsenic exposure is a well-established risk factor for bladder cancer, but substantial individual variability in susceptibility suggests the potential role of effect modifiers. The gut microbiome, which is influenced by diet, may regulate arsenic metabolism and toxicity. The Dietary Index for Gut Microbiota (DIGM) quantifies the potential of diet to foster a beneficial gut ecosystem, yet its role in modifying arsenic-related carcinogenesis remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the potential interaction between urinary arsenic levels and DIGM on bladder cancer risk. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2018. Bladder cancer status was obtained through self-reported medical questionnaires. Total urinary arsenic was measured using ICP-DRC-MS, and arsenobetaine was subtracted to estimate toxic inorganic arsenic exposure. DIGM was constructed based on 24-h dietary recall data. Weighted multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations, and interaction was tested by including a product term (urinary arsenic*DIGM) and assessed on both additive and multiplicative scales. RESULTS: Among 4,889 participants (mean age 47.47 years; 50.34% male), 585 had bladder cancer. After adjusting for covariates, elevated urinary arsenic was associated with increased bladder cancer risk (OR: 2.22, 95% CI: 1.53-3.22). Interaction analysis revealed a significant multiplicative interaction between urinary arsenic and DIGM (P-interaction = 0.022). Stratified analysis showed a strong positive association between urinary arsenic and bladder cancer in participants in the lowest DIGM tertile (OR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.46-2.61). This association was significantly attenuated and became non-significant in those in the highest DIGM tertile (OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 0.89-1.44). Measures of additive interaction (RERI = 0.47, AP = 0.31) further supported a synergistic effect. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that a diet promoting a healthier gut microbiota, as indicated by a higher DIGM score, may attenuate the association between urinary arsenic exposure and bladder cancer risk. These results indicate that dietary intervention could be a strategic approach to mitigate urinary arsenic-related cancer risk, highlighting the importance of diet-gut-microbiome interactions in environmental carcinogenesis."

Despite advances in conventional therapies, including chemotherapy and targeted agents, treatment resistance and adverse side effects highlight the need for novel, safer, and more effective therapeutic strategies. Hesperidin (HSD) and hesperetin (HST), bioflavonoid abundantly found in citrus fruits, has emerged as a promising candidate due to its wide-ranging biological activities, particularly its role in modulating key molecular pathways involved in carcinogenesis. This comprehensive review explores the multifaceted anticancer potential of HSD and HST in the context of CRC, focusing on its ability to control programmed cell death mechanisms like autophagy and apoptosis, suppress chronic inflammation, and counteract oxidative stress-three pivotal hallmarks of tumor initiation and progression. Additionally, we examine the synergistic effects of HSD and HST with standard chemotherapeutic agents and its potential as a chemopreventive or adjuvant therapeutic compound. By consolidating preclinical and emerging clinical evidence, this review highlights the translational value of HSD and HST in CRC prevention and management. Understanding its molecular underpinnings may pave the way for HSD- and HST-based nutraceuticals and targeted therapies, contributing to a more personalized and integrative approach to CRC treatment."

This retrospective analysis aims to identify risk factors for failing to achieve a pathological complete response (pCR). Additionally, the study examines factors predicting survival outcomes in breast cancer patients who received NACT. Among 224 patients who underwent NACT between 2010 and 2020, 65 patients achieved pCR. The hormone receptor (HR) status, HER2 amplification, and biological subtype of breast cancer significantly affected the patient's ability to achieve a pCR. Stage of the disease, molecular type, and histological type of breast cancer were significant predictors of overall survival in breast cancer patients who achieved pCR after NACT. Notably, early-stage disease, the luminal subtype of breast cancer, and invasive mammary carcinoma of no special type (NST) were associated with a favorable prognosis.

NLR values were 2.07, 2.35, and 2.68 for no infiltration, < 50%, and >/= 50% myometrial infiltration, respectively (p = 0.033). MLR values were 0.20, 0.23, and 0.26 for the same categories (p = 0.029). PLR values were 119, 140, and 146 (p = 0.043). For LVSI, NLR was 2.17 in negative and 3.23 in diffuse (p = 0.010), while MLR showed 0.20 vs 0.24 (p = 0.054), and PLR showed 125 vs 141 (p = 0.033). Multivariate analysis indicated myometrial infiltration had the strongest correlation with inflammation indices (beta 0.07, CI 95% 0.01-0.13, p = 0.041). Inflammation indices (NLR, MLR, PLR) significantly correlate with myometrial infiltration, LVSI positivity, and higher grading in early-stage endometrial carcinoma, with myometrial infiltration showing the strongest association. These findings suggest that inflammation indices could aid in the prognostic evaluation of endometrial carcinoma. Further research is needed to understand the prognostic implications fully."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: In this section of the INDEPSO-ISPSM consensus, we aimed to address some general principles and technical aspects of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) that could be broadly applied in all patients treated by CRS for peritoneal malignancies. METHODS: The modified Delphi technique was used with two rounds of voting. Fifty-six out of 62 (90.2%) invited surgeons agreed to vote. There were 38 questions on two pain topics: quantitative prognostic indications, radiological and pathological evaluation and general principles of cytoreductive surgery. A consensus was reached if any of the options received 70% or more votes (> 90% = strong consensus). RESULTS: In round 1, 52/56 (92.8%) panelists voted and in round 2, 51/56 (90.1%). A consensus was reached on 31/38 (81.5%) questions (strong consensus on 13/38-34.2%). The panel strongly recommended having a specialist pathologist, a thorough pathological evaluation of CRS specimens, routine recording of radiological peritoneal cancer index and resection of organs like the rectum and spleen when they are directly involved by tumour. The panel did not recommend major hepatectomies, total gastrectomy and pancreaticoduodenectomy as part of CRS when these are required to resect peritoneal disease and total pelvic exenteration with CRS. Perfusion of the thoracic cavity during HIPEC was recommended only when the pleura was involved. A consensus was also reached on two-stage surgeries, visceral and target-region resections. No consensus was reached on routine use of chest tubes, smoke evacuators and timing of preoperative imaging. CONCLUSION: A strong consensus was reached on some widely accepted practices amongst peritoneal oncologists as well as indications for visceral and target-region resections. These recommendations could directly be applied to clinical practice. This consensus points towards a need to standardize technical aspects of CRS by a larger international consensus amongst expert surgeons.

    "abstract": "Newer systemic treatments are driving us towards axillary conservation to reduce morbidity and enhance quality of life without oncological compromise in breast cancer (BC) patients. It is important to identify which patients might benefit from a more conservative approach to the axilla by studying the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) responses in different subgroups. The aim of the study is to evaluate real-world pathological response rates in breast cancer patients in accordance with latest NACT regimes and also to identify the subsets ideal for axillary de-escalation. This single-centre study at Sri Shankara Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Bangalore, reviewed a prospectively maintained database from January 2023 to May 2024 including all non-metastatic BC patients undergoing surgery after recommended NACT. A total of 224 patients were included for analysis. Pathological complete response (PCR) was achieved by 31.69% (71/224), with 55.3% (124/224) achieving axillary PCR (APCR) and 35.26% (79/224) achieving breast PCR (BPCR). According to subtypes, 65.11% PCR was observed in Her2 subtype, followed by 44.2% in the triple positive, 24.4% in triple negative and 10% in hormone receptor positive. Among patients with cN0 disease, 91.3% (21/23) had APCR, while 63.2% (91/144) of cN1 patients were down-staged to ypN0 and only 17.9% (7/39) of cN2 down-staged to cN0. Combining the Her2-positive and triple-positive groups, 96.2% (51/53) of patients with BPCR had APCR. Pre NACT clinical nodal stage, ER and Her2 neu status can predict APCR with sensitivity of 74.0% with CI of 95% and specificity of 69.0% with CI of 95%. Our study suggests that HER2-positive and triple-positive patients with cN0 and cN1 converted to cN0 are potential candidates for de-escalation of axillary surgery."

    "abstract": "Bayesian network (BN) models are graphical structures called the directed acyclic graphs, which model the probabilistic dependencies between variables. In the context of predictive modeling, BN models can intuitively represent the collective contribution of factors in predicting an outcome variable. This study is aimed at developing a BN model in predicting the two-year mortality of patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity (OCSCC). The secondary data for the study was obtained from a published cohort study conducted within the institute after ethical approval. The strength of association of the potential prognostic factors with the outcome variable was determined using multiple logistic regression. The hybrid BN model based on expert opinion and association matrix (BN-H) was developed. The conditional dependencies between the variables were incorporated as the thickness of edges between nodes. Multiple logistic regression (MLR) and BN models based on tree augmented (TAN), expectation maximization (EM), and gradient boosting (GB) method was developed for comparison. Gini coefficient, sensitivity, specificity, misclassification rate, and area under the ROC curve were estimated in both training and testing data for comparison. Age, smoking, alcohol, stage of the cancer, and treatment modality were found be significant prognostic factors for mortality. The association matrix determined that there were significant inter-dependencies between variables. The BN-H model was found to have a comparable predictive accuracy to the MLR model. Bayesian network model developed with expert opinion and appropriate association matrix can be an alternative to existing predictive models for binary outcome.

This retrospective study analyzed 230 patients with rectal cancer who underwent LAR following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) between 2016 and 2024. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, surgical factors, and postoperative outcomes were examined. Chi-square and t-tests identified significant variables, which were further analyzed using logistic regression. ROC curve analysis determined cutoff values, sensitivity, and specificity for significant predictors. Anastomotic leakage was observed in 18 patients (7.8%). BMI was significantly higher in the AL group (27.89 +/- 3.69) compared to the non-AL group (25.67 +/- 3.54, p = 0.012). Operative duration was also longer in patients with AL (243.69 +/- 86.89 min vs. 192.37 +/- 72.4 min, p = 0.005). Logistic regression identified BMI (OR: 1.164, 95% CI: 1.018-1.330, p = 0.027) and operative duration (OR: 1.006, 95% CI: 1.001-1.012, p = 0.018) as independent predictors of AL. ROC analysis showed a BMI cutoff of 27.77 (sensitivity 61.1%, specificity 75.9%) and an operative time cutoff of 175 min (sensitivity 88.9%, specificity 43.4%). Higher BMI and prolonged operative duration independently predict AL after LAR. Addressing these factors preoperatively may help reduce complications and improve patient outcomes."

For the first time, this study investigated the compatibility of suspicious findings observed in mammograms of patients before surgery with CDP findings based on pathology findings as the gold standard. This prospective study was conducted on 26 patients with breast cancer candidates for conservative surgery with suspicious findings in the initial mammography, who were referred to our institute between April 2024 and September 2024. Ultrasound and mammography findings before surgery, frozen findings, CDP during surgery, and pathology results of patients were collected using a checklist. A breast fellowship and a radiologist, with the guidance of the positions and hourly codes of the Quadrants of Breasts, classified the position of suspicious findings in CDP and mammography. The concordance rate between the two methods was evaluated with the Kappa coefficient. Based on mammography findings, 9 (36.4%) suspicious findings were observed in the lateral, 8 (30.8%) in the medial, and 5 (19.2%) in the interior of the breast. These results were confirmed in the CDP findings. Based on the pathology findings, 7 cases of lesions were of invasive type (4 IDC and 3 ILC), while the frozen results were free in all cases. The degree of concordance and correlation between mammography and CDP findings was 96.2%. Mammography findings were almost completely consistent with intraoperative CDP findings. Suppose there are suspicious findings in the mammography of patients who are candidates for conservative breast surgery. In that case, CDP can be used intraoperatively for these slight distortions of the surrounding tumor tissue to reduce recurrence and cost and increase patient survival."

    "abstract": "The last 25 years have seen considerable changes in cancer epidemiology in India. Numerous studies have shown increases in certain cancers, such as lifestyle and tobacco-related cancers, with decreases in other cancers, such as cervical cancer. Despite the development of the National Cancer Registry Program in 1964, cancer is not a notifiable disease in India, and there remains no comprehensive cancer registry with data relying on regional and hospital-based registries. This retrospective study aimed to elucidate the trends in cancer epidemiology in the West Bengal region over a period of 25 years (1996-2020). Our analysis includes retrospective data from the hospital electronic records of a tertiary cancer institution in Kolkata which serves patients from Kolkata as well as Eastern, North-Eastern India and Bangladesh. We collected data from 189,485 patients (of which 135,578 had malignant disease) who were diagnosed during this time. Data was visualised using Microsoft Excel and analysed using linear trend analyses and the Mann-Kendall test. We saw significant increases in breast cancers amongst females and oral cavity cancers amongst males, consistent with other studies across various regions of India. In contrast, we identified significant decreases in the frequency of cervical cancers amongst females and cancers of the ear, nose and throat regions amongst males. We report that the cancer epidemiology in West Bengal is generally following that of the rest of India. Our study has revealed important trends in cancer frequency in West Bengal and has illustrated important areas for targeting preventative and/or screening interventions.

    "abstract": "Pulmonary metastases from uterine cancer are rare, and clinical significance of pulmonary metastasectomy (PM) in such cases remains unclear due to limited data. We retrospectively reviewed 10 female patients who underwent PM for metastatic uterine cancer between 2010 and 2023. Clinical and pathological data, including disease-free interval (DFI), number and size of metastatic lesions, and overall survival (OS), were analyzed. Univariate analysis was performed to identify the prognostic factors. The median age of patients at the time of PM was 63 years. The primary tumor originated from the uterine body in seven cases and from the cervix in three cases. Histological subtypes included endometrioid adenocarcinoma (n = 6), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 3), and serous carcinoma (n = 1). Eight patients had a single metastasis and two had multiple lesions. The median DFI was 16 months and the median OS following PM was 96 months. Univariate analysis revealed that a single metastasis (p = 0.0182) and DFI >/= 10 months (p = 0.0215) were significantly associated with better OS. Tumor size >/= 12 mm showed a trend toward improved survival (p = 0.0529). PM was beneficial for histological confirmation in patients with uncertain preoperative diagnosis. In all 10 cases, imaging could not distinguish pulmonary metastasis from primary lung carcinoma. Thus, histopathological examination after PM was essential for final diagnosis. PM may provide diagnostic value and potential survival benefits in selected patients with uterine cancer, particularly in those with limited metastases and a longer DFI."

We did a 1:1 propensity score-matched analysis (PSM) on retrospectively collected data of all patients with PSROC patients treated at our center from January 2014 to December 2020. Patients were categorized into chemotherapy with secondary cytoreductive surgery (SCH) and chemotherapy alone (CH). PSM was done with baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazard model was used to compare survivals between the matched cohorts. We identified 96 patients (SCH, N = 29; CH, N = 67). After matching, there were 58 patients (29 in each group). SCH patients had better OS and PFS compared to CH in the matched cohort [median OS 40.27 versus 23.17 months (p = 0.002) and median PFS was 26.5 versus 8.6 months (p < 0.001)] respectively. In univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, treatment modality (SCH vs. CH alone) at recurrence was the only significant factor for both OS and PFS. Our series had no perioperative mortality, and the morbidity was manageable. In patients with PSROC, chemotherapy with secondary cytoreductive surgery resulted in better OS and PFS than chemotherapy alone, with acceptable perioperative morbidity and no perioperative mortality."

This study is aimed at preliminarily evaluating the effectiveness of the transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy vestibular approach (TOETVA) in the treatment of thyroid cancer in male patients. A prospective study was conducted on 42 male thyroid cancer patients treated with TOETVA from January 2019 to December 2023 at Hanoi Medical University Hospital. All the patients enrolled had tumors < 2 cm in diameter, no extrathyroidal extension, and cN0 status. Surgical and oncologic outcomes were analyzed. The mean patient age was 30.2 (17-56) years, with 85.7% having solitary tumors, mostly in the left lobe (54.8%). Papillary thyroid carcinoma (95.2%) was the predominant diagnosis. An mean tumor size was 8.5 mm. Lobectomies comprised 95.2% of surgeries. The mean operative time was 83.3 (60-150) min, and blood loss was minimal 6.3 (5-15) ml. Postoperative complications included transient hoarseness (4.8%) and mouth-opening difficulty (2.4%), with no permanent severe hypocalcemia or hoarseness. No cases of completion thyroidectomy or conversion to open surgery due to TOETVA failure were recorded. On average, 3 (0-12) lymph nodes were harvested, with a median of 2 (0-8) malignant nodes. Most tumors were T1 (95.2%), and pN1a was observed in 52.4% of the cases. Patient satisfaction with cosmetic results was universally high. TOETVA is a safe and effective option for male patients with early-stage thyroid cancer, offering minimal complications and excellent cosmetic results. Further studies are needed to expand its application to broader population."

While conventional mastectomy and the Grisotti flap technique remain options, alternative approaches such as reverse batwing and perforator-based flaps offer additional possibilities for breast conservation. The Grisotti flap, despite its utility, has limitations, particularly in non-ptotic breasts, where it may lead to lateral fullness and suboptimal cosmesis. In this report, we describe the \"Reverse Bay of Bengal\" modification of the Grisotti flap, designed to address these limitations by preserving chest wall perforators and avoiding excessive lateral bulging.

Recent publications have suggested a minimally invasive approach to achieve similar outcomes in patients with limited peritoneal cancer spread. This manuscript reports the results of a consensus exercise that aimed to provide recommendations on minimally invasive cytoreductive surgery (MI-CRS) for which evidence is limited. The consensus was carried out using the modified Delphi technique. There were 23 questions on two main topics: staging laparoscopy and minimal invasive cytoreductive surgery. A total of 56/62 invited surgeons agreed to vote on the consensus. A consensus was achieved if any option received > 70% of votes, and a strong consensus was set at > 90%. In rounds I and II both, 50/56 (89.28%) panellists voted. Overall, a consensus was achieved on 18/23 (78.2%) questions (strong consensus on 17.3%). The panel strongly recommended that MI-CRS should not be performed if there is incomplete evaluation during the staging laparoscopy. The panel considered PCI > 10, previous extensive abdominal surgery, large intraabdominal masses, gross diaphragmatic involvement and multi-focal mesenteric disease as contraindications to MI-CRS. There was no consensus obtained on the technique of HIPEC after MI-CRS and on performing MI-CRS in high-grade tumours and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanced ovarian cancer. This consensus laid down recommendations for technical aspects of staging laparoscopy and patient selection and technical aspects of MI-CRS. The results should spur more collaborative studies across the world to address key questions related to MI-CRS.

Various studies have taken different parameters to define visceral obesity. The aim of our study was to find the impact of visceral fat volume (VFV) on perioperative outcome in laparoscopic colorectal surgery. The primary objective of our study was to find the correlation of VFV within postoperative complications. Sixty-five patients with colorectal cancer who underwent elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery were included in the study. We assessed the VFV from a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis using FUJIFILM: SYNAPSE 3D software. Patients were divided as per percentiles into three groups < 25th: low; 25th-75th moderate and > 75th High VFV. Intraoperative difficulties were assessed based on the surgeon's subjective scoring of difficulty, operative time, estimated blood loss, and conversion to open surgery. Postoperative outcomes were measured in terms of time to start an oral semisolid diet, length of hospital stay, surgical site infections, and overall 30-day morbidity according to the Clavien Dindo classification. Data was analysed to identify the effect of visceral fat volume on perioperative outcomes in laparoscopic colorectal surgeries. The overall rate of major complications (i.e. > grade II Clavien Dindo) was 21.5%. Moderate and high VFV groups had 28.12% and 31.25% major complications, respectively. The correlation of VFV with major complications was found to be significant with p 0.04. Overall operative time was 252.24 min, 289.31 min, and 301.44 min in low, moderate, and high VFV groups, respectively (p-value of < 0.005). High VFV had statistically significant blood loss measured as haemoglobin mass loss of 88.84 gm as compared to 44.5 gm and 57.19 gm in low and moderate. Subjective scores of difficulty were also higher in high VFV as compared to moderate and low VFV groups but higher VFV had no direct relation with conversion to open surgery. VFV had no direct effect on post-operative time to start a semi-solid diet and length of hospital stay. High VFV had a higher inflammatory response postoperatively measured as a higher CRP value but was not statistically significant.

Over the years it has undergone several modifications but has still retained its status as the most popular scoring system for prostate. Using a systematic literature review, we aim to highlight the changes the Gleason scoring has undergone, their strengths and limitations as well the future directives. Gleason scoring underwent major changes from its original conception in the International Society of Urologic Pathology (ISUP) consensus meetings held in 2005, 2014 and 2019. The latest change in Gleason scoring makes it possible to report the scoring, help alleviate patient anxiety and has shown good reproducibility and less inter-user variability. Gleason scoring system is a popular tool among pathologists and clinicians alike owing to its flexibility, utility and dependability. With advancements in the medical field and the use of artificial intelligence, it is expected to undergo further tempering."

Hence, biomarkers identified in cervical cancer have significance in understanding the prognosis and reducing cervical cancer-related deaths. Elevated levels of Claspin, a key protein in checkpoint signaling and increased replication, have been seen in multiple solid tumors. The study included 80 cases with primary diagnosis of SCC cervix along with 10 cases of HSIL and 10 cases of cervical tissue with normal histological features. Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against P16 and claspin. Association of Claspin with P16 and clinicopathological parameters of carcinoma cervix was analyzed using chi-square test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered substantially significant. The average age of cervical carcinoma diagnosis in this study was 55 years, with a significant majority (73.75%) being post-menopausal. The study found block positivity for P16 in 83.75% of cases, indicating HPV-associated SCC. Claspin is a potential biomarker, highly expressed in SCC cervix (88.75%, p < 0.005), significantly higher than HSIL (50%) and normal tissue (0%). Increased Claspin expression was linked to P16 positivity but was not statistically significant. Claspin expression showed a significant association with postmenopausal status and presence of ulceroproliferative growth but not with other clinicopathological parameters such as age, parity, clinical findings, lymph node status, size of tumor, stage, grade, and TILs. This study has shown an increased expression of Claspin in cervical cancer. Drugs targeting Claspin has the potential to increase sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs like cisplatin."

The Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) was recently introduced to overcome the shortcomings of the CDC. This study aims to compare the Clavien-Dindo classification and the Comprehensive Complication Index in assessing post-operative complications. After elective surgery for Gastrointestinal malignancies, post-operative complications were recorded using the CDC and CCI scoring systems. CCI was calculated from free online software (https://www.cci-calculator.com). Using Pearson and Spearman correlations, both scores were correlated with the ICU stay and hospital stay. Between August 2021 and April 2023, 141 patients were included. The median number of complications per patient was 3 (range 1 to 10). The median CCI score was 39.3 (12.2 to 100). The median postoperative hospital stay was 8 days (range, 4-54 days). The median length of ICU stay was 1 day (range, 0-22 days). Using the Pearson and Spearman correlations, there was a strong correlation between both the CDC and CCI with the duration of hospital stay (correlation coefficient, 0.706 vs. 0.731, p < 0.001) and ICU stay (0.768 vs. 0.755, p < 0.001). The Comprehensive Complication Index and the Clavien-Dindo classification highly correlate with the length of hospital stay and ICU stay, with the CCI score having an edge in correlating better with hospital stay. Due to its dynamicity, the CCI score may be a better tool to depict postoperative complications in morbidity meetings and publishing literature."

However, the adherence to these practices remains suboptimal in many resource-limited settings, with little data on primary management quality and referral practices. We retrospectively analyzed the records of 105 breast cancer patients referred to our tertiary care centre between January 2023 and December 2024, after undergoing primary evaluation and surgery at secondary care facilities. None of the patients underwent bilateral mammography or core needle biopsy, despite clear indications. Ninety-six patients had lumpectomy based solely on fine needle aspiration cytology, without axillary staging. Post-lumpectomy, all patients were referred for chemotherapy, regardless of further surgical indications. Documentation of primary surgery was often inadequate, leaving gaps in critical treatment details. Our findings reveal a significant divergence from standard breast cancer management protocols at secondary care facilities. Such non-adherence to recommended diagnostic assessments and surgical staging compromises patient outcomes. Addressing these gaps requires targeted education for secondary care physicians, infrastructural upgrades, and systemic reforms to ensure adherence to evidence-based guidelines. Bridging these gaps is essential to improve breast cancer outcomes in resource-constrained settings."

    "abstract": "The shame and stigma scale was developed to specifically analyze the shame and stigma in head and neck cancer patients. However, being a numerical rating scale, it gives a continuous number for each patient, which is difficult for clinicians to interpret. The present study aimed to classify the numerical rating score of the shame and stigma scale into the discrete categories of normal, mild, moderate, and severe. Data from 197 patients with head and neck cancer was obtained using the shame and stigma scale. The shame and stigma scale has a global score and four domains, with a high score representing a high rate of shame and stigma. The numerical score was used to create classification schemes to derive the optimum cutoff points for discrete categories. The variability of the optimal classification scheme was quantified using a bootstrap resampling procedure by repeating the patient sample a thousand times. The classification scheme with the highest F value in ANOVA was used to assign a cutoff to classify the numerical score into normal, mild, moderate, and severe categories. Seven classification schemes were created for global score, appearance domain and stigma domain. Five classification schemes were created for the regret domain, and three classification schemes were created for the speech domain. The optimum cutoff values for global score were 0-10 (normal), 11-30 (mild), 31-50 (moderate) and 51-80 (severe) (F = 1044.105); cutoff values for appearance domain were 0-6 (normal), 7-14 (mild), 15-22 (moderate) and 23-32 (severe) (F = 1344.50); cutoff values for stigma domain were 0-2 (normal), 3-7 (mild), 8-12 (moderate) and 13-20 (severe) (F = 1590.94); cutoff values for regret domain were 0-2 (normal), 3-6 (mild), 7-10 (moderate) and 11-16 (severe) (F = 924.03); and cutoff values for speech domain were 0-2 (normal), 3-5 (mild), 6-8 (moderate) and 9-12 (severe) (F = 1008.38). The present study classifies the numerical rating score of the shame and stigma scale into discrete categories i.e. normal, mild, moderate, and severe by obtaining the optimum cutoff points as per maximum F value. Clinicians can use these cutoff values to classify shame and stigma numerical scores as normal, mild, moderate, and severe for easy interpretation."

BC remains a complex and multifaceted disease that poses a significant threat and is a public health concern. Region-specific molecular subtyping is required with the updating trends of the disease. The study was conducted retrospectively at the Central Reference Laboratory, inDNA Life Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, from January 2021 to December 2023. A total of 301 BC patients were recruited in the study from multiple institutions in a consecutive manner across West-Bengal and Odisha. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (version 8.3.0) software. The study included 294 (97.6%) women and 7 (2.3%) men. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) was the most common histopathologic type observed in 90.2% (n = 267) of patients. Majority of them were diagnosed in the 4th to 6th decade of their life (n = 173; 58.45%) with a mean age of 50.8 years. ER + expression was detected in 104 (35.1%) and PR + in 87 (29.4%) cases. HER-2/neu overexpression was observed in 89 (30.1%) cases. A striking 39.8% (n = 118) triple-negative or basal-like status was noted in the cohort. Immunohistochemistry-based classification remains the gold-standard method for sub-typing of BC. The study highlights alarming numbers of TNBC cases and is the most prevalent sub-group in the 40-60 years age-group of eastern-Indian BC cases in comparison with region-specific incidence. Additionally, concurrent use of HER2/neu FISH on equivocal cases revealed a HER2/neu positivity conversion rate of 28%. Apart from studying the routine histo-molecular attributes, BRCA-based genetic screening needs to be brought into the mainstream testing for all clinically diagnosed BC cases.

    "abstract": "Head and neck cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide which exhibits a continuous rising trend of prevalence and incidence rates across the globe. Head and neck cancer is found to be more prevalent in developing nations like India where it is responsible for significant cancer-related mortality rate. We aim to analyze the prevalence, incidence, and mortality trends of head and neck cancers in India as per the latest Global Cancer Observatory (GLOBOCAN) 2022 estimates produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and disseminated as Cancer Today on GLOBOCAN website. The GLOBOCAN 2022 database includes seven types of head and neck cancers, including the lip and oral cavity, hypopharynx, nasopharynx, oropharynx, salivary gland, larynx, and thyroid cancer. These categories are made according to the International Classification of Diseases Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) based on anatomical location of tumor. The data was extracted for the prevalence, incidence, and mortality rate. The incidence rate trend was analyzed for 15 years, from 2003 to 2017. The estimated rise in the incidence rate was predicted until 2050. The highest prevalence was reported for lip and oral cavity cancer which was 26.31, 17.07, and 6.4 for the 5 years, 3 years, and 1 year per 100,000 individuals respectively. The age-standardized rate (ASR) and crude incidence rate were highest for the lip and oral cavity cancers (9.91 and 10.22 respectively). The incidence rate of larynx and thyroid cancer remains stabilized over 15 years from year 2003 to 2017. The percent risk of rise of new cancer cases by the year 2050 is maximum for oropharynx cancer (103.9%). GLOBOCAN is one of most compressive global cancer databases which provides important insight regarding cancer across 185 countries. Head and neck cancer in India was found to impose a high prevalence, incidence, and mortality rate. Healthcare agencies need to derive an action plan to reduce the rising risk of head and neck cancer in India."

    "abstract": "Over the past four decades, gynecologic oncology has grown significantly as an academic discipline. In its early stages, only a handful of cancer centers offered certified training programs, providing a basic orientation to the field but lacking comprehensive, in-depth training. The discipline has become more structured today by establishing fellowship and degree programs at various tertiary-level cancer centers nationwide. However, training quality and depth still vary considerably across institutions. This nationwide survey was conducted to evaluate the strengths of current training programs and identify areas for improvement based on feedback from current trainees and early-career gynecologic oncologists. An online survey questionnaire was disseminated to a targeted group via WhatsApp messaging, adhering to specific inclusion criteria, and remained open from September 15, 2023, to November 16, 2023. The respondents comprised Gynecologic Oncology trainees enrolled in Master of Chirurgiae (MCh) or Doctorate of National Board (DrNB) programs, second-year fellows, and Gynecologic Oncologists who had completed their training within the past two years. The survey consisted of 57 questions designed to assess various aspects of training, academic activities, and expectations from the program. It also aimed to evaluate the overall exposure of trainees, focusing on the frequency and range of surgeries they participated in and their satisfaction with the surgical training. The collected responses were systematically tabulated and analyzed to derive meaningful insights. Out of 107 responses, 99 were analyzed. The findings indicated satisfactory exposure to the overall curriculum and a wide range of clinical conditions. A significant proportion (72.9%) of participants reported active involvement in open surgeries, including extensive procedures such as peritonectomy and sentinel node techniques, and receiving feedback on academic performance. However, concerns were highlighted regarding insufficient exposure to minimally invasive surgery, particularly robotic techniques, as well as specialized procedures like Heated Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) and ultra-radical surgeries. This comprehensive survey, the largest of its kind among Gynecologic Oncology trainees in India, sheds light on the strengths (\"hits\") and areas for improvement (\"misses\") within the current training curriculum. Key \"hits\" include satisfactory exposure to open surgeries and feedback mechanisms, alongside the adoption of techniques like peritonectomy and sentinel node procedures. However, the \"misses,\" such as limited training in minimally invasive surgery-especially robotics-and specialized procedures like Heated Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) and ultra-radical surgeries, underscore further enhancement. This study serves as a valuable reference for evaluating and refining training programs. It provides a framework for future audits to standardize and elevate the quality of gynecologic oncology training in India.

    "abstract": "The global cancer burden is expected to rise over the next few decades, with an equally significant increase in the need for cancer surgical services. It is well known that gross inequities exist in accessing cancer surgical care on the global stage. The goal of this manuscript is to highlight the inequities in accessing cancer surgical care and outline some strategies to address them. We used GLOBOCAN 2022 to document the current and predicted rise in the future cancer burden for the various income groups, as defined by the World Bank Group. Data from relevant agencies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), World Bank Group, and relevant publications were used to quantify current and future workforce (surgical and relevant other health professions) needs, number of imaging modalities, hospital capacity, and healthcare expenditure per capita. Our study demonstrates that there are extreme variations in cancer burden on the global stage as well as inequities in all domains of cancer surgical care pathways, based on income status. Low-income (LICs) and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) will experience a proportionally larger increase in cancer burden over the next few decades. At the same time, LICs and LMICs were noted to have severe shortages in all elements of the cancer surgical care pathways ranging from the number of cancer surgeons and other oncology professionals, hospital beds, and imaging modalities, when compared to high-income countries (HICs). Health care expenditure per capita also demonstrated variations with the highest rates noted in the HICs. This study highlights the inequities in access to cancer surgical care on the global stage. To address these challenges, we have proposed some strategies derived from the 2023 Lancet Oncology Commission on Global Cancer Surgery report, which can realistically be accomplished in a timeframe of 5-15 years."

This prospective study was done on 35 females after obtaining approval from the institute ethics committee. DM and CEM were performed in standard craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) positions and the findings were recorded as per the 5th edition of ACR-BIRADS lexicon. The findings included background parenchymal density and enhancement; presence of mass (size, shape, margin, density, enhancement features); presence of any satellite lesions or additional lesions on DM/CEM and its enhancement characteristics; any non-mass enhancement and associated findings. Sampling of the additional findings was done for equivocal radiology. The mean age was 45 years (26-76 years) and the mean size of index lesion was 3.44 cm (+ / - 1.25 cm) on DM. Presence of intraductal extension was seen in 5 patients (14.3%) on DM, whereas CEM could delineate it in 11 patients (31.4%). In addition, CEM showed better detection rate of multifocal disease (42.9% vs 65.7%), multicentric disease (17.1% vs 31.4%), and synchronous breast lesion (2.9% vs 5.7%). The accuracy and precision of tumour size measurement, multifocality and multicentricity were higher with CEM as compared to DM. Therefore, CEM may be a good alternative modality to assess the multifocality, multicentricity and disease extent in the preoperative setting and for those with limited access or contraindication to MRI."

    "abstract": "Treatment for colorectal cancer has improved significantly over the last few decades. The feasibility of treating colorectal cancer recurrence is also increasing. The surveillance protocol applied influences the pattern of diagnosis of recurrence. Adherence to intense follow up protocols may be challenged by limitation of resource, pointing to the scope of forming tailored strategies. The objectives were to determine the rate of salvage, disease-free and overall survival, the types of local therapy applied, morbidity associated with radical local treatment, and the factors influencing survival of patients followed up using a low intensity regimen after curative treatment for recurrent colorectal cancer. We included patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer recurrence from January 2010 to December 2016 at the institute. The clinicopathological and treatment details were collected. Treatment outcomes were analyzed and compared with the baseline characteristics. Of 109 recurrences, 26 (23.8%) were offered curative therapy. Locoregional treatment modalities consisted of four cases of pelvic exenteration (18.2%), four (18.2%) resections of peritoneal deposits including two (9.1%) multivisceral resections, four (18.2%) hepatic resections, two (9.1%) lung metastasectomies, one (4.5%) retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, and two (4.5%) ablative procedures. Four (18.2%) and one (4.5%) cases received chemoradiotherapy and systemic therapy alone. Surgical resection had 6.2% Clavien-Dindo grade III, 25% grade II, and 25% grade I morbidities. With a median follow-up of 95 months, the median DFS and OS were 48 months and 55 months for curatively treated patients. The rate of curative therapy was low in a low-intensity follow-up regimen (23.8%). Yet, curative treatment including complex resections offers a survival advantage with acceptable morbidity rates, in select patients with limited disease affecting a single region."

This study was conducted with the ethical approval of the ethics committee and has also received the ICMR STS grant. Data of 138 patients who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer in the last 5 years were analyzed for a history of cholecystectomy. Those who developed colorectal cancer within a year of their cholecystectomy were excluded from the study to minimize protopathic bias. The control group was composed of healthy individuals. Data extracted was organized in Microsoft Excel and was analyzed about the main objective. Chi-square test was used to find the association between cholecystectomy and colorectal cancer. RESULTS: The percentage of cholecystectomy in the colorectal cancer group was 6.5% vs 2.1% in the control group (P value = 0.072). There were no statistically significant associations between diabetes, hypertension, CKD, alcohol intake or smoking, and the incidence of colorectal cancer. CONCLUSION: Based on our study, there is no evidence to support an association between colorectal cancer and cholecystectomy."

    "abstract": "Mortality in patients with gastric cancer (GC) remains high. Therefore, accurate postoperative staging is particularly important for follow-up/treatment and prognostic fate of these patients. In this single-centre study, we analysed retrospective data from 170 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed GC who underwent radical resection. The objective of this observational, retrospective cohort study was, therefore, to evaluate prognostic value of the positive-to-total lymph node ratio (PLNR) and log odds of positive lymph nodes (LODDS), in addition to known predictors of survival, such as TNM staging, grading and histopathological subtypes of GC. All clinically relevant variables (including patient demographics) were initially assessed evaluated as candidate predictors of overall survival (OS) in univariable regression analysis. The final prognostic model for overall mortality included five clinical factors predictive of OS. PLNR was statistically significant associated with 3-year survival (Cramer's V = 0.429, eta(2) = 0.178; p < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex and disease stage, PLNR remained an independent predictor of mortality (p = 0.016; OR 1.230; 95% CI 1.039-1.455). We have found that the increased PLNR is associated with poor 3-year survival in patients with GC who underwent radical/curative resection. Inclusion of PLNR produced a model of better fit and increased its predictive power for the survival outcome of GC patients."

    "abstract": "Staging of positive axilla that showed negativity after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is a subject of controversy. In this situation, sentinel node biopsy is debatable due to high false negative rates. This study evaluates the feasibility of axillary targeted surgery after lymph node charcoal tattooing for clinically positive nodes prior to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. This study included 30 cases of breast cancer with clinically suspicious axillary nodes who were planned for neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. They underwent fine needle biopsy from the suspicious node with simultaneous injection of carbon suspension. After therapy, those who showed negativity on repeat ultrasound had exploration with excision of the tattooed and the sentinel node. Axillary lymph node dissection was performed if any of both was pathologically involved. A total of 30 patients were carbon-labelled before systemic therapy. Twenty-one were included in the final analysis, while 9 patients were excluded. Carbon-tattooed lymph node was in 28/30 patients (93.3%). In patients who had targeted dissection, the charcoaled and sentinel nodes were the same in 19/21 patients (90.4%), and in this group, 15/21 patients had positive targeted dissection, and we proceeded to axillary dissection in 4 patients who showed positive nodes. Targeted LN was not the sentinel node in two patients; in both, all nodes were negative. Carbon tattooing of axillary lymph nodes provides a safe, cheap, and reliable alternative to marker clips without the need for image guidance to locate the marked node which provides an excellent alternative in low-resource countries with the advantage of durable tissue staining."

    "abstract": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatic cancer both represent prostate lesions affecting males. These conditions occur due to the presence of inflammation within the prostate gland. This inflammatory process causes tissue injury and cellular modifications, which are primarily through the cytokine synthesis and secretion. Distinctly, IL-6 (interleukin 6) emerges as a vital part in prostate disease, exerting a profound influence on its development. In addition, the anti-inflammatory cytokines' inclusion, such as tumor necrosis factor beta-1 (TGFbeta-1), is evident in the development of both benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic cancer. In recent discoveries, researchers are more focused on complex interaction between IL-6 and TGFbeta-1 in the prostate pathophysiology. The article aims to assess the IL-6 and TGFbeta-1 immunohistochemical expression in prostatic benign and malignant lesions. Formalin-fixed samples that were encapsulated in paraffin were utilized in this work. They were collected from the department of histopathology et al.-Ramadi-Teaching Hospital from patients who were diagnosed with hyperplasia and carcinoma of the prostate. To detect the expression of TGFbeta-1 and IL-6, immunohistochemical analysis was performed on the tissue sections. The intensity of stromal staining was determined to assess the stromal expression. Concerning prostate cancer, the relationship between cytokine expression and the Gleason index score was discussed in this work. The results confirm that the TGFbeta-1 was presented in the epithelial and stromal components of prostate tissue with a higher concentration in the stroma. The TGFbeta-1 stromal expression was increased in cases of benign hyperplastic changes in comparison to prostate carcinoma (p < 0.05). On the contrary, the epithelial expression of TGFbeta-1 did not show any significant differences between the two cases. On the other hand, IL-6 expression was localized in the epithelial component, with higher levels observed in prostate cancer in comparison to hyperplasia. There was no substantial correlation found between the Gleason score and IL-6 expression. According to our results, the immunohistochemical detection of both TGFbeta-1 and IL-6 exhibited variations between benign and malignant samples."

Despite a reported incidence of major adverse cardiac event (MACE) in up to 6%, some Asian studies show no significant change. We aimed to find the cardiovascular effects of ADT in Indian men with PCa. In this prospective cohort study, men who underwent treatment for PCa from January 2022 to January 2023 were included. The ADT arm comprised patients with locally advanced and metastatic PCa who received ADT. The control arm included localized PCa patients who underwent radical prostatectomy without any ADT treatment. The primary outcomes were the incidence of MACE, changes in the Framingham risk score (FRS), ECG, and echocardiography at 1 year. Secondary outcomes were changes in the body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio, lipid profile, glycaemic parameters, and ankle brachial pressure index at 1 year. Forty cases and 23 controls were analyzed. There were three (7.5%) MACE in the ADT group at 1 year with no events in the control group. The ADT group had a significant increase in the mean FRS (2.54 +/- 4.45 vs 0.67 +/- 2.13; p = 0.021), weight (2.83 +/- 2.97 vs. 0.94 +/- 1.8 kg; p = 0.004), BMI (0.9 +/- 1.08 vs. 0.32 +/- 0.66 kg/m(2); p = 0.016), and HbA1c (0.54 +/- 1.64 vs. 0.18 +/- 1.08%; p = 0.023) compared to controls. A total of 7.5% of patients who received ADT developed MACE at 1 year. FRS, BMI, and HbA1c increased with ADT. Rigorous follow-up for cardiovascular and metabolic effects is essential in patients who receive ADT."

In this study, we attempt to determine the prognostic significance of LNY per neck node level for oral tongue SCC. This retrospective observational study includes 302 patients with oral tongue SCC who were operated in our unit between 2017 and 2022. Relevant data were collected, and patients followed up for at least 24 months. LNY per level was calculated and correlated with recurrence and overall survival. A total of 344 neck dissections were performed on 302 patients. On average, 36 nodes (36.05 +/- 15.02) were harvested per neck dissection. The maximum yield was found in level IIa, 6.72 (6-10), irrespective of pathological node positivity. On multivariate analysis, a higher LNY at level IIa significantly correlated with recurrence, along with other factors. We found that LNY of 10 or more nodes from level II might be a more sensitive predictor of recurrence than overall LNY per neck dissection. This could be because level II nodes receive a majority of lymphatic drainage from the oral tongue. Total LNY may be impacted by yield at other levels and may lull the surgeon into a false sense of security, when clearance of the most crucial nodal basin at level II remains suboptimal.

    "abstract": "Traditionally considered to function solely as signaling molecules within the central nervous system (CNS), neurotransmitters are now recognized as key regulators of systemic homeostasis. They modulate interactions among the nervous, immune, and metabolic systems and influence the development of various diseases. This review systematically summarizes the fundamental properties of major neurotransmitters, including their biosynthesis, receptor subtypes, and key signaling pathways, and analyzes their context-dependent roles in cancer, neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), and inflammatory disorders. A primary focus is the three-dimensional regulatory principle that determines their effects, namely: the receptor type they bind to, cellular microenvironment, and stage of the disease. These factors explain the bidirectional effects of neurotransmitters in disease. This review also evaluates current therapeutic approaches targeting neurotransmitter pathways, ranging from receptor-specific drugs to emerging combination therapies, and discusses challenges in clinical translation, such as off-target effects of nonspecific drugs and variable efficacy across disease types. By linking the fundamental mechanisms of neurotransmitter function to clinical challenges, this review provides a comprehensive framework for exploiting the neurotransmitter-immune axis to develop precise therapeutic strategies aimed at improving outcomes in cancer, NDDs, and inflammatory disorders."

    "abstract": "Cellular plasticity, the ability of cells to dynamically alter their phenotypes, is a key driver of tumor evolution. This process is a hallmark of cancer which enables the acquisition of malignant traits, leading to metastasis, progression, and therapy resistance. It is governed by cell-intrinsic factors, such as genomic instability and epigenetic reprogramming, and extrinsic stimuli from the tumor microenvironment. However, a unified framework is still needed to position plasticity as the central process that links these drivers to diverse cancer hallmarks. In this review, we first explore how plasticity enables key steps of tumor evolution, including tumorigenesis, metastasis driven by epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP), therapy resistance, and cancer stem cell (CSC) dynamics. We then summarize the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that govern this adaptability. Finally, we discuss clinical advances in monitoring and targeting plasticity and highlight how new spatiotemporal technologies can address current research challenges. This review provides a framework positioning cellular plasticity as a central mechanism in cancer evolution, connecting its fundamental drivers to clinical translation. By synthesizing the latest advances, we offer perspectives for developing therapies that integrate prediction, monitoring, and targeting of plasticity to proactively guide cancer evolution toward manageable outcomes."

Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021, this study examined the NCD burden in Qatar, including the burden of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, neurological conditions, and mental health disorders attributable to dietary risks, low physical activity, smoking, and high body-mass index (BMI). In 2021, lifestyle-related risk factors were responsible for 64.8% of NCD deaths and 33.2% of DALYs in Qatar. High BMI emerged as the top contributor, accounting for 24.5% of deaths and 13.9% of DALYs, followed by poor diet and smoking. The burden of high BMI-related NCDs increased over the past 30 years, with a 71.4% increase in deaths and a 54.3% rise in DALYs, while the impact of smoking declined. Compared to other Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Qatar had a higher NCD burden, particularly for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes linked to obesity.

Using dual-energy X-rays and iodinated contrast agents, CEM highlights enhancing abnormalities and is highly sensitive in detecting malignancies, particularly in dense breasts. Its advantages include rapid image acquisition and cost-effectiveness, making it useful in screening, diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of chemotherapy response. Emerging applications of radiomics and artificial intelligence are poised to improve lesion characterization and predict molecular subtypes. While promising, CEM also has limitations, including increased radiation exposure, risks associated with contrast, potential for false results, and difficulty in widespread integration because of the limited availability of CEM-guided biopsy. Overall, CEM is a valuable and cost-effective tool with increased clinical relevance. This review provides a comprehensive summary of CEM for clinical and future considerations."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 77 PCa cases in 60 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for biopsy-proven prostate cancer. The MR Images of the prostate were interpreted in consensus by two experienced radiologists (aged 3 and 35 years). We retrospectively reviewed the MRI images according to PI-RADS v2.1 and recorded the scores from T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging, and peak relaxation rate (R2(*)) for each lesion at three different time points: 1) bpMRI (T2WI, DWI, and ADC), 2) mpMRI1 (T2WI, DWI, ADC, and DCE), and 3) mpMRI2 (T2WI, DWI, ADC, DCE, and peak R2(*)). The diagnostic performances of bpMRI, mpMRI1, and mpMRI2 in detecting csPCa using PI-RADS V2.1 were evaluated. Additionally, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of DCE-MRI and peak R2(*) for csPCa detection. RESULTS: The area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for diagnosing csPCa with PI-RADS v2.1 in all lesions and peripheral zone (PZ) lesions were not significantly different between the bpMRI, mpMRI1, and mpMRI2 protocols (p > 0.05). DCE-MRI was better than the peak R2(*) for diagnosing csPCa in PZ lesions (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: mpMRI using split dynamic MRI has diagnostic performance similar to that of bpMRI for detecting csPCa using PI-RADS v2.1."

    "abstract": "Since the introduction of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS), prostate MRI has become an essential tool for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer, determining tumor stage, and guiding targeted biopsy. However, variability in image quality across institutions continues to affect diagnostic accuracy. To address this issue, the Prostate Imaging Quality (PI-QUAL) scoring system was developed as a standardized framework for evaluating the quality of prostate MRI. PI-QUAL v1 established the first quality control system for multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) but had limitations, including the inability to assess biparametric MRI (bpMRI) and a strong reliance on biopsy correlation. The updated PI-QUAL v2 simplified technical requirements, incorporated bpMRI assessment, and introduced a reproducible 3-point scale with adjustment rules that balance quality assurance with the diagnostic advantages of mpMRI. Factors influencing image quality include magnetic field strength and susceptibility- and motion-related artifacts. Complementary approaches, such as the Prostate Signal Intensity Homogeneity Score and artificial intelligence-based evaluation tools, have also been proposed. Overall, PI-QUAL v2 enhances reproducibility and broadens clinical applicability, providing a practical framework for ensuring high-quality prostate MRI. Future progress is expected through standardized data collection, structured training, and multidisciplinary collaboration."

    "abstract": "Biochemical recurrence, marked by rising prostate specific antigen levels, is a common and challenging clinical scenario following curative treatments for localized prostate cancer (PCa), such as radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT). An accurate assessment is critical for detecting local recurrence and distinguishing it from distant metastatic disease, thereby guiding salvage therapies. While multiparametric MRI has demonstrated strong performance in detecting local recurrence, the lack of standardized reporting has historically limited its clinical utility and reproducibility. To address this variability, an international consensus-based Prostate Imaging for Recurrence Reporting (PI-RR) system was introduced in 2021. PI-RR adopts a 5-point Likert scale, similar to Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System, but places greater emphasis on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and incorporates knowledge of the prior primary tumor location to grade the likelihood of recurrence. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of the PI-RR system, detailing its imaging acquisition recommendations, specific scoring criteria after RT and RP, clinical implications, and future directions within the evolving landscape of PCa imaging."

Multiparametric MRI offers a noninvasive alternative for monitoring disease progression, yet the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System has limited capacity in interpreting longitudinal changes. To address this gap, the Prostate Cancer Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation (PRECISE) framework was developed to standardize the reporting of serial MRI changes using a 5-point scale, thereby enhancing interpretive consistency, facilitating multidisciplinary communication, and informing timely intervention. The 2024 PRECISE v2 update incorporated standardized imaging quality assessment, refined subcategories for stable disease, quantified progression criteria, and clarified comparison standards, enabling more personalized follow-up strategies. This review synthesizes the development, core features, and clinical implications of PRECISE v1 and v2, highlighting their potential to advance MRI reporting standardization and risk-adapted management in AS for prostate cancer, while outlining key areas for future research."

By applying box-counting methods on brightfield microscopy images, we estimated the fractal dimension (Df) and its logarithmic (ln(Df)) and functional (ln(Dtf)) forms to highlight spatial irregularities in the tissue architecture. While Df and ln(Df) exhibited long-tailed distributions distinguishing healthy from cancer tissues, ln(Dtf) provided significantly improved differentiation by emphasizing local structural variations. Additionally, multifractal analysis revealed broader f(alpha) vs alpha curves in cancerous samples, reflecting higher heterogeneity. IPR analysis based on light localization further demonstrated increased nanoscale variations in mass density, reflecting higher structural disorder in cancer tissues. Combining these complementary approaches creates a robust framework for measuring tissue complexity and holds great potential to improve microscopic diagnostic methods for brain cancer detection."

    "abstract": "Personalized neoantigen vaccines represent a promising immunotherapy approach that harnesses tumor-specific antigens to stimulate anti-tumor immune responses. However, the design of these vaccines requires sophisticated computational workflows to predict and prioritize neoantigen candidates from patient sequencing data, coupled with rigorous review to ensure candidate quality. While numerous computational tools exist for neoantigen prediction, to our knowledge, there are no established protocols detailing the complete process from raw sequencing data through systematic candidate selection. Here, we present ImmunoNX (Immunogenomics Neoantigen eXplorer), an end-to-end protocol for neoantigen prediction and vaccine design that has supported over 185 patients across 11 clinical trials. The workflow integrates tumor DNA/RNA and matched normal DNA sequencing data through a computational pipeline built with Workflow Definition Language (WDL) and executed via Cromwell on Google Cloud Platform. ImmunoNX employs consensus-based variant calling, in-silico HLA typing, and pVACtools for neoantigen prediction. Additionally, we describe a two-stage immunogenomics review process with prioritization of neoantigen candidates, enabled by pVACview, followed by manual assessment of variants using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). This workflow enables vaccine design in under three months. We demonstrate the protocol using the HCC1395 breast cancer cell line dataset, identifying 78 high-confidence neoantigen candidates from 322 initial predictions. Although demonstrated here for vaccine development, this workflow can be adapted for diverse neoantigen therapies and experiments. Therefore, this protocol provides the research community with a reproducible, version-controlled framework for designing personalized neoantigen vaccines, supported by detailed documentation, example datasets, and open-source code."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast reconstruction after mastectomy improves quality of life for breast cancer patients. As more late-stage patients undergo reconstruction, it is essential to understand how treatment regimens and radiation impact outcomes. This study compared early- and late-stage breast cancer patients, examining comorbidities, reconstructive details, complications, and satisfaction. METHODS: A total of 989 patients (903 early-stage; 86 late-stage) who underwent breast reconstruction between January 2011 and February 2025 were reviewed. Cancer staging followed the National Cancer Institute definitions: early-stage (I-IIIA) and late-stage (IIIB-IV). RESULTS: Late-stage patients had higher rates of diabetes (P = 0.003), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P < 0.001), and radiation (P < 0.001), whereas early-stage patients more often received adjuvant hormonal therapy (P = 0.006). Hormone receptor profiles differed: late-stage patients were more likely to be human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (P < 0.001), whereas early-stage patients were estrogen receptor-positive (P < 0.001) and progesterone receptor-positive (P = 0.004). Early-stage patients more often underwent 2-stage expander reconstruction (P = 0.002) and implant-based reconstruction (P = 0.039), whereas late-stage patients more frequently had delayed reconstruction (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in implant, flap, or donor-site complications, or in BREAST-Q satisfaction scores. CONCLUSIONS: Breast reconstruction is feasible and safe in late-stage breast cancer patients. Despite greater comorbidities and more aggressive disease, late-stage patients achieve complication rates and satisfaction comparable to early-stage patients. Future research should refine protocols to address the specific needs of late-stage patients, emphasizing quality of life and patient-centered outcomes."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Darolutamide, a novel androgen receptor inhibitor, significantly improved outcomes in the ARASENS trial when combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and docetaxel chemotherapy for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). In China, the regimen has been reimbursed since December 2023, expanding real-world accessibility. PSMA imaging-guided focal therapy enables precise localization of residual or oligometastatic lesions and may complement systemic control. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the real-world efficacy and safety of darolutamide-based triplet therapy combined with PSMA imaging-guided focal treatment in patients with mHSPC. METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective study included 17 patients treated across three tertiary hospitals between June 2023 and June 2024. All patients received darolutamide (600 mg twice daily), ADT, and docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks for 4-6 cycles), followed 4-6 weeks later by focal therapy (surgery or radiotherapy) based on multidisciplinary team (MDT) assessment and PSMA IMAGING findings. Data collection followed STROBE recommendations. The primary endpoint was PSA90 response; secondary endpoints included PSA </=0.2 ng/mL, PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), radiographic PFS (rPFS), and safety. RESULTS: Seventeen patients with predominantly low- to intermediate-volume metastatic disease were analyzed. The PSA90 response rate was 94.1%, and 82.4% achieved PSA </=0.2 ng/mL. Median PSA-PFS and rPFS were not reached at a median follow-up of 16 months. The 12-/18-month PSA-PFS rates were 88% and 65%, while the corresponding rPFS rates were 94% and 76%. Grade 1-2 myelosuppression (64.7%) and fatigue (47.1%) were most common; grade 3 neutropenia occurred in two patients (11.8%) without grade >/=4 events. Focal therapy was well tolerated, with no severe complications. CONCLUSION: Darolutamide-based triplet therapy combined with PSMA-guided focal intervention achieved deep biochemical responses and durable disease control with manageable toxicity in real-world Chinese patients with mHSPC. The multicenter design and standardized methodology support the feasibility of this multimodal approach, which warrants validation in larger prospective studies."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Although farrerol exhibits promising antitumor properties against various cancers, its potential therapeutic effects on colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unexplored, and the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Based on network pharmacology, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and in vitro experiments, this study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms of farrerol in the treatment of CRC, thereby providing new research directions for CRC therapy. METHODS: This study employed network pharmacology to screen for potential therapeutic targets and pathways of farrerol in CRC, followed by preliminary validation of target validity through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, in vitro experiments were conducted to verify the antitumor effects of farrerol against CRC. RESULTS: Network pharmacology identified 12 key targets: CCNA1, CCNA2, CCNE1, CDC25B, CDK2, CYP19A1, ESR1, ESR2, HSP90AA1, PTPN1, RAF1, and SRC. The molecular docking results revealed that the binding energies of farrerol with all target proteins were as follows: farrerol-CCNA1 (-8.6 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-CCNA2 (-7.0 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-CCNE1 (-7.4 kcal.mol(1)), farrerol-CDC25B (-7.3 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-CDK2 (-10.1 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-CYP19A1 (-8.4 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-ESR1 (-3.3 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-ESR2 (-8.9 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-HSP90AA1 (-10.4 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-PTPN1 (-7.6 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-RAF1 (-4.5 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-SRC (-9.9 kcal.mol(-1)), farrerol-VEGFA (-8.5 kcal.mol(-1)), and farrerol-KDR (-9.0 kcal.mol(-1)). These data indicate that farrerol can spontaneously bind to the target proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated favorable interactions within the KDR-Farrerol and VEGFA-Farrerol complexes. In vitro experimental results demonstrated that farrerol could inhibit the proliferation and migration of CRC cells, induce cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, and suppress the protein expression of VEGFA, VEGFR2, and p-VEGFR2. CONCLUSION: This study, for the first time, validated the antitumor effect of farrerol against CRC through network pharmacology, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and in vitro experiments. The findings indicate that the ability of farrerol to inhibit the proliferation and migration of colorectal cancer cells may be associated with the induction of G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest and the regulation of VEGF signaling pathway activation via binding to VEGFA and KDR."

    "abstract": "Common kidney diseases include acute kidney injury, diabetic kidney disease, kidney cancer, and other related conditions. Ginsenosides, the principal bioactive constituents of ginseng, have been widely reported as therapeutic agents against these disorders. However, recent advances regarding their efficacy in kidney diseases have not been comprehensively synthesized. This review addresses this gap by summarizing current findings on the mechanisms and therapeutic targets of ginsenosides. Literature from PubMed, Web of Science, and other databases was systematically retrieved using keywords such as ginsenosides, acute kidney injury, diabetic nephropathy, renal cell carcinoma, lupus nephritis, and aging-related kidney injury. Evidence from cell-based and animal studies demonstrates that ginsenoside compound K, Rg1, Rg3, Rh2, Rb1, Rb3, Rg2, and Rg5 are the most frequently reported for kidney protection. Mechanistically, ginsenosides modulate multiple signalling networks, including NF-kappaB, PI3K/AKT, MAPK, TGF-beta/Smads, PPAR, SIRT1, NLRP3, and Nrf2, to mitigate inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, pyroptosis, autophagy, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Taken together, these findings provide valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of ginsenosides and underscore their promise as candidates for the prevention and treatment of kidney diseases."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: CD82, a metastasis suppressor, is known to be palmitoylated, yet the functional significance of this modification in drug response remains unclear. This study investigates the role of CD82 palmitoylation in modulating chemosensitivity in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. METHODS: A palmitoylation-deficient CD82 mutant (C5A/C74A/C83A) was generated and expressed in MDA -MB-231 breast cancer cells. Protein palmitoylation was assessed via acyl-biotin exchange assay. Subcellular localization was analyzed by co-immunofluorescence with early endosome (EEA1) and vesicular (VPS4A) markers. Apoptosis was evaluated by measuring levels of apoptotic markers. The cytotoxic effect of the CD82 mutation in combination with gefitinib, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and camptothecin was quantified using TUNEL and Annexin V/PI assays. RESULTS: The CD82 palmitoylation-deficient mutant exhibited reduced palmitoylation and increased colocalization with EEA1 and VPS4A. This mutation triggered intrinsic apoptosis, as evidenced by elevated levels of Caspase-3, Cleaved-caspase-3, and Cytochrome C. Strikingly, it synergistically enhanced the cytotoxicity of both gefitinib and doxorubicin, significantly increasing apoptosis in treated cells. DISCUSSION: Our findings reveal a novel role for CD82 palmitoylation in regulating drug-induced apoptosis. Disruption of palmitoylation potentiates chemotherapy-induced cell death, providing a molecular rationale for targeting CD82 palmitoylation as a combinatorial strategy to overcome therapeutic resistance in TNBC."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the leading cause of cancer mortality, often requires platinum-based chemotherapy. Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) improves drug delivery, while PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors enhance antitumor immunity. Preclinical studies suggest synergy, but clinical evidence for combining these agents remains limited. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, this meta-analysis pooled data from four randomized controlled trials (1998 patients). Databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, web of science) were searched until January 2025. Trials comparing PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors + nab-paclitaxel-platinum (experimental) versus chemotherapy alone (control) were included. Outcomes included including objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), pathologic complete response (pCR), major pathologic response (MPR), and grade >/=3 adverse events (AEs). Statistical analyses used fixed/random-effects models. RESULTS: The combination therapy significantly improved ORR (OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.49-2.20, p < 0.001), PFS (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.58-0.73), and OS (HR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.91). In the resectable setting, neoadjuvant treatment resulted in higher pathologic complete response (pCR: 32.6% vs. 8.9%) and major pathologic response (MPR: 65.1% vs. 15.6%). Subgroup analyses showed enhanced benefit in PD-L1-high patients. The experimental group had increased risk of grade >/=3 thrombocytopenia (RR = 1.83) and immune-related adverse events (RR = 2.49). CONCLUSION: PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors combined with nab-paclitaxel-platinum enhance survival outcomes in NSCLC, particularly for PD-L1-high patients. Despite increased immune-related toxicity risks, this regimen represents a promising first-line option, warranting biomarker-driven selection and vigilant AE management. Future studies should address heterogeneity in platinum agents and optimize patient stratification."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is an aggressive malignancy that has poor survival. Management of ESCC depends on the resectability of the disease, certain patient characteristics, fitness for surgery, and the anatomic complexity of the disease location. Treatment options include either Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCR) followed by surgery or definitive Chemoradiation (DCR). While randomized trials have provided insights into both strategies, no large-scale retrospective real-world studies have been conducted to compare these approaches in diverse, unselected populations. This study assesses real-world outcomes of NCR versus DCR using the National Cancer Database (NCDB). METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the NCDB, focusing on patients with ESCC from 2004 to 2020. Propensity score matching (PSM) (1:1) was utilized. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were employed. RESULTS: N = 386 patients with esophageal cancer, with a median age of 64 years (IQR, 57.0-70.0), were identified. Patients were evenly distributed between the DCR and NCR groups, with a total of N = 193 participants. We further selected patients with ESCC, a total of N = 311 patients. NCR demonstrated a significantly extended overall survival (OS) compared to those who received DCR, with a median of 33.15 months vs. 20.5 months (P-value: 0.0069), respectively. Patients receiving DCR had significantly worse OS compared to patients receiving NCR with HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.05-1.81, p=0.0206. Patients with tumors in the thoracic esophagus (C15.3) showed significant survival benefit from surgery (p=0.0070), whereas no benefit was seen for cervical tumors (C15.0), likely due to anatomical complexity and limited sample size. CONCLUSION: NCR followed by surgery, when feasible, offers survival benefits for patients with ESCC, especially for locally advanced tumors in the thoracic esophagus."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Over the years, immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) axes have substantially improved clinical outcomes for patients with various types of cancer and stages. As a result, PD-L1 is the most recognized biomarker used to guide the selection of patients for treatment with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. To date, there are 4 regulatory agency-approved and commercially available immunohistochemistry assays used to quantify PD-L1 tumor expression, with each assay approved for use with a specific PD-(L)1 inhibitor. In this descriptive review, we concisely summarize the methodology and scoring methods of each assay, as well as some of the challenges associated with real-world use of these assay systems. RESULTS: Each assay system is optimized for specific therapies, with its own anti-PD-L1 antibody, protocol, scoring, and interpretation guidelines. Although the methodologies of the 4 PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assay systems are similar, differences in their antibody clones, protocol conditions, instrumentation, and scoring methods limit assay interchangeability. The assays are also highly sensitive; slight deviations to the protocol can increase the risk of misclassifying the PD-(L)1 tumor status of patients. As a result, pathologists are faced with choosing which assay to perform with a limited tumor sample as well as with the challenges associated with the scoring methods and differences in regional regulatory approvals and infrastructure. CONCLUSION: While the 4 approved PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assays provide clinical value, we offer pathologists suggestions to reduce the challenges associated with PD-L1 testing based on assay systems."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in patients with primary ovarian cancer (OC) following cytoreductive surgery (CRS). METHODS: Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to May 2025. The outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Treatment effects were quantified using pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). RESULTS: This meta-analysis included 10 studies [three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and seven observational studies] involving 1,668 patients. Patients with primary OC undergoing CRS who received HIPEC treatment in the experimental group demonstrated prolonged PFS (HR = 0.45, 95%CI = 0.29-0.69, p < 0.001, I (2) = 77.3%) and OS (HR = 0.59, 95%CI = 0.45-0.78, p < 0.001, I (2) = 60.6%) outcomes compared with the controls. In the experimental group, better PFS benefits were observed in Western populations, observational studies, interval cytoreductive surgery (ICS), and in patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-1. HIPEC was beneficial for patients with OC regardless of follow-up time >/=5 years (HR = 0.68, 95%CI = 0.49-0.96, p = 0.026) or <5 years (HR = 0.29, 95%CI = 0.13-0.63, p = 0.002), with a greater magnitude of benefit observed in the subgroup with follow-up <5 years. The subgroup analyses for OS revealed a consistent benefit of HIPEC across Western population, follow-up time >/=5 years, ICS, and ECOG 0-1. Benefit was associated with HIPEC in both RCT (HR = 0.75, 95%CI = 0.60-0.94, p = 0.013) and observational analyses (HR = 0.47, 95%CI = 0.33-0.68, p = 0.001), while the observed effect size was larger in the latter. Conversely, HIPEC was associated with a significant OS detriment in patients with an ECOG performance status of 2-3 (HR = 2.37, 95%CI = 1.07-5.23, p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: HIPEC appears beneficial to the prognosis of patients with primary OC following CRS, particularly after ICS. However, the administration of HIPEC in patients with ECOG 2-3 requires careful clinical consideration.

    "abstract": "Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in cellular protection against oxidative stress and the maintenance of redox homeostasis. In addition to modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS), Nrf2 influences lipid peroxidation (LP) and ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxide accumulation. Dysregulation of Nrf2 signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of several malignancies, where it affects tumor cell survival, chemoresistance, and metabolic reprogramming. This review summarizes current knowledge on the complex relationship between Nrf2 activity, LP dynamics, and ferroptotic mechanisms in cancer biology. It also highlights how Nrf2-dependent transcriptional programs not only regulate antioxidant responses but also contribute to cellular detoxification, metabolism, autophagy, and proteostasis, processes closely linked to tumorigenesis and cancer cell adaptability. Given that Nrf2 may have a dual role in cancer, either promoting cytoprotection or supporting tumor progression and chemoresistance, we discuss emerging strategies to selectively modulate Nrf2 and ferroptosis-related pathways to increase cancer cell sensitivity to oxidative damage and reduce resistance."

METHODS: This study included 277 NSCLC patients from Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, who underwent pretreatment (18)F-FDG PET/CT and EGFR mutation testing. A PET/CT signature (PCS)-nomogram was developed by comparing 10 machine learning algorithms for EGFR prediction. Leave-one-out cross-validation generated model-specific EGFR mutation probabilities for individual patients, and performance disparities were analyzed across clinical subgroups. Model performance was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic curve, Youden's index, decision curve analysis, and DeLong's test. RESULTS: The PCS-nomogram model, constructed using the partial least squares generalized linear models (plsRglm) algorithm, achieved optimal performance in predicting EGFR mutations in NSCLC patients (training cohort: area under the curve [AUC] = 0.80; validation cohort: AUC = 0.82). Smoking history caused statistically significant performance deterioration in seven of 10 machine learning models (|DeltaYouden's index| >/= 0.1). The PCS model demonstrated higher predictive performance in never-smokers than in smokers (AUC = 0.90 vs. 0.64; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A plsRglm-based PCS-nomogram model was proposed for the noninvasive prediction of EGFR mutations in NSCLC patients. Compared with smokers, radiomics-based EGFR mutation prediction demonstrated superior performance in never-smokers."

A key mechanism underlying this metabolic rewiring is the dynamic interplay between the host and gut microbiota. Gut microbiota derived metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids, polyamines and tryptophan derivatives, extensively reshape the CRC metabolic network and modulate the immune microenvironment, thereby influencing tumor progression and therapy response. This review systematically outlines the core features and molecular mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming in CRC, highlights the role of microbiota-host co-metabolism in regulating energy acquisition and immune-metabolic crosstalk, and discusses emerging therapeutic strategies that integrate metabolic targeting and microbiota modulation for precision intervention in CRC."

Non-invasive blood assays can reveal tumor-specific DNA alterations, enhancing personalized oncology. AIM: This study aims to investigate the clinical relevance of plasma-detected PIK3CA mutations in Vietnamese breast cancer patients, with a focus on subtype-specific outcomes. METHODS: PIK3CA hotspot mutations (H1047R and E545K) were detected in plasma from 196 BC patients. Associations with clinicopathological features and progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed. RESULTS: PIK3CA mutations were identified in 42.9% of patients with H1047R (31.6%) more prevalent than E545K (15.3%). Mutation rates were highest in HR+ subtypes and elevated in advanced or irradiated patients (p = 0.009). E545K was enriched in HR+ cases, while H1047R was more frequent in HER2+ tumors following radiotherapy. Among metastatic BC patients, those with PIK3CA mutations had shorter PFS (median, 7.0 vs. 15.0 months; p = 0.022), and univariate Cox regression showed increased progression risk (HR = 2.16), although not significant after multivariate adjustment. E545K was associated with lung (p = 0.047) and bone metastases (p = 0.012) and H1047R was enriched in brain metastases (p = 0.028). CONCLUSION: Plasma-detected PIK3CA mutations, particularly E545K and H1047R, exhibited subtype-specific associations with clinical outcomes, indicating that plasma analysis may provide complementary information for prognostic assessment in metastatic BC."

METHODS: This review examines recent advances in PDAC precision medicine by analyzing organoid-based drug screening platforms, mRNA immunotherapy developments, and integrated diagnostic technologies. RESULTS: Patient-derived organoids demonstrate strong predictive value for clinical outcomes, with drug sensitivity profiles correlating with patient responses (concordance >80%). Personalized mRNA neoantigen vaccines induce robust T-cell responses, with vaccine responders showing significantly prolonged recurrence-free survival (median not reached vs. 13.4 months). KRAS-targeted therapies achieve 10-15% response rates in G12C-mutant PDAC. Integration of spatial transcriptomics and liquid biopsy enables real-time molecular monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: The development of patient-derived organoids for drug sensitivity testing, personalized mRNA vaccines for immune activation, and precision diagnostic and therapeutic technologies represents complementary advances in PDAC.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer prognosis critically depends on tumor invasiveness, yet existing predictive tools lack accessibility and generalizability. We aimed to develop predictive models using comprehensive hematological profiling of routine tests to assess invasiveness and survival, improving clinical decision-making. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 512 cervical cancer patients who underwent radical surgery. A panel of hematological indices was evaluated, including inflammatory markers, coagulation parameters, and metabolic indicators. Machine learning (ML) algorithms innovatively integrated with traditional regression were employed for feature selection and model development. Models were internally validated by bootstrap methods for discrimination (AUC/C-index) and calibration. Clinical utility was assessed by decision curve analysis (DCA). Web-based Shiny applications of these models were deployed. RESULTS: Using routine hematological indices selected from ML-based methods, we identified the optimal variable set for each clinical outcome prediction model based on C-index comparisons. The multivariable analyses of these variables identified hematological parameters associated with cervical cancer progression and prognosis. TG, HGB, Eosinophil count, TCLR, and NAR acted as protective factors, while LDL, WBC, FAR, DDI, FLR, ENLR, SII and platelet count were risk factors linked to advanced disease features. In addition, Tbil and DDI were consistent risk factors for both recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). The models assessed invasiveness risk and survival risk in two critical periods: pre-surgery and post-surgery. The AUC values for predicting locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC), uterine body invasion (UBI), lymph node positivity (LNP), adjuvant therapy (ADT), parauterine invasion (PUI), and vaginal invasion (VI) were 0.714, 0.781, 0.781, 0.719, 0.756, and 0.700, respectively. For OS, the pre-surgery and post-surgery models achieved C-index of 0.875 and 0.906, while the RFS models yielded 0.790 and 0.863, respectively. All models showed AUC >/= 0.7, strong calibration, and positive net benefit on DCA. Interactive web tools were implemented based on these models. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive hematological profiling enables accurate prediction of cervical cancer invasiveness and survival during different decision-making periods. Our ML-enhanced, web-implemented models can enhance risk stratification and clinical decisions, particularly in resource-limited settings."

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) continue to redefine the therapeutic paradigm, their efficacy is limited to a specific proportion of patients. Radiotherapy (RT) is proposed as a strategy to enhance their efficacy, yet its clinical impact remains unclear, hindered by its double-edged sword effect on the immune system across variable settings. This review explores the landscape of RT-ICI combinations in NSCLC, analyzing available evidence in the light of current treatment guidelines. The presented data provide a foundation to validate computational models to predict clinical outcomes and inform tumor-immune dynamics. ClinicalTrials.gov was queried for trials involving both modalities, excluding studies incorporating other therapies except chemotherapy and surgery, other cancer types, or brain metastases. Of the 309 trials identified, 23 met the inclusion criteria, encompassing resectable (n=3), early-stage (n=3), locally advanced (n=10), and advanced NSCLC (n=7). In the neoadjuvant setting, the combination achieves a remarkable pathological response without significantly affecting surgical outcomes. Long-term survival benefit remains elusive. In early-stage unresectable tumors, ICIs are poised to replace chemotherapy as the preferred peri-radiation systemic treatment to prevent recurrences. Current data on locally advanced NSCLC confirm the feasibility of early ICI introduction, chemotherapy-free regimens, and individualized RT approaches. A definitive risk-benefit balance has yet to be established. In advanced stages, while the abscopal effect is well documented, statistical significance remains a concern, necessitating adequately designed studies powered to identify subpopulations most likely to benefit from the combination. Innovative, feasible approaches include RT and dual ICI, re-irradiation beyond progression, multisite micro-radiation, or partial irradiation of large tumors to activate a \"hot\" tumor microenvironment. In conclusion, while the combination of RT and ICI holds promise, significant challenges remain. A deeper understanding of immune dynamics is crucial. Additionally, the complexity of trial design, coupled with a lack of statistical significance in most available data, underscores the need for more phase 3 trials, the development of powerful biomarkers, and complementary approaches, such as virtual clinical trials, to accelerate progress and refine treatment strategies."

    "abstract": "Head and neck cancer (HNC) remains a pressing global health challenge, particularly in regions with lower socioeconomic status, where risk behaviors such as tobacco use and alcohol consumption are prevalent. Despite advances in treatment, reliable biomarkers for the early detection and monitoring of HNC remain lacking. The alpha-Gal carbohydrate epitope, absent in humans but present in other mammals, has garnered interest due to the natural presence of anti-alpha-Gal antibodies in the human immune repertoire, comprising approximately 1% of total circulating IgG. We investigated the role of anti-alpha-Gal IgG as a potential biomarker by performing ELISA on serum samples from a cohort of 11 patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck. Eight were older male patients, most of whom lived in rural areas and engaged in manual occupations. High rates of tobacco (81.8%) and alcohol consumption (63.6%) were observed, in line with established risk factors for HNC. These individuals showed significantly elevated anti-alpha-Gal antibody titers compared to non-cancer controls. Chemotherapy with cisplatin did not markedly affect antibody levels, suggesting consistent immune reactivity across treatment status. These results suggest that anti-alpha-Gal antibodies may serve as promising biomarker candidates in HNC and warrant further investigation to clarify their potential diagnostic and immunotherapeutic applications."

    "abstract": "Tumor cells undergo extensive metabolic reprogramming during malignant proliferation, with serine-a key nonessential amino acid-playing multiple roles in tumor metabolism. To maintain high serine levels, tumor cells upregulate phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase to enhance endogenous synthesis and concurrently increase exogenous uptake. Serine deprivation demonstrates antitumor potential across various malignancies; however, its clinical application remains limited by inadequate tumor selectivity and systemic toxicity. Recent advances in nanodelivery systems offer precise strategies to modulate tumor serine metabolism. Serine deprivation via these systems improves tumor-specific targeting while minimizing off-target toxicity to normal tissues. Therefore, this review aims to outline serine metabolism and its regulatory networks, evaluate the therapeutic potential and limitations of serine deprivation, and highlight recent advances in nanodelivery strategies targeting serine metabolism for cancer therapy, thereby providing insights for the development of novel anticancer approaches."

    "abstract": "Numerous clinical studies indicate that neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) with immunotherapy can significantly increase pathological complete response (pCR) and clinical complete response (cCR) rates to over 30-60%, substantially higher than the 15-20% observed with conventional NCRT. This allows more patients to become eligible for a Watch-and-Wait (WW) strategy, successfully preserving organ function. Several phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are currently underway. The combination of NCRT and immunotherapy holds promise for breaking the therapeutic impasse in proficient mismatch repair/microsatellite stability (pMMR/MSS) rectal cancer, markedly enhancing tumor regression and the potential for organ preservation. However, challenges remain for NCRT combined with immunotherapy in this population. First of all, there is an unmet need to identify predictive biomarkers for treatment response in pMMR/MSS rectal cancer. Next, treatment protocols require further optimization, specifically in determining the best radiotherapy fractionation schedule, its sequencing with immunotherapy, and the radiotherapy target volume. Otherwise, the phenomenon of \"pseudo-residual disease\" complicates traditional radiological assessment of cCR and must be overcome. Furthermore, the long-term survival benefits of combining radiotherapy with immunotherapy need further confirmation. This review provided a comprehensive and in-depth view of immunotherapy-based NCRT (iNCRT) in patients with pMMR/MSS rectal cancer and discuss the new opportunities and challenges this strategy presents for achieving organ preservation."

Recurrent anal canal carcinoma, which occurs in less than 1% of cases, is often accompanied by severe complications. Surgery plays a crucial role in improving patients' quality of life and controlling systemic paraneoplastic syndromes. This article reports a case of a 52-year-old female patient with recurrent anal canal squamous cell carcinoma (pT4bN0M0, Stage IIIB) 7 months after comprehensive treatment, complicated by rectovaginal fistula (RVF) and hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM). Following multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussions, an innovative approach combining free omental packing with gracilis myocutaneous flap was adopted for the treatment of an isolated sacrococcygeal recurrent tumor after anal canal squamous cell carcinoma surgery. A tumor mass with a maximum diameter of 12.5 cm was completely resected. Postoperative pathological examination confirmed that no cancer cells were detected in multiple biopsies of the free resection margin, achieving R0 resection. After surgery, the patient's serum calcium level and serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC) returned to normal. Meanwhile, the bilateral combined myocutaneous flaps survived completely, RVF symptoms disappeared, the patient's quality of life was significantly improved, and the survival prognosis was enhanced."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Robot-assisted surgery (RAS) has established itself as a minimally invasive approach in colorectal surgery, although evidence on its integration with Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS(R)) protocols in older patients remains limited. This study aims to describe short-term outcomes of RAS combined with a perioperative treatment according to the ERAS(R) protocols in patients >/=70 years. METHODS: This retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database includes all patients aged >/=70 years who underwent robotic colorectal resections at two German colorectal cancer centers between January 2019 and April 2024, managed perioperatively according to the ERAS(R) protocols. Primary endpoints were the patients' short-term perioperative outcomes, including duration of surgery, conversion rate, postoperative Intermediate-Care-Unit (IMC) admission, postoperative complications according to Clavien-Dindo, anastomotic leak and reoperation rate, length of hospital stay, and compliance to ERAS(R) guidelines. Results are presented descriptively without a comparator arm. RESULTS: A total of 161 patients (99 colon resections and 62 rectal resections) were included over the study period. Median duration of surgery was 153 (IQR: 130-197) minutes for colon and 243 (IQR: 120-467) minutes for rectal resections. Conversion rates were 1% and 4.8% respectively. Postoperative IMC admission was required in 9.1% (9 Patients) after colon and 12.9% (8 Patients) after rectal-resections, based on individual clinical assesement. Anastomotic leaks occurred in 7 cases (7%) following colon resections, with a total reoperation rate of 10%. Among rectal resections, the anastomotic leakage rate was 9.7% (6 cases) with a total reoperation rate of 16.1%. ERAS(R) compliance was 91.3% for colon- and 85% for rectal resections. Within the rectal cohort, postoperative complications were associated with a substantially lower perioperative ERAS(R) compliance compared to patients without complications (73.3% vs. 90.7%). Hospital stay was 5 days (IQR: 4-6 days) for colon- and 6 days (IQR: 5-11 days) for rectal resections. The 30-day readmission rate was 4% (4 cases) for colon and 8% (5 cases) for rectal resections. CONCLUSION: The integration of RAS colorectal surgery within ERAS(R) protocols appears feasible and is associated with acceptable short-term outcomes in elderly and comorbid patients. Nonetheless, these results should be interpreted as descriptive observations rather than inferential evidence."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Innovative strategies are crucial to meet the World Health Organization's 90/70/90 cervical cancer elimination targets, and to prevent millions of deaths by 2030. Women in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs) bear the greatest burden of cervical cancer, yet have limited access to cervical precancer treatment. Scalable solutions like self-administered intravaginal therapies can help close this treatment gap. In an ongoing Phase 1 trial of intravaginal artesunate pessaries as primary treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 (CIN 2/3), we evaluated the acceptability of this intervention among trial participants. METHODS: 17 participants completed in-depth interviews in their preferred language, focusing on their experiences with artesunate self-administration, including their interactions with the health system, partners, and community while on treatment. In the qualitative study, acceptability was defined as \"satisfaction with the product and willingness to use it in the future\" as well as \"correct and consistent use during the study.\" We conducted a thematic analysis using the socioecological framework. RESULTS: Participants in this Phase 1 trial were primarily low-income women, with limited formal education, and the majority were also living with HIV and had been on antiretrovirals for over a decade. Despite minimal prior experience with vaginal self-administration of medication, participants found the pessary acceptable and were highly motivated to get treatment for cervical precancer. Social support, educational interventions, and faith were crucial in enabling participants to complete the treatment protocol successfully. CONCLUSION: Kenyan women found self-administered intravaginal artesunate for treating CIN2/3 to be highly acceptable. Randomized studies of intravaginal artesunate and other topical therapies in LMICs are needed to evaluate their use in closing the treatment gaps in these settings. ETHICS STATEMENT: This clinical trial received ethical approval from the following Institutional Review Boards and regulatory authorities: the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (USA; approval #23-0902); Amref Health Africa Ethics and Scientific Review Committee (Kenya; approval #P1457/2023); the Kenya Pharmacy and Poisons Board (approval #ECCT/23/09/05), the National Commission for Science, Technology, and Innovation (NACOSTI) (Kenya; approval #NACOSTI/P/24/33045); and the Department of Health Services Kisumu County (approval #GN133VOL.XV/502).

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Sociocultural barriers including stigma significantly influence women's decisions around screening and treatment. OBJECTIVE: To explore how stigma influences women's experiences with cervical precancer care in the context of emerging self-administered topical therapies. DESIGN: A qualitative approach using convenience sampling. METHODS: Seventeen in-depth interviews were conducted between 2024 and 2025 in Kisumu, Kenya, with women who had been diagnosed with cervical precancer. Participants were recruited to self-administer intravaginal artesunate in a Phase I clinical trial, and interviews explored their experiences. Thematic analysis was conducted using the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework. RESULTS: All women discussed experiences indicative of enacted, anticipated, and internalized stigmas related to partner blame, disclosure, and imagining the diagnosis as an imminent death sentence. These stigmas were driven and facilitated by poverty and limited health care access, embarrassment around sexual health, community fears of cervical cancer death, patriarchal norms, and cervical precancer's disproportionate burden on women. Women with cervical precancer feel \"marked\" by medication usage, clinic visits, community expectations of a \"cancer\" appearance, or painful sexual intercourse. By exercising relational autonomy, women in this trial were able to navigate stigmas around sexual health and overcome the debilitating fear of death. They were ultimately able to complete the self-administered artesunate treatment course and initiate conversations in their communities to address stigmas around cervical precancer treatment. Nevertheless, stigmas caused delays to screening and treatment among some participants, while others experienced intimate partner violence or conflict during artesunate treatment. CONCLUSION: Stigmas around cervical precancer, artesunate usage, and abstinence requirements can deeply impact women's social experiences, intimate partnerships, and mental health. Future trials of self-administered therapies should integrate stigma reduction strategies developed in collaboration with participants and survivors.

Although often silent, functional paragangliomas may present with catecholamine hypersecretion and life-threatening complications. Their incidental discovery during cancer staging is exceptionally uncommon and poses unique therapeutic challenges. We report the case of an 82-year-old woman presenting with breast cancer, in whom staging investigations revealed a 6-cm functional paraganglioma of the celiac space. A multidisciplinary team prioritized paraganglioma resection before oncologic breast surgery. Preoperative alpha-adrenergic blockade was administered for 15 days. Surgery was complicated by catecholamine surges requiring intensive hemodynamic and critical care support. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. Histopathological analysis confirmed paraganglioma, and the patient was subsequently referred back for breast surgery. This case illustrates the rare incidental discovery of a hormonally active celiac paraganglioma during breast cancer staging. It highlights the need for multidisciplinary planning and emphasizes the role of perioperative critical care in optimizing outcomes of functional paragangliomas."

However, the role of mitochondria-related genes in PCa remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to discover novel biomarkers based on differentially expressed mitochondrial-related genes (DeMRGs) to aid in PCa diagnosis. In the present study, gene expression data from the Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases were combined with a mitochondrial-related gene list provided by the MitoCarta database to identify DeMRGs. Gene Ontology analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were then used to investigate the functions and related pathways of these DeMRGs. Subsequently, Cytoscape software and the STRING website were used to explore the transcription factors and microRNAs related to the DeMRGs. The degree of infiltration of immune cells in the immune landscape of patients with PCa and the controls was assessed using CIBERSORT. Finally, the correlation between characteristic DeMRGs and immune cell infiltration and mitochondrial respiration was analyzed. The results indicated that 6 characteristic genes, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta (ACACB), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), glycine amidinotransferase (GATM), methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase subunit 2, mitochondrial ribosomal protein L12 (MRPL12) and fatty acid synthase, were identified from the 60 DeMRGs. The results showed a close association between the characteristic DeMRGs and immune infiltrating cells. In addition, it was found that MRPL12, PDK4, ACACB and GATM were correlated with mitochondrial respiration. These 4 genes were selected as hub genes as they are closely related to gluconeogenesis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism and other mitochondrial metabolic pathways in PCa. In conclusion, 4 novel mitochondrial-related gene signatures that influence mitochondrial metabolism within the immune microenvironment were identified in PCa."

Radiotherapy (RT) and immunotherapy are increasingly used in cancer treatment, but the specific immune mechanisms underlying their effects remain to be elucidated. The present study analyzed publicly available datasets, in which the T-cell receptor beta chain (TCRbeta) repertoire in tumor-bearing mice treated with RT and immunotherapy, as well as the TCR repertoire of T cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of mice exposed to radiation doses of 0, 10 and 100 mGy were comprehensively evaluated. The results of the present study indicated that the diversity of the TCRbeta complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) in tumor-bearing mice decreased after RT, anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) and anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) treatment, especially in the RT and RT + anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 treatment groups. Furthermore, the CDR3 length markedly decreased in the RT group and markedly increased in the anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 groups. Next, the TCR profile of T cells differentiated from HSCs exposed to different radiation doses was examined. As the radiation dose increased, the TCRbeta diversity in mice gradually decreased and the degree of clonal expansion markedly increased, the percentage of private sequences (unique sequences detected in only a single mouse) was markedly increased and the degree of overlap was markedly decreased. Furthermore, there was a notable difference in the usage frequency of TCRbeta chain variable/joining gene segments among the different radiation dose groups. The present study demonstrated that RT and immunotherapy may alter the TCR repertoire owing to their effects on HSCs."

Traditional treatment strategies, primarily centered on extensive cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, have seen notable improvements through the integration of laparoscopy and robotic-assisted procedures. The safety and efficacy of minimally invasive techniques (MITs) have been demonstrated in early-stage EOC, although their applicability in advanced stages requires further investigation. Additionally, molecular-based and immunotherapies, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors and RNA-based treatments, offer promising adjuncts to MITs by targeting cancer-specific pathways with precision. Despite these innovations, patient selection, surgical expertise and adherence to oncological safety standards remain key factors in determining the efficacy and safety of MITs in EOC management. Future directions emphasize the need for standardized protocols, enhanced imaging techniques and real-time molecular monitoring, which aim to transition EOC management toward a minimally invasive, patient-centered approach. The present review discussed the advancements in MITs and their role in the management of EOC, with a focus on their impact on surgical outcomes, survival rates and patient quality of life."

The present study aimed to explore the pharmacological effect of TSIIA on lung cancer development and assess the potential underlying mechanism of action. Cell viability and proliferation were assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8 and 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine assays, respectively. Transwell assays were performed to determine cell migration and invasion. Histone H3 lysine 18 acetylation (H3K18ac) and histone H4 lysine 8 acetylation (H4K8ac) enrichment in the RING finger protein 123 (RNF123) promoter and the interaction between lysine acetyltransferase 2B (KAT2B) and the RNF123 promoter were analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The results indicated that RNF123 was weakly expressed in lung cancer cells, and its upregulation decreased lung cancer cell viability, proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Sodium TSIIA sulfate (STS) treatment inhibited the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell malignant phenotypes, which were reversed by the knockdown of RNF123. Mechanistically, TSIIA promoted KAT2B-mediated H3K18ac modification at the promoter region of the RNF123 gene, leading to upregulated RNF123 expression in NSCLC cells. Additionally, KAT2B knockdown prevented the STS-induced inhibition of NSCLC cell malignant phenotypes. Furthermore, RNF123 upregulation restored the effect of KAT2B knockdown on STS-treated NSCLC phenotypes. In conclusion, TSIIA inhibited the NSCLC cell malignant phenotypes via the epigenetic modification of RNF123."

Computational predictions, using a machine learning model trained on the human RCC TCGA dataset, and cell-based validations, confirmed BCL-X (L) dependence in all RCC subtypes. Remarkably, cell state changes, 'anoikis' programs, inflammatory state, and metabolic perturbations (e.g., fumarate production in FH-deficient RCCs) independently conferred increased BCL-X (L) dependence. Correlation studies revealed that increased AMPK isoform 2 ( PRKAA2 ) expression is a kidney-specific biomarker of BCL-X (L) dependence. Indeed, pharmacological AMPK activation sensitized RCCs to BCL-X (L) blockade. Finally, using functional studies, we developed a multivariate model that accurately predicted BCL-X (L) dependence in RCC. Our studies offer biomarkers for patient stratification and credential BCL-X (L) as a subtype agnostic vulnerability in difficult-to-treat RCCs."

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in American men, with African American/Black (AA/B) men experiencing higher incidence and mortality than European American (EA) men. Obesity, which disproportionately affects AA/B men, is linked to increased PCa mortality, potentially through metabolic dysregulation. We hypothesize that methylglyoxal (MG), a reactive byproduct of glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism that is elevated in obesity, contributes to PCa progression. MG forms covalent adducts on DNA, RNA, and protein. We found that MG-adducts are elevated in AA/B men with PCa compared to EA men with PCa, as well as men without PCa. AA/B men with PCa had a higher frequency of SNP rs1049346 in glyoxalase 1 (GLO1), the primary MG detoxification enzyme. PCa cell lines from EA (C4-2) and AA/B (MDA-PCa-2b) men showed differential rs1049346 status, with C4-2 cells heterozygous and MDA-PCa-2b cells homozygous for the variant. This was associated with altered GLO1 expression and activity, with MDA-PCa-2b cells exhibiting reduced GLO1 function and increased MG-adducts compared to C4-2 cells. MG altered DNA repair and RNA processing pathways and induced distinct metabolic shifts in MDA-PCa-2b compared to C4-2 cells, including increased glycolysis and reduced oxidative phosphorylation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed unique MG-induced stress responses including a tenfold higher induction of TXNIP in MDA-PCa-2b vs. C4-2 cells, a gene inversely linked to GLO1 expression and activity. These findings suggest that MG stress may contribute to PCa progression in AA/B men through metabolic reprogramming and impaired detoxification, offering insight into potential precision medicine applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Patients with obesity and diabetes have an elevated risk of cancer mortality. Defining how metabolic alterations contribute to this link is critical to understanding disease progression and identifying strategies to improve outcomes."

Here, we introduce the m echano M R m icroparticle (M (3) , \"M-cube\") sensor, a hybrid soft-matter/nanoparticle probe that integrates directly into tissue mechanical networks while transducing local stress into quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) readouts with single-particle resolution. We demonstrate the utility of this platform across diverse model systems, including tumor spheroids, Xenopus embryos, and mouse xenografts, where the M (3) sensor enables noninvasive, spatiotemporally resolved mapping of tissue stress dynamics during cancer development. Using this approach, we reveal that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is accompanied by distinctive stress-remodeling patterns observable in vivo . Strikingly, we find that abrupt stress increases, rather than cumulative or peak stress magnitude, are the key determinants of EMT induction in cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment. Transcriptomic profiling under controlled stress-loading dynamics shows that sustained yet gradual stress escalation activates cytoprotective antioxidation pathways (e.g., FOXO/AMPK) that reinforce epithelial stability, whereas acute stress surges overwhelm these defense mechanisms, predisposing cells toward mesenchymal reprogramming. These findings establish the M (3) sensor as a broadly applicable technology for linking dynamic mechanical cues to cell-state transitions in development, homeostasis, and disease."

    "abstract": "Complex neuronal circuits arise from a small set of cell-surface receptors that position neurons, promote axon extension, and define synaptic connections. A central receptor is Deleted in Colon Cancer (DCC), which mediates both short- and long-range axon guidance and confines migrating neurons to the central nervous system. DCC's versatility reflects its ability to interact at distinct sites of its extracellular domain with two ligands, Netrin-1 and Draxin, which also bind to each other. Alternative splicing further alters the Netrin-1 binding site and modulates affinity. By generating two mouse lines with mutations that selectively impair DCC binding to Netrin-1 and/or Draxin, we show that molecular modularity within the DCC extracellular domain is essential for precise circuit assembly. An eight-amino acid insertion in the DCC (long) isoform is required for Netrin-1-dependent long-range commissural axon guidance in the spinal cord. Conversely, isoleucine 372 in the Draxin binding site enables DCC clustering and is necessary for all known DCC functions, including axon guidance in the spinal cord and retina and neuronal migration in the brainstem. Draxin also supports long-range commissural guidance, but mutations in its binding site cause stronger defects. These results underscore how DCC's distinct modules drive specific developmental responses."

A central challenge is identifying ideal T-cell populations that effectively eliminate tumors without causing off-target damage, a distinction not captured by existing biomarkers. We show that co-expression patterns of chemokine receptors (CRs) CXCR3, CCR5, and CXCR6 on CD8 (+) T cells provide a functional \"code\" defining subsets with divergent roles in on-target immunity versus off-target inflammation. In mouse and human melanoma, a triple-positive (CXCR3 (+) CCR5 (+) CXCR6 (+) ) T-cell subset is essential for tumor control, and its genetic signature correlates with positive clinical response, while a distinct CCR5 (+) CXCR6 (+) subset drives liver immune-related adverse events (IRAEs). Crucially, this CR code reveals that immunotherapy actively reshapes T-cell trafficking patterns, uncovering profound heterogeneity within conventional populations and distinguishing potent anti-tumor progenitors from cells predisposed to exhaustion or off-target migration. This work establishes CR co-expression as a practical tool, providing a surface marker-based strategy to identify and enrich optimized T cells for adoptive therapies, thereby offering a framework to uncouple efficacy from toxicity."

To train and validate our model, we created PRISM-12M, a large-scale dataset comprising over twelve million spatially registered histology and spatial omics image patches across fourteen tissue types from humans and mice. TissueCraftAI significantly outperforms existing methods in generating realistic histology images and predicting spatial proteomics and transcriptomics data with high fidelity. We demonstrated its utility in various downstream applications, including improving cell type annotation and enhancing the accuracy of patient survival predictions across multiple cancer types.

Malignant pleural effusions (MPE) may represent a more accessible source of tumor-reactive T cells. Here, we characterize the cellular composition as well as the transcriptional and functional properties of T cells from MPE compared with pulmonary metastasis and blood from a patient with melanoma. METHODS: The immune cellular composition was immunophenotyped by high-dimensional flow cytometry from synchronously collected MPE, a lung metastasis, and blood from a patient with metastatic melanoma. Sorted CD3 (+) T cells were profiled by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq). TCR reactivity to autologous tumor was evaluated through in vitro activation assays with TCR-transduced Jurkat and autologous cancer cells. The killing capacity of ex vivo expanded T cells of autologous cancer cells was assessed through in vitro cytotoxicity assays. RESULTS: MPE had higher proportions of CD45 (+) immune cells and CD3 (+) T cells (70.5% vs 50%) compared with tumor and was enriched for effector CD8 (+) T cells, CCR7 (-) CD45RA (-) effector memory CD4 (+) T cells, and quiescent CD25 (high) CD127 (low) regulatory CD4 (+) T cells. MPE T cells exhibited lower levels of co-inhibitory receptors (PD-1, LAG-3, TIGIT, TIM-3) expression relative to tumor. ScRNA-seq showed enrichment of NK-like effector CD8 (+) T cells in MPE. Pseudotime analysis indicated that MPE T cells were less exhausted than tumor T cells. The clonal repertoire of MPE and tumor highly overlapped, including 62.2% of predicted neoantigen-specific (NeoTCR) clonotypes. Notably, clonally-related NeoTCR T cells in MPE exhibited higher cytotoxic and stemness, and lower exhaustion signatures compared with sister clones in the tumor. Two of four selected NeoTCR clonotypes transduced in Jurkat cells demonstrated MHC class I-restricted reactivity in co-culture with autologous cancer cells. MPE T cells also readily expanded in the presence of high-dose IL-2 and demonstrated MHC class I-dependent killing of autologous cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: MPE harbors polyclonal, tumor-reactive T cells with lower features of terminal exhaustion and higher cytotoxic potential relative to tumor T cells. MPE may therefore serve as a more accessible source for TIL therapy."

    "abstract": "Lethal toxins could become potent therapies against cancer, but their clinical utility is limited by adverse events upon systemic administration. These could be reduced if the toxins were delivered by effector cells that specifically infiltrate cancers, thereby releasing toxins locally into the tumor microenvironment. One of the challenges underlying this strategy is that cells delivering toxins would have to be resistant to them. We address this obstacle by showing that effectors derived from transformed human cell lines genetically engineered for resistance to bacterial adenosine diphosphate ribosylating toxins (ADPRTs), including Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PE), can produce targeted immunotoxins that specifically kill cancer cells expressing cognate tumor-associated antigens. Resistance to immunotoxins was achieved by knockout of genes in the diphthamide biosynthesis pathway ( DPH1-4 ) required for the posttranslational modification of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EEF2) that is the target of ADPRTs, or by mutation of EEF2 itself. We show that engineering resistance to ADPRTs, one of the most potent toxins acting on human cells, is essential to achieve robust function of armored effector cell lines. This work establishes a first step on the path to equip effector cells with the ability to deliver powerful toxins to cancer cells and introduces a platform to investigate extension to primary autologous or allogeneic therapeutic cell types."

Approximately 50% of HGSOCs are homologous recombination-proficient (HRP), and within this group, about 20% harbor CCNE1 amplification (cyclin E1-high). PARPi are especially ineffective in HRP tumors and in CCNE1 -high HGSOCs, which represent a major unmet clinical need. Loss of a chromatin remodeling enzyme, Amplified in Liver Cancer 1, ALC1, has been shown to enhance PARPi sensitivity. However, the clinical contexts in which ALC1 targeting will be clinically meaningful remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that ALC1 loss can enhance PARPi sensitivity across HRD and cyclin E1-high serous ovarian cancer lines, xenografts and patient-derived cells. ALC1 depletion can overcome several clinically relevant mechanisms of PARPi resistance, though its impact is limited in tumors with complete restoration of HR. Lower ALC1 expression correlates with longer progression-free survival and extended PARPi response. Importantly, ALC1 loss has minimal effects in BRCA -wild-type or BRCA -heterozygous non-cancerous fallopian tube cells, suggesting therapeutic safety. Increased PARPi sensitivity following ALC1 loss can be accurately predicted by endogenous single-stranded DNA levels, identifying a functional biomarker. Together, our studies define the clinical contexts in which the therapeutic utility of PARPi can be expanded by targeting ALC1, whose inhibitors are currently under evaluation in Phase I clinical trials."

    "abstract": "Invadopodia are actin- and protease-rich membrane structures present on metastatic cancer cells. We have previously shown that invadopodia-mediated ECM degradation is cell cycle-dependent. In mesenchymal human breast cancer cells, invadopodia degrade predominantly in G1 phase of the cell cycle. More recently, we have discovered that the hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) metastatic cells also have the ability to assemble invadopodia. Here, we investigated how different EMT states affect the cell cycle regulation of invadopodia and invasion of breast cancer cells. Starting with the Early E/M cell line 4T1, we used TGFbeta1 treatment to transition cells to a Late E/M state, or the induced Slug overexpression to achieve a fully mesenchymal (M) state, characterized by the complete loss of E-cadherin. We demonstrated that in Early E/M cells, invadopodia-mediated ECM degradation and invasion occur predominantly during the G2 phase, while Late E/M preferentially degrade ECM and invade during the G1, similarly to M cells. Moreover, when E cells are treated with TGFbeta1, they transition to Early E/M state and degrade in G2 phase. To identify invadopodia components responsible for EMT- and cell cycle-dependent ECM degradation, we performed bulk mRNA sequencing of Early-versus Late-E/M cells in G1-or G2-phase of the cell cycle. The top candidate of our RNASeq analysis, FILIP1L, was expressed at significantly higher levels during G2 phase in Early E/M cells and during G1 phase in Late E/M cells, matching the invasive phase of each cell population. Expression of FILIP1L is upregulated in cells transitioning from E/M to M state. We next demonstrate FILIP1L is a novel invadopodia component, which colocalizes with Tks5 and cortactin. In the absence of FILIP1L expression, ECM degradation is significantly increased. Meanwhile, cell migration is significantly decreased, resulting in an overall decrease in the 3D spheroid invasion. Finally, we demonstrate that the high expression of FILIP1L is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. In summary, FILIP1L is a novel invadopodia component which regulates breast cancer invasion and tumor progression in a cell cycle- and EMT-dependent manner by controlling invadopodia and motility of cancer cells."

    "abstract": "Cancer driver mutations alone are often insufficient to fully explain tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that these mutations cooperate with somatic copy number variations (CNVs) in a tissue-specific pattern of genomic epistasis. Analyzing 93,462 tumors, we identified 54 gene-cancer type pairs with significant co-occurrence of somatic mutations and CNVs. Our new Binoculars algorithm, which resolved phased DNA/RNA reads, revealed frequent preferential amplification in oncogenic mutation alleles, including AKT1 p.E17K, BRAF p.V600E, KRAS p.G12C/D/V, NRAS p.Q61K, and a fraction of gain-of-function TP53 p.R175H. Conversely, deletions selectively targeted the reference alleles, leading to loss of heterozygosity of IDH1 p.R132H and tumor suppressor mutations, including CDKN2A and TP53 truncations. Lung cancer patients carrying co-occurrences of somatic mutation-CNVs in TP53 and KRAS showed poorer survival than those carrying the same gene mutations. These findings reveal epistasis of cancer mutations and CNVs at an allelic resolution, suggesting specific genomic events to enhance patient stratification and therapeutic targeting."

However, the impact of gut microbes on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression and response to immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) remains unclear due to the lack of combined preclinical and clinical studies. APPROACH & RESULTS: We performed 16S rRNA of cross-cohort stool samples from 10 HCC responders (R) and 40 non-responders (NR) to ICB at baseline and on-treatment time-points. We identified an enrichment of Bacteroidetes in NR. To study the role of the microbiome in the cancer immune response, we generated an immunogenic mouse model of HCC via hydrodynamic tail-vein injection (HDTVI) of DNA plasmids mimicking common HCC alterations and immunogenicity by expressing model antigens ( MYC-lucOS;CTNNB1 tumors). We found that antibiotic (ABX)-induced dysbiosis promoted a pro-tumorigenic effect in the MYC-lucOS;CTNNB1 HCC model by the expansion of a specific Bacteroidetes , Parabacteroides distasonis . Colonization of mice carrying MYC-lucOS;CTNNB1 HCCs with Parabacteroides distasonis confirmed its pro-tumorigenic effect in vivo. Furthermore, we explored the effects of colonizing with microbiotas from patients and showed that microbiota from a NR donor enriched in Bacteroidetes promoted faster tumorigenesis than microbiota from a R donor with reduced Bacteroidetes . We isolated 6 Bacteroidetes species from the NR donor, cultured them, and used them as a cocktail to colonize mice; similarly, mice transplanted with this cocktail showed increased tumorigenesis and reduced survival. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified Bacteroidetes enrichment as a potential biomarker of ICB resistance in HCC and, by using immunogenic mouse models, established that Bacteroidetes abundance influences tumor development."

    "abstract": "Among prostate cancer patients, co-morbid Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is associated with faster progression to biochemical recurrence and increased risk of mortality. Previous work from our lab provides evidence that exosomes purified from media of insulin resistant adipocytes or T2D patient plasma likely drives these outcomes by delivering miRNAs that exacerbate tumor aggressiveness in several breast and prostate cancer models. Here, we build on our previous findings to investigate whether treatment with metabolic medications attenuates the tumor promoting effects of exosomes. We found that human DU145 cells, a model for prostate cancer, treated with plasma exosomes from T2D patients, shows patterns in global gene transcription that resolve by patient treatment with metformin. To test the effects of metformin experimentally, we used a murine model of insulin resistance (IR). Treating DU145 cells with miRNAs purified from the plasma exosomes of IR mice, we found that cells transfected with miRNAs from the metformin-treated IR group displayed significantly less migration than cells transfected with miRNAs from the unmedicated IR group. We suggest that metformin may partially reverse effects of T2D to exacerbate tumor aggressiveness by modifying the miRNA payload of plasma exosomes."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ewing sarcoma (EwS) is a highly aggressive cancer driven by the EWS::FLI1 fusion oncoprotein affecting children, adolescents, and young adults. Six transmembrane epithelial antigen 1 (STEAP1) is a cell surface antigen transcriptionally controlled by EWS::FLI1 that is broadly expressed in EwS, positioning it as a rational immunotherapy target. However, translating CAR T therapy to solid tumors requires overcoming barriers to potency while maintaining safety. METHODS: Analyses of transcriptome and proteome data were performed to evaluate the effects of EWS::FLI1 perturbation on STEAP1 expression at the transcript and protein levels in EwS models. STEAP1 expression was validated in EwS patient tissues by immunohistochemistry. Second-generation STEAP1-BBzeta CAR T cells were tested in orthotopic and disseminated EwS xenograft models. To enhance antitumor activity, an IL-18-armored STEAP1 CAR was engineered. Dose-dependent therapeutic efficacy and safety were evaluated through measurement of tumor burden, survival, and observation for gross toxicities. RESULTS: STEAP1 was expressed in  approximately 97% of primary EwS tumors and directly associated with EWS::FLI1 fusion protein expression in EwS cell lines. In orthotopic EwS models, STEAP1 CAR T cells induced complete tumor regression at 5 x 10 (6) cells. In disseminated disease models, responses were dose-dependent with no evidence of antigen loss. Notably, IL-18 armored STEAP1 CAR T cells achieved complete responses in  approximately 80% of mice at a reduced dose of 10 (6) cells without overt toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These data establish STEAP1 as a clinically relevant and highly expressed target in EwS and demonstrate that IL-18 armoring significantly improves CAR T cell efficacy by enhancing potency evident through antitumor activity at reduced cell dose. STEAP1 CAR T cells are currently under evaluation in a first-in-human phase 1/2 dose-escalation clinical trial for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( NCT06236139 ) and these studies support future clinical translation of STEAP1 CAR T cell therapy for relapsed/refractory EwS."

    "abstract": "Manufacturing clinical grade mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) remains a major bottleneck for cell-based therapies, as extensive in-vitro expansion on standard tissue-culture plastic (TCP) drives loss of stemness, reduced immunomodulatory activity, and diminished therapeutic efficacy. Although substrate stiffness is known to influence MSC fate through mechanotransduction, the epigenetic mechanisms linking mechanical stress to progressive phenotypic drift remain poorly defined. A mechano-epigenetic pathway is identified in this work, centered on the histone methyltransferase EZH2 - that governs chromatin remodeling and loss of stemness during serial passaging. Multi-omics, high-resolution imaging, and functional assays show that MSCs expanded on mechanically stiff TCP accumulate H3K27me3 repressive chromatin mark, lose SWI/SNF -ARID1A chromatin- remodeling foci, and exhibit an altered chromatin accessibility profile. Pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 with GSK343 selectively reduced H3K27me3, restored ARID1A-containing SWI/SNF organization, and preserved MSC morphology and expression of canonical stemness markers (CD73, CD90, CD105) even at later passage. ATAC-seq analysis revealed that GSK343 rebalanced chromatin accessibility, reopening TEAD/YAP-responsive regulatory regions while repressing accessibility at lineage- priming and senescence-associated sites. RNA-seq demonstrated that GSK343 maintained transcriptional programs associated with immunomodulation, migration, and trophic signaling, while suppressing hyperproliferative and senescence-associated genes that are characteristic of late-passage MSCs. Proteomic profiling of MSC secretomes further showed that GSK343 attenuated pro-fibrotic ECM factors and senescence- linked proteins while enhancing angiogenic and reparative mediators. Functionally, conditioned media from GSK343-treated MSCs significantly increased primary chondrocyte proliferation, demonstrating preserved therapeutic potency. Together, these findings establish EZH2 as a central mediator of stiffness-induced epigenetic drift in human MSCs and demonstrate that EZH2 inhibition can maintain the stemness without compromising their expansion ability. This work provides a foundational strategy for mechano-epigenetic engineering of MSCs and highlights EZH2 inhibition as a scalable, manufacturing-compatible approach to preserve potency for regenerative medicine applications. SIGNIFIANCE STATEMENT: Primary mesenchymal stem/ stromal cells (MSC) derived from bone marrow are currently under numerous clinical trials for regenerative medicine and cancer treatment. Despite showing tremendous potential for their differentiation, trophic and immunomodulatory properties, their efficacy in clinical endpoint is limited. The traditional cell culture condition in cell culture flask limits their clinical translation by changing the MSC phenotype with serial passaging, a critical step required for harvesting a clinically appropriate number of cells. This work discovered the precise epigenetic mechanism involving histone methylation responsible for such changes in MSC phenotype. By inhibiting the histone methylation by GSK343, this study showed that MSC phenotype can be maintained over serial passaging as demonstrated by microscopy, multi-omics, and in vitro functional assays."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To analyze the temporal trends and turning points of thyroid cancer burden in China from 1990 to 2021 and project future incidence and mortality to 2035. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Data were sourced from the Global Burden of Disease 2021 database. METHODS: Temporal trends were evaluated using Joinpoint regression, and associations between cancer burden and sociodemographic indices were explored through frontier analysis. A Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort model was applied to project future disease burden through 2035. RESULTS: In 2021, China reported 48,104 new thyroid cancer cases and 7692 deaths. From 1990 to 2021, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and prevalence rate (ASPR) increased markedly (average annual percentage change [AAPC]: 2.98% and 2.25%, respectively), whereas the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and disability-adjusted life year rate (ASDR) declined (AAPC: -0.65% and -0.56%). A pivotal shift occurred around 2005: while ASMR and ASDR continued to decrease in both China and globally, China's ASIR and ASPR accelerated further, contrasting with a global deceleration. Projections indicate that China's ASIR for thyroid cancer is expected to increase more rapidly than the global average over the next 15 years. CONCLUSION: The thyroid cancer burden in China is characterized by rapidly rising incidence and stagnating mortality decline, a pattern distinct from global trends and likely driven by intensified detection. This escalating burden necessitates public health strategies focused on optimizing screening practices and managing overdiagnosis."

    "abstract": "Many breast cancer survivors are prescribed daily oral medications called endocrine therapy that prevent cancer recurrence. Despite its clinical importance, maintaining consistent daily adherence remains challenging due to the dynamic and interrelated influences of behavioral, physiological, and psychological factors. While prior studies have explored adherence prediction using mobile sensing, they often rely on single-modality data, limited temporal granularity, or aggregate-level modeling-limiting their ability to capture short and long-term behavioral variability and to facilitate deeper understanding of non-adherence and tailored interventions. To address these gaps, we propose a multimodal sensing framework that explicitly models daily adherence dynamics using temporally adaptive inputs. We recruited a sample of breast cancer survivors (N = 20) and collected longitudinal data streams including wearable-derived physiological features (Fitbit), medication event monitoring system (MEMS) data, and ecological momentary assessments (EMAs). Using multimodal data across varying time windows, we examined whether recent patterns in behavioral, physiological, psychological, and environmental factors improve the prediction of next-day endocrine therapy adherence. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using multimodal sensing data to predict daily adherence with moderate accuracy. Moreover, models integrating multimodal data consistently outperformed those relying on a single modality. Importantly, we observed that the predictive value of each modality varied depending on the temporal proximity of the input signals, underscoring the importance of modeling immediate and longer-term behavioral patterns. The findings offer valuable insights for advancing adherence monitoring systems, suggesting that incorporating personalized and temporally adaptive data fusion strategies may significantly enhance the effectiveness of intervention design and delivery."

    "abstract": "Oxidative DNA damage is a major driver of genome instability and human disease. Among the various types of oxidative DNA base lesions, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8oxoG) is particularly prevalent due to guanine's low oxidation potential and the abundance of guanine-rich (G-rich) sequences across the genome. Structure-forming repeat sequences, which are commonly G-rich, can adopt alternative DNA secondary structures that further expose nucleobases to oxidative damage. The base excision repair (BER) pathway is primarily responsible for the repair of 8oxoG lesions; however, the complex topologies and dynamic conformations formed by these repeat sequences present challenges for complete repair. Inefficient BER within these structures can lead to DNA strand breaks, mutations, and large chromosomal rearrangements, all of which are associated with human disease. Notably, structure-forming repeat sequences are often enriched at regulatory genomic regions, where BER can directly influence processes such as replication and transcription. This review summarizes current insights into BER activity within oxidatively damaged structure-forming repeat sequences and highlights how repair efficiency within these sequences impacts genome stability and disease."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: CD47 is a \"don't eat me\" signal that is overexpressed in tumors to evade phagocytosis by tumor associated macrophages (TAM). Investigational agents targeting CD47, such as magrolimab, aim to induce phagocytosis of tumor cells by TAMs. Previously, two key TAM subsets have been identified: C1QC TAMs, which display pro-phagocytic activity, and SPP1 TAMs that express pro-angiogenic markers. We characterize CD47 expression and its relationship with tumor macrophages in solid tumor samples. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Resectable tumors from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (n=36) (HNSCC), breast cancer (n=37) (BC), and colorectal cancer (n=36) (CRC) were evaluated for CD47 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), two multiplex immunofluorescence panels were used to characterize TAM markers and T cell markers. RNA sequencing was also performed. RESULTS: CD47 protein expression was higher on tumor cells compared to stromal cells across tumor indications tested. Although CRC had the lowest prevalence for CD47 expression in primary tumors, we observed a marked increase in CD47 expression in CRC liver metastases. We developed an SPP1 TAM gene signature and validated a C1QC TAM gene signature to estimate TAM abundances from bulk RNA-Seq data. In the TAM mIF analysis, HNSCC had the highest macrophage density of the indications tested. We observed a positive correlation between a higher C1QC: SPP1 TAM ratio and macrophage phenotype and tumor T cell density. C1QC macrophage signatures correlate with tumor CD47 protein expression in BC and HNSCC samples, suggesting interplay between them. CONCLUSIONS: We characterized CD47 expression across key solid tumor indications being evaluated clinically using anti-CD47 blockade agents: HNSCC, breast cancer and CRC. Using a CD47 IHC assay, we identified HNSCC as an indication with the highest CD47 expression. In addition, we quantified tumor macrophages using multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) and determined that HNSCC had the highest density of TAMs. Compared to relatively low CD47 expression in primary CRC tumors, CRC liver metastases had very high CD47 expression. Quantification of TAM signatures and CD47 expression represent key biomarkers to monitor in patient samples during exploration of CD47-blockade agents in the clinic."

It provides a detailed analysis of the origin, differentiation pathways, and dynamic plasticity of exhausted T cells, revealing the possibility of functional recovery under specific conditions. At the same time, the article analyzes the profound influence of various factors in the TME (such as metabolic stress, immune suppression networks, and stromal interaction interfaces) on the process of T cell exhaustion. It conducts in-depth research on the molecular characteristics of exhausted T cells (including surface marker characteristics, transcriptional regulatory networks, and metabolic reprogramming characteristics), providing potential therapeutic targets for precision medicine.

We investigated whether ascitic T-cell phenotypes, integrated with clinical variables, improve prediction of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), progression-free interval (PFI), and platinum-based drug chemotherapy resistance (P-DCR). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 87 patients with FIGO III/IV HGSOC with treatment-naive ascites treated at Peking University Third Hospital (May 2019-Mar 2024; median follow-up, 33 months). Ascites (>1,000 mL) underwent standardized processing and multiparametric flow cytometry to quantify T-cell subsets. To prevent information leakage, we used repeated nested cross-validation with event-stratified folds: inner folds performed endpoint-specific screening with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control, redundancy reduction, and multicollinearity checks; clinical covariates were added by incremental contribution testing. Cox proportional hazards, Random Survival Forests (RSFs), and DeepSurv modeled survival endpoints; a random-forest classifier modeled P-DCR. Performance was summarized on outer folds [C-index for survival; receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve (ROC-AUC) for P-DCR]. Model interpretability used Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). RESULTS: Across endpoints, combined clinical + ascites features outperformed single-source features, with RSF consistently best. Outer-fold testing C-indices for RSF with combined features were 0.72 (OS), 0.70 (PFS), and 0.74 (PFI). The P-DCR classifier achieved a mean AUC of 0.69 with combined features (accuracy, 0.66; sensitivity, 0.70; specificity, 0.62). Feature-count sensitivity analyses showed performance gains plateauing at modest k ( approximately 5-7). Kaplan-Meier curves derived from combined-feature risk scores demonstrated clear stratification. SHAP analyses indicated protective effects of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor maintenance across endpoints, while ascitic T-cell subsets, including PD-1(+)CD57(+)CD4(+) and CCR7(-)CD45RA(+)CD4(+) populations, were repeatedly associated with higher risk; age contributed strongly to PFI. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating ascitic immunophenotyping with clinical factors improves risk prediction in HGSOC, with RSF offering robust performance under rigorous, leakage-safe validation. Ascites-resident T-cell states provide complementary, reproducible prognostic signals for survival and platinum response, supporting their potential utility for patient stratification and hypothesis generation for immunomodulatory strategies."

METHODS: This observational prospective study was conducted using the clinical data of 34 patients with NSCLC and BM, including 24 patients who received immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic therapy and 10 control patients using oral anlotinib upon the first- to fourth-line treatment failure or refusing to continue chemotherapy between June 2017 and August 2022. Efficacy was evaluated using progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and adverse reactions. RESULTS: Among 24 patients treated with immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic therapy, 17 had a partial response, six had stable disease, and one had progressive disease. The ORR and DCR of patients receiving immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic therapy were 70.8% and 95.8%, respectively. The median PFS of immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic treatment was significantly longer than that of oral anlotinib (18.0 vs. 4 months, log-rank test, p < 0.0001), indicating that immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic therapy can substantially improve the treatment efficacy for NSCLC with BM and negative driver genes. Adverse reactions mainly included rash in one case and hypothyroidism in one case, but did not involve myocardial damage or liver and kidney function damage.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between mitochondrial function-related genes and BC progression. METHODS: We identified BC differentially expressed genes via the GEO database, constructed a weighted co-expression network to determine BC pathogenesis-related key modules. Using 113 machine learning algorithms and MitoCarta mitochondrial genetics data, we developed a mitochondrial gene-based diagnostic model. GO/KEGG enrichment analyses delineated BC-related biological processes of mitochondrial genes, offering clues for understanding BC mechanism. High-throughput tissue chip and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) validated key genes' local expression in tissues. CiberSort immune infiltration analysis highlighted NK and T cells' role in BC; single-cell analysis identified gene expression patterns across tumor microenvironment cell types. Computational drug prediction and molecular docking explored targeted therapeutic candidates. Additionally, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations. RESULTS: The glmBoost+LDA model had the highest C-index (0.947) in the validated cohort, including 18 potential BC biomarkers (e.g., ACADS, AUC = 0.810; AIFM2, AUC = 0.806). The results of experimental validation showed that the expression score of ACADS in cancerous tissues was significantly lower than that in adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Immune infiltration and single-cell analyses emphasized the crucial roles of NK cells and T cells in BC. Disulfiram and eugenol were predicted as potential therapeutics and validated by docking. Molecular dynamics simulations validated that Eugenol exhibits strong binding interactions with the target proteins AIFM2 and ACADS. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies mitochondrial gene signatures associated with BC and proposes a computational model distinguishing tumor from normal tissue. These findings offer potential leads for future biomarker development but require additional clinical and functional validation."

We elucidated the cell type-specific transcriptome landscape of cancer cells and the effect of the TME on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing of the LUAD tissues and matched adjacent normal tissues of three patients in the early-stage via histopathological and immunohistochemical confirmation. RESULTS: The results revealed the landscape of 68,579 cells in LUAD microenvironment, and highly heterogeneous AT2 cells are crucial source of lung epithelial cell carcinogenesis. Genes KRT81, SPP1, PCDH7, SLC2A1, and TET1 were significantly upregulated in tumor tissues and associated with poor prognosis and survival, providing insights for exploring lung cancer biomarkers in future studies. Trajectory analysis identified ERBB4, SEMA4A, GCNT2 and SOX4 as key factors in AT2 cells that may promote cell proliferation, migration, or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during the progression of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We elucidated the transcription factor-target gene regulatory network involving NKX2-1 and TEAD1 in malignant tumor cells derived from AT2 cells. The findings indicated that malignant AT2 cells regulate communication between epithelial and immune cells in the TME by predicted FN1-CD44 and CADM1-CADM1 ligand-receptor interactions, which ultimately suppresses the host immune response. DISCUSSION: This comprehensive single-cell analysis increases our understanding of AT2 cells molecular and dynamics of metastatic lung cancer. In summary, single-cell RNA profiling of LUAD offers valuable prognostic insights based on AT2 cell types and identifies potential biomarkers for therapeutic responses, aiding the future development of LUAD treatment strategies."

Platinum-based chemotherapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is now the first-line treatment for extensive-stage disease (ES-SCLC), extending the overall survival (OS) period of these patients by 2-5 months, yet durable remissions remain the privilege of fewer than 20% of patients. Despite intensive investigation, this incremental benefit appears to have plateaued, prompting exploration of alternative combination strategies to unleash deeper and more durable antitumor synergy. Recent phase II/III trials integrating anti-angiogenic agents into the chemo-immunotherapy have reported unprecedented OS gains of up to 7 months, redefining therapeutic expectations. Concurrently, chemoradiation with ICIs triplet regimens have demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity in ES-SCLC, while rational combinations of small-molecule targeted drugs (DLL3 inhibitors, PARP inhibitors) combined with ICIs or epigenetic modifiers with ICIs are yielding early signals of efficacy. Nevertheless, primary resistance, absence of robust predictive biomarkers, and cumulative toxicity continue to curtail clinical impact. This Review provides a comprehensive, evidence-based map of the evolving ES-SCLC immunotherapy combination landscape. We critically dissect competing therapeutic paradigms, juxtapose corroborative and contradictory data, and distill actionable insights for future trial design, biomarker development, and regulatory strategy."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer poses a severe threat owing to its high morbidity and mortality rates, which are largely attributed to drug resistance. Therefore, novel therapeutic targets need to be identified. Pyroptosis is an inflammatory cell death process mediated by gasdermin (GSDM) and dependent on caspases. Moreover, pyroptosis plays a role in regulating tumor progression and response to therapy. Furthermore, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) is a glucose analogue that confers anticancer effects via metabolic interference. However, its mechanism of action in breast cancer remains unclear. METHODS: To explore the effect of 2-DG on pyroptosis in EMT6/4T1 breast cancer cells, cell viability assays, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation, and morphological analyses were performed. For in vivo studies, antitumor effects of 2-DG were assessed using xenograft models, and its safety was evaluated by monitoring body weight and conducting histological analysis. RESULTS: 2-DG induced cytotoxicity and pyroptosis in EMT6/4T1 breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, 2-DG activated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) signalling, suppressed hexokinase 2 (HK2), and triggered caspase-3/GSDME-dependent pyroptosis. In vivo experiments demonstrated that 2-DG inhibited breast tumor growth without causing severe toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings identified a novel metabolic-inflammatory axis (cAMP/PKA-HK2-caspase-3/GSDME) in breast cancer. Furthermore, study highlights the in vivo efficacy and safety of 2-DG and its ability to induce pyroptosis, thereby providing a basis for targeting drug resistance in breast cancer."

    "abstract": "The circadian clock exerts profound regulatory control over adaptive immunity, particularly affecting T and B lymphocyte development, trafficking, activation, and effector function. These immune cells possess autonomous molecular clocks governed by core genes such as Bmal1, Clock, Per1/2, and Cry1/2, which influence transcriptional programs related to receptor expression, cytokine signaling, and metabolism. Circadian regulation shapes the daily oscillation of lymphocyte recirculation through lymphoid organs, modulates antigen responsiveness, and fine-tunes subset differentiation-most notably skewing CD4(+) T cell fate toward Th1, Th2, Th17, or Treg lineages depending on time-of-day-linked signaling cascades such as mTOR/Akt and RORgammat/Nfil3 pathways. Similarly, rhythmic glucocorticoid and catecholamine signaling synchronize peripheral lymphocyte clocks with systemic cues, integrating hormonal and environmental information. Clinically, circadian disruption - whether through genetic mutations, shift work, or chronic stress - has been linked to aberrant lymphocyte function, increased autoimmunity, impaired vaccine responses, and reduced immunosurveillance in cancer. Recent findings demonstrate that time-of-day-dependent administration of vaccines and immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitors, can significantly influence clinical efficacy and immune outcomes. Understanding the temporal orchestration of adaptive immunity thus holds translational potential for optimizing therapeutic strategies, including chronotherapy and vaccination scheduling."

Among them, Other-1_19-tRNA-SeC-TCA-1 and Other-36_54-tRNA-Met-CAT-2-M4 exhibited excellent diagnostic performance, with areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of 0.9557 and 0.9773, respectively. Functional analyses revealed that differentially expressed tsRNAs were primarily involved in regulating signaling pathways such as TGF-beta, PI3K-Akt, and AMPK, and were closely associated with thyroid hormone metabolism. Elevated expression of Other-22_52-tRNA-Gly-GCC-1-M3 was significantly correlated with renal insufficiency (p < 0.05), suggesting its potential as a novel biomarker for assessing renal injury risk. The tsRNA-mRNA regulatory network comprised 11,141 interaction edges and exhibited a power-law topology, with the hub gene SRSF10 mediating coordinated regulation across multiple pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal a distinct imbalance in tsRNA expression in MM, indicating that specific tsRNA fragments contribute to disease progression and renal injury through multifaceted signaling networks, thereby providing novel molecular insights for early diagnosis and risk stratification."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Solid cancer patients are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 and may benefit from repeated booster doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. Beyond neutralizing antibody titers, recent evidence highlights the induction of spike-specific IgG4 after multiple vaccine doses, a phenomenon potentially linked to immune tolerance. METHODS: We investigated the humoral response following the administration of the fourth and fifth dose of the Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 mRNA vaccine in 48 patients with solid tumors undergoing active or recent anticancer treatment, compared with age-matched controls (n=24). Serum samples were collected before (T1) and three weeks after vaccination (T2). IgG against the spike receptor-binding-domain (IgG-RBD-S), spike-specific IgM (IgM-S), and IgG4 (IgG4-S) were quantified using standardized assays. RESULTS: Booster vaccination induced a robust increase in neutralizing IgG-RBD-S, with a median 4.6-fold rise at T2 (9568.9 vs. 2086.4 BAU/mL). Notably, high baseline titers at T1 confirmed antibody persistence at about one year after the third dose. IgG-RBD-S levels were higher in patients receiving the fifth compared to the fourth dose, supporting a cumulative dose-dependent effect. IgM-S positivity correlated with significantly stronger neutralizing responses. IgG4-S significantly increased post-vaccination (8.7 to 28.3 ng/mL), but no differences were observed between cancer patients and controls, nor between the fourth and fifth dose, suggesting a lack of further IgG4 accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated booster doses elicit strong and durable neutralizing antibody responses in solid cancer patients. It seems that variant-adapted formulations may mitigate IgG4 accumulation, thus ideally moderating tolerance associated with IgG4 by introducing antigenic novelty. These findings support continued booster administration and monitoring of humoral responses in oncologic populations."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: With the increasing application of high-throughput transcriptomic data in cancer research, identifying reliable cancer biomarkers in high-dimensional settings remains a major challenge. This study aims to systematically evaluate various regularized conditional logistic regression (CLR) methods under a matched case-control (MCC) design, focusing on their performance in variable selection, parameter estimation, and predictive accuracy. Special emphasis is placed on the importance of the matching design in reducing confounding effects and improving model interpretability. METHODS: We utilize RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), specifically datasets for liver, thyroid, and lung cancers, which include paired tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples. In our analysis, we apply 4 regularized CLR methods implemented in R packages-namely \"clogitL1,\" \"pclogit,\" \"clogitLasso,\" and \"penalizedclr\"-to analyze over 20 000 gene expression features. We evaluate the comparative performance of these methods based on metrics such as gene selection stability, predictive accuracy, and interpretability. Additionally, we employ a bootstrap resampling framework to estimate gene selection probabilities, which serve as a measure of gene importance. RESULTS: Our results show that incorporating the MCC design significantly enhances feature selection performance by mitigating confounding noise. The regularized CLR models successfully identify several well-established cancer-related genes with high selection consistency and statistical significance. In contrast, models that ignore the matched design tend to miss critical biomarkers or produce excessive false positives, leading to potentially misleading interpretations. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the value of integrating a matched case-control design with regularized CLR methods for the analysis of high-dimensional transcriptomic data. The proposed analytical framework offers improved accuracy, robustness, and biological relevance, providing a practical and scalable approach for cancer genomics research. It also supports the advancement of precision medicine and translational applications."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While e-health innovations have advanced cancer-care delivery in high-income countries, middle-income countries (MICs) face distinct systemic, infrastructural, and sociocultural challenges in adopting and scaling digital-health interventions. There is a growing imperative to explore how holistic digital platforms can be implemented effectively in oncology within resource-constrained settings. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the barriers and facilitators influencing the scalability and adoption of a comprehensive e-health solution in cancer care, drawing on a realist paradigm to determine what works, for whom, and under which circumstances, in the context of Jordan. METHODS: A qualitative study, underpinned by a realist paradigm, was conducted using in-depth, semi-structured interviews with oncology healthcare professionals from diverse clinical settings in Jordan. Interviews were conducted in Arabic, translated into English, and analyzed using a hybrid inductive-deductive framework approach. The Implementation of Change Model guided interpretation of the findings, enabling the identification of multi-level contextual influences. RESULTS: The analysis yielded a central theme-Facilitators and Barriers to Implementing a Holistic e-health Solution-comprising six deductive subthemes derived from the Implementation of Change Model: (A) Innovation; (B) Patients; (C) Healthcare professionals; (D) Organizational context; (E) Social context; and (F) Economic and political context. Across these subthemes, interpretive codes were classified as barriers or facilitators. Participants emphasized the necessity of assessing e-health readiness prior to implementation, and the importance of integrated, cross-sectoral approaches to support scalable, sustainable solutions. CONCLUSION: This study provides novel, contextually grounded insights into the implementation dynamics of digital transformation in oncology within MICs. It offers actionable guidance for policymakers and system designers aiming to foster sustainable, equitable digital-health ecosystems."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Global cancer is rising, and many survivors struggle to stay active despite clear health benefits. Mobile health tools can help with tracking and guidance, but users' real needs and barriers are unclear. This qualitative metasynthesis summarizes what survivors want, what helps, and what gets in the way. METHODS: We systematically searched CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, CBM, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL from inception to April 2025. Qualitative studies (or qualitative components of mixed-methods studies) exploring survivors' experiences with mHealth-supported PA were eligible. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and appraised methodological quality using the JBI qualitative checklist (2016). Findings were integrated via meta-synthesis, and confidence in synthesized findings was graded with the ConQual approach. Reporting followed ENTREQ. RESULTS: Twelve qualitative studies (n = 243 participants; 8 countries) were included. Fifty findings were aggregated into 11 categories and synthesized into 3 higher-order findings: (1) survivors have multidimensional needs regarding content tailoring, professional input, social features, and usable design; (2) mHealth can strengthen motivation, self-efficacy, and convenience for engaging in PA; and (3) participation is shaped by patient-related, technology-related, and economic factors. CONCLUSION: Addressing survivors' motivations, lived experiences, and practical barriers-through personalization, professional guidance, privacy-preserving social support, and robust technical design-may enhance adoption and sustained use of mHealth for PA in cancer survivorship.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Benefits of ultrasound in breast cancer detection are often limited by the similar appearance of complicated cysts and solid hypoechoic masses with B-mode imaging, which can lead to false positive diagnoses. PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) on short-lag spatial coherence (SLSC) ultrasound images as an objective tool to improve complicated cyst vs solid mass classification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this secondary analysis of a prospective recruitment for the Advanced Ultrasound Signal Processing of Suspicious Breast Images (AUSPICIOUS) observational study (NCT07206888), women scheduled for ultrasound-guided procedures or follow-up of at least 1 breast mass were enrolled from March 2018 to October 2023. Raw ultrasound data were acquired with an Alpinion ECUBE12R research scanner, then post-processed with our custom software. The primary evaluation indicator was gCNR applied to SLSC images with regions of interest determined by 6 radiologists. Outcomes were compared to the same radiologists classifying mass contents as solid, fluid, mixed, or uncertain using B-mode images. The reference standard was determined by aspiration, pathology, or characterization of image features. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and inter-reader agreement (Fleiss' kappa) were assessed. RESULTS: Among 175 cases, 145 breast masses from 115 women (age: 52 +/- 17 years) were analyzed, including 16 complicated cysts and 96 solid masses. The mean AUC for complicated cyst vs solid mass characterization was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94, 0.97) with gCNR applied to SLSC images, relative to a mean lower-bound AUC of 0.67 (range: 0.54-0.76) with readings of B-mode images (P < .05). Inter-reader agreement improved from fair with B-mode (kappa  =  0.40) to moderate with gCNR applied to SLSC images with a 0.76 threshold (kappa  =  0.59, P < .00001). CONCLUSION: Applying an objective gCNR metric to SLSC images improved the differentiation of complicated cysts from solid masses when compared to subjective readings of B-mode images."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ischemic stroke has well-established risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. However, strokes can also occur in the context of less common etiologies such as malignancies, particularly as certain malignancies are associated with hypercoagulable states. Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a malignancy that can present with a hypercortisolemic state, which can further exacerbate cancer coagulopathy and the traditional metabolic risk factors of stroke. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old woman presented with expressive aphasia and was found to have multifocal acute infarcts on magnetic resonance imaging. She underwent a thorough cardiac, coagulopathy, and paraneoplastic workup and was found to have a right adrenal mass and was biochemically hypercortisolemic. The patient underwent surgical resection of the adrenal mass and pathology confirmed the diagnosis of ACC. CONCLUSION: The discovery of this rare malignancy underscores the complex interplay between malignancy, hormonal imbalances, hypercoagulability in stroke and the importance of a comprehensive clinical diagnostic evaluation."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In recent years, growing attention has been paid to the carcinogenicity of endocrine disruptors (EDs). However, their relationship with prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear. This study investigates the association between EDs and PCa to identify key genes that may bridge this relationship. METHODS: The ADME properties and carcinogenicity of the selected endocrine-disrupting chemicals EDs were predicted using the ADMETlab 3.0 and ProTox 3.0 platforms, respectively. Potential target genes related to EDs and PCa were obtained by integrating multiple public databases. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the overlapping genes was constructed and visualized, followed by GO and KEGG enrichment analyses to explore their potential biological mechanisms. From 101 machine learning algorithm combinations, the most relevant key genes for PCa progression were screened. Molecular docking analysis was used to evaluate the binding properties between ED compounds and key targets. Pan-cancer analysis was employed to examine the general role of key genes across multiple cancer types. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) was used to identify natural active products potentially targeting the core genes. Finally, in vitro cell experiments were conducted to validate the effects of EDs on PCa cells and the intervention effects of related natural products. RESULTS: Initially, predictions from the ADMETlab 3.0 and ProTox 3.0 platforms indicated significant in vivo accumulation, endocrine-disrupting effects, and carcinogenicity for the 12 common EDs. Subsequently, the integration of multiple databases identified 233 overlapping targets associated with PCa. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that these targets are primarily involved in regulating cell proliferation, inflammatory responses, and cancer cell metabolism. Among the evaluated machine learning algorithms, the CoxBoost + SuperPC hybrid model demonstrated superior predictive performance and robustness. Subsequent analysis pinpointed three key regulatory genes: CD38, MMP11, and PLK1. Molecular docking simulations confirmed potential interactions between EDs compounds and the core target, PLK1. Furthermore, five natural active products were identified as potential agents to mitigate the adverse effects induced by EDs exposure. Finally, in vitro cell experiments demonstrated that Benzo[a]pyrene promotes PLK1 expression and PCa progression, whereas Cryptotanshinone effectively counteracts these effects. CONCLUSION: This multidisciplinary study unveils PLK1 as a pivotal molecular target through which EDs drive PCa progression. Furthermore, we identify five natural compounds, notably Cryptotanshinone, that counteract the carcinogenic effects of EDs by targeting PLK1. These findings provide crucial molecular insights into ED-induced carcinogenesis and reveal promising targets for the prevention and intervention of PCa."

    "abstract": "R-loops consist of double-stranded DNA-RNA hybrids and a complementary DNA strand that is displaced from the duplex. R-loops play important role in numerous normal physiological processes, including DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, RNA editing, replication, DNA repair, immunoglobulin class switching, and chromosome segregation during cell division. However, excessive or untimely formation of R-loops can lead to replicative collapse and subsequent DNA damage, resulting in genomic instability. One type of genomic rearrangements that is strongly associated with cancer malignancy is the extrachromosomal amplification of genes on circular DNA molecules (ecDNA). These molecules are relieved of hereditary constraints and conventional segregation laws and can endow cancer cells with the ability to rapidly change their genome, thereby accelerating tumor evolution and the development of therapy resistance. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that upregulated transcription of a gene can increase its susceptibility to amplification. Although the mechanisms underlying these processes are not yet fully understood, R-loops may play an important role in initiating gene amplification. In this review, we highlight the role of R-loops in replicative collapse, double-strand breaks, and DNA damage repair. We also provide examples of gene amplifications that is known to be induced by R-loops. Finally, we discuss amplification mechanisms in which involvement of R-loops has not yet been demonstrated, but appears highly likely."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is considered a potential therapeutic strategy for cancers, as it exacerbates calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), thereby inducing apoptosis. However, the mechanisms underlying TNF-alpha's effects at the single-molecule level remain unclear. METHODS: This study employed multiple modes of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to investigate the impact of TNF-alpha on breast cancer cells. The measurements were performed with nanometer spatial resolution, picoNewton force sensitivity, picoAmpere current precision, and 0.1 mV surface potential accuracy. RESULTS: The results revealed that TNF-alpha treatment significantly increased the density and aggregation of VGCCs on the cell membrane while enhancing their channel activity. Concurrently, the electrical conductivity and surface potential of the membrane were elevated, collectively promoting exacerbated calcium influx. DISCUSSION: These findings elucidate the mechanisms by which TNF-alpha modulates VGCC distribution and electrophysiological properties to amplify calcium signaling, ultimately triggering apoptosis. This study provides unprecedented insights into TNF-alpha-induced calcium dysregulation in cancer cells at the single-molecule level, offering a novel approach for investigating apoptosis and advancing targeted therapies for breast cancer and other malignancies."

This study presents the design, synthesis, and evaluation of new quinoline- and coumarin-derived isoxazole analogs (7a-e, 8a-f, 9a-e) and their Re(i) and Ru(ii) complexes (7b(Re), 9b(Re), 7b(Ru), 9b(Ru)). Antiproliferative assays against eight human cancer cell lines and noncancerous PBMCs identified quinoline amidoxime 8f as particularly potent, with IC(50) values of 2.1-4.7 microM against hematologic cancers (DND-41, HL-60, Z-138) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Capan-1), with selectivity indices of up to 48. Permeability and metabolic stability studies showed high membrane permeability and moderate clearance for 8f. Molecular docking, validated by redocking of J1Q (PDB ID: 6QGK), confirmed that 8f forms stable, energetically favorable complexes with Bcl-2 (DeltaG_bind = -84.98 kcal mol(-1)). These results support 8f as a promising lead compound for further development as a selective Bcl-2-targeted anticancer agent."

The objectives of the current article are to identify the potential barriers that can limit cervical cancer screening in rural areas and propose targeted interventions to overcome them to improve the overall uptake of these screening services. In rural settings, with limited number of healthcare establishments, it becomes difficult for women to access screening services, and the limited number of specialists and trained healthcare personnel further augments the concern. Acknowledging the magnitude of the problem and the preventable nature of the disease, it is the need of the hour to strengthen cervical cancer screening programs and integrate these activities into rural healthcare delivery systems. In conclusion, the implementation of screening for cervical cancer in rural settings can play a huge role in the early detection and improvement of the overall prognosis. This calls for the need to identify potential barriers and implement specific interventions to improve early detection of cervical cancer and reduce disparities in access to screening in rural settings."

We present the case of a 66-year-old multiparous postmenopausal woman with a previous history of invasive breast carcinoma, managed with mastectomy, chemotherapy, and hormone treatment. The patient presented with vaginal bleeding and leukorrhea. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed endometrial thickening with myometrial and parametrial invasion, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed no evidence of nodal or distant metastases. The pipelle biopsy revealed poorly differentiated cancer. She underwent a robotic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, omental biopsy, and peritoneal cytology procedures. The histopathological analysis verified a pure LCNEC and was staged as pT2N0M0. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for synaptophysin, CD56, chromogranin, and p53 (mutant), weak positivity for EMA, and a Ki-67 index of 80%. The tumor exhibited microsatellite stability, and next-generation sequencing revealed no relevant mutations. She received adjuvant therapy with pelvic radiation with concurrent cisplatin, followed by vaginal brachytherapy, and four cycles of chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide. This case demonstrates favorable outcomes with multimodal therapy, emphasizing the importance of timely management of this rare entity."

Despite the known benefits, many women do not meet the recommended activity levels and view household tasks as sufficient owing to factors such as time constraints, lack of motivation, or physical limitations. This article explores the significance, forms, and health impacts of PA in menopausal women. Regular PA, including aerobic exercise, resistance training, and yoga, offers several health benefits. Exercise enhances adult neurogenesis, brain structure, learning, memory, and cognitive abilities, potentially preventing age-related declines. PA during mid-life, defined as regular engagement in exercise such as walking, cycling, or resistance training, is linked to successful aging. Successful aging refers to the absence of chronic illnesses, disabilities, or mental health issues. Exercise improves sleep quality and reduces stress through endorphin production. Regular PA reduces the risk of chronic diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Recommendations include cardiorespiratory activities, strength training, and balance exercises. Understanding these benefits can promote better health outcomes in this critical life stage."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study recruited 142 women with biopsy-proven cervical cancer (the case group) and 142 women with normal cytology (the control group). DNA extracted from blood via QIAamp DNA mini kit. The DNA of each participant was amplified and the genotype and allelic frequency were compared. RESULTS: In our study, maximum women in the case group had stage II (69.7%) squamous cell carcinoma (97.2%). 75.4% of the cases had moderately differentiated carcinoma and had no treatment before (43.7%). Among cases, the prevalence of genotype CC, CT and TT was 42.3%, 19.7% and 38.0%, respectively compared to 54.9%, 13.4% and 31.7%, in controls.

Early identification of malignant pathology is critical for effective management. This study aims to evaluate the histopathological spectrum of endometrial abnormalities in women with AUB and assess the diagnostic utility of endometrial thickness (ET) and endometrial volume (EV) in predicting endometrial carcinoma. METHODS: This retrospective study included women presenting with AUB who underwent transvaginal ultrasound and endometrial sampling. Histopathological findings were categorized into benign, polypoidal, hyperplastic, and malignant groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine optimal ET and EV cutoff values for predicting endometrial malignancy. RESULTS: Disordered proliferative endometrium was the most common histological finding (38.0%), followed by endometrial hyperplasia (14.0%) and endometrial carcinoma (8.7%). Malignancy was significantly associated with age >50 years (46.2%, P = 0.002), higher body mass index (mean 35.6, P = 0.024), and hypertension (HTN) (84.6%, P < 0.001). ROC analysis showed that an EV cutoff of 15 ml had superior diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] =0.96, sensitivity = 90.2%, specificity = 95.4%) compared to an ET cutoff of 12 mm (AUC = 0.90, sensitivity = 78.0%, specificity = 96.3%). CONCLUSION: Age, obesity, and HTN are significant risk factors for endometrial carcinoma in patients with AUB. EV demonstrates superior diagnostic performance compared to ET and holds promise as a valuable, noninvasive marker in the evaluation of endometrial malignancy. Incorporating EV into routine diagnostic algorithms improves early cancer detection and reduces the need for invasive procedures."

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 120 breast cancer patients who received treatment at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University between January 2020 and December 2023. A total of 100 healthy individuals undergoing routine physical examinations were enrolled as the control group. Serum levels of free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroglobulin antibody (TG-Ab), and Thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) were measured and compared between the two groups. The diagnostic performance of thyroid hormones for breast cancer was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and correlations between thyroid hormone levels and pathological features of breast cancer were further analyzed. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in serum FT3, TSH, T3, or T4 levels between the two groups (P = 0.446, 0.594, 0.405 and 0.781, respectively). Compared with healthy controls, patients with breast cancer were observed to have significantly higher FT4 levels and substantially higher TPO-Ab levels, despite both parameters remaining within their normal reference ranges (all P < 0.001). ROC analysis demonstrated that the areas under the curve (AUCs) of FT4 and TPO-Ab for predicting breast cancer were 0.701 and 0.805, respectively. Furthermore, FT4 levels were significantly associated with tumor size, clinical stage, and lymph node metastasis (all P < 0.001). TPO-Ab levels were significantly correlated with tumor size, clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) (P = 0.006, 0.015, 0.046, 0.048 and 0.017, respectively). Follow-up analysis further revealed that clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy, ER and PR expression, as well as FT4 and TPO-Ab levels, were independent factors influencing breast cancer recurrence. CONCLUSION: Serum FT4 and TPO-Ab levels are closely associated with the occurrence, progression, and specific pathological features of breast cancer, demonstrating favorable diagnostic and predictive value. Moreover, they may serve as important potential biomarkers for evaluating the risk of recurrence in patients with breast cancer."

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the DNA methylation test results of 150 lung cancer patients and 100 patients with benign lung lesions enrolled from January 2021 to December 2023. Quantitative methylation fluorescence analysis and bisulfite sequencing were used to measure ctDNA gene methylation, with ROC curves assessing early-stage diagnostic value. Lung cancer patients were followed for 1 year, then grouped by survival status. Cox regression identified poor prognosis factors, and ROC curves evaluated ctDNA methylation's prognostic value. An external cohort of 80 lung cancer patients from May 2022 to December 2023 validated the model using ROC and calibration curves. RESULTS: The positivity rates of SHOX2, CDO1, and SOX17 were significantly higher in lung cancer patients than those in controls (all P<0.05). The combined diagnostic model of these genes had a higher AUC than single-marker tests (Z = 2.363, 2.157, 2.061, all P<0.05). Compared with the favorable prognosis group, the unfavorable prognosis group had a higher proportion of stage III-IV tumors and higher positivity rates of SHOX2, CDO1, SOX17, and HOXA7 (all P<0.05). SHOX2, CDO1 and SOX17 were identified as independent poor-prognosis risk factors (all P<0.05), and their combined prognostic assessment outperformed single-marker tests (Z = 3.316, 2.394, 2.696, all P<0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with negative methylation of SHOX2, CDO1, and SOX17 had longer survival (Log-rank chi (2) = 6.273, 4.524, 4.364, P<0.001). The model showed good predictive performance (AUC = 0.773), and external validation confirmed its accuracy (AUC = 0.682). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal methylation of SHOX2, CDO1, and SOX17 is prevalent in lung cancer, potentially serving as biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognostic monitoring."

This study aims to identify endometriosis-associated prognostic biomarkers in OC. METHODS: Transcriptomic and clinical data from TCGA-OC and GSE53963 were integrated for comprehensive analysis. Prognostic models were constructed using LASSO and Cox regression. Tumor microenvironment (TME) characteristics, immune checkpoints, and drug sensitivity were evaluated with ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT, TIDE, and drug sensitivity profiling. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq, GSE184880) was employed to explore immune and gene expression patterns. MEGF8 function was validated through in vitro assays. RESULTS: Consensus clustering identified three OC molecular subtypes (A, B, and C), with subtype B showing significantly better overall survival (P = 0.001). Subtype A exhibited a \"dual malignant phenotype\", characterized by enhanced cell adhesion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), TGF-beta activation, and an immunosuppressive TME. An 8-gene prognostic model, including MEGF8, effectively stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups, with high-risk patients showing poorer survival, immune evasion, and elevated stromal scores. Drug sensitivity analysis indicated that the low-risk group was more responsive to PI3K/AKT/mTOR and VEGFR inhibitors. MEGF8 was identified as a key regulator in cancer stem cells, promoting tumor progression through metabolic reprogramming and extracellular matrix remodeling. Functionally, MEGF8 knockdown suppressed OC cell proliferation and migration. CONCLUSION: This study delineated the molecular-immune landscape of OC, established an 8-gene prognostic model, and identified MEGF8 as a potential therapeutic target. The model predicts responses to immunotherapy and targeted therapies, supporting personalized OC management."

Logistic regression analysis revealed that age >/= 60 years, serum albumin level, tumor duration, dysphagia, CASQ score, and BI score were significant factors associated with low intake dehydration in cancer patients. The constructed nomogram model showed no overfitting (P > 0.05 in the goodness-of-fit test), with an area under the ROC curve of 0.861. Decision curve analysis confirmed the model's practical value. Ten-fold cross-validation demonstrated the robustness of the model. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of low intake dehydration in cancer patients is influenced by age, albumin level, tumor duration, dysphagia, CASQ score, and BI score. The nomogram model effectively assesses the risk of low intake dehydration in these patients."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Colorectal cancer (CRC) has one of the highest incidence and mortality rates among cancers, particularly concerning the rates of diagnosis. Serum exosomes (Exos) are crucial mediators for the intercellular transmission of genetic information. These vesicles contain various tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) that play a role in the noncoding regulation of tumor genes. Consequently, they are anticipated to become valuable non-invasive diagnostic and predictive biomarkers for CRC. METHODS: At the Affiliated Taian City Central Hospital of Qingdao University, we isolated and extracted serum Exos from 201 healthy donors and 205 patients with CRC. To measure Exo physical morphology, we utilized qNano, transmission electron microscopy, and a particle size analyzer. Western blotting was conducted to confirm the expression of surface and nuclear proteins in the Exos. Gene chips were employed to screen for differentially expressed tRF RNAs. The quantitative PCR technology was deployed to ascertain 5'Leader-ArgTCG and 3'tRF-SerGCT differential expression. CRC diagnostic efficiency was assessed utilizing the area under the curve. RESULTS: We compared 5'Leader-ArgTCG and 3'tRF-SerGCT expression in 205 patients with CRC and 201 healthy donors. Among them, 5'Leader-ArgTCG was significantly downregulated, while 3'tRF-SerGCT was significantly upregulated. The diagnostic efficiency of predicting 5'Leader-ArgTCG and 3'tRF-SerGCT in serum Exos using survival curves was 0.659 and 0.659, respectively. Meanwhile, the diagnostic efficiency of combining the two tumor markers was 0.954. CONCLUSION: Serum Exos 5'Leader-ArgTCG and 3'tRF-SerGCT were differentially expressed in patients with CRC. Combining these two tumor markers may serve as a predictive indicator for the non-invasive diagnosis of CRC, demonstrating notable statistical significance."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of ciprofol or propofol anesthesia on cognitive function in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer. METHODS: Data of 100 elderly patients were retrospectively collected and cases were assigned to the observation group (ciprofol, n=50) and the control group (propofol, n=50) according to the anesthesia method. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and bispectral index (BIS) were recorded at anesthesia induction and intraoperative time points. Post-anesthesia recovery findings, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, incidence of agitation, and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) were compared. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively. Serum levels of aldosterone (ALD), cortisol (COR), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), S100beta protein, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and oxidative stress markers [reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD)] were measured before and after surgery. RESULTS: HR, MAP, and BIS values were significantly lower in the observation group than in the control group at corresponding time points. The observation group also had better recovery profiles, lower VAS scores, and reduced incidence of POCD and adverse reactions (P < 0.05). Postoperative MMSE scores were significantly higher in the observation group (P < 0.05). Although postoperative serum ALD, COR, ACTH, ROS, MDA, SOD, S100beta, and NSE levels increased in both groups, the elevation was less pronounced in the observation group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Ciprofol anesthesia effectively reduces intraoperative physiological fluctuations, alleviates postoperative stress response, and improves postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer."

METHODS: Human Endometrial cancer (EC) cell lines, HEC-1A and Ishikawa, were exposed to erianin, and cellular proliferation and migratory capacity were assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and the Transwell migration assay, respectively. Glutamine metabolism was evaluated by quantifying intracellular glutamine, alpha-ketoglutaric acid (alpha-KG), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). A xenograft tumor model was used to validate the antitumor efficacy of erianin in vivo. The changes in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling were analyzed by western blotting. RESULTS: Erianin treatment significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of EC cells in vitro and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Additionally, erianin downregulated glutamine metabolism, as evidenced by reduced levels of glutamic acid, alpha-KG, and ATP. Interestingly, activation of the ERK signaling pathway mitigated the antitumor and metabolic inhibitory effects of erianin on EC cells. CONCLUSION: Erianin inhibits glutamine metabolism and suppresses the growth of EC through the ERK signaling pathway."

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies, with surgery being one of its primary treatment modalities. The common sites of distant metastasis primarily include the lungs and bones. A 69-year-old male patient reported bowel movement onset accompanied by dizziness and occasional chest tightness two months prior to consultation. Upon completion of the Computed Tomography (CT) examination, the patient's scan revealed a heterogeneous mass shadow in the descending segment of the duodenum, measuring approximately 9.3 * 7.8 * 9.0 cm in size. Enhanced scanning demonstrated uneven enhancement, leading to the consideration of a malignant neoplastic lesion. The surrounding fatty spaces were indistinct, with multiple enlarged lymph nodes visible, suggestive of perineural lymph node metastasis. Due to the massive size of the tumor, its nature could not be definitively ascertained preoperatively, prompting the patient to undergo surgical resection. Postoperative pathological analysis indicated duodenal metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma. The metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma to the duodenum is exceedingly rare, especially in a patient seven years post-surgery from liver cancer. The treatment of duodenal metastasis from hepatic carcinoma is complex and necessitates individualized management strategies tailored to diverse clinical scenarios."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of molecular classification-based postoperative adjuvant therapy on survival outcomes and treatment safety in patients with endometrial cancer. METHODS: This retrospective study included 208 endometrial cancer patients treated between January 2022 and January 2025. Patients were divided into a control group (n = 102), receiving conventional adjuvant therapy, and an observation group (n = 106), receiving molecular classification-based personalized regimens. The primary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary measures included objective response, treatment-related toxicity, treatment delivery factors, patient-reported outcomes, and next-generation sequencing of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Multivariate Cox regression was used to explore molecular subtypes and clinicopathologic predictors of 5-year DFS. RESULTS: In the observation group, immune therapy was exclusively administered, and treatment regimens significantly differed from the control group, which received chemoradiotherapy. The observation group showed significantly better DFS (HR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.30-0.89, P = 0.01) and OS (HR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.21-0.95, P = 0.03). Molecular subtype analysis indicated better prognosis for POLE-ultramutated tumors and poorer prognosis for p53-abnormal tumors. The observation group had fewer adverse events (grade >/= 2: 38.7% vs. 63.7%, P = 0.001) and higher objective response rates (65.1% vs. 43.1%, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Molecular classification-based adjuvant therapy improved survival, response rates, and ctDNA clearance with fewer toxicities. These findings support incorporating molecular classification into postoperative treatment to enhance outcomes in endometrial cancer."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Esophageal carcinoma (ESCA) is a common malignancy, and modulating radiosensitivity is crucial for individualized treatment. Tenascin XB (TNXB) overexpression in tumors is speculated to influence radiosensitivity. This study aims to investigate whether TNXB overexpression prior to irradiation sensitizes human ESCA cells in vitro. METHODS: The expression of TNXB in tumor specimens was examined using Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry. The relationships between TNXB expression and clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed. Two human ESCA cell lines (TE-1 and OE33) were subjected to explore the effect of TNXB expression on radiosensitivity. DNA damage, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and protein expression were assessed by colony formation assay, western blotting and flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: TNXB displayed a low expression in tumor tissues. Reduced TNXB expression was significantly correlated with larger tumor size and higher TNM stage. TNXB overexpression coupled with X-ray irradiation markedly suppressed colony formation in TE-1 and OE33 cells, and increased gammaH2AX expression, apoptosis rate, and promoted cell cycle arrest. Additionally, the combined treatment of TNXB overexpression and X-ray irradiation resulted in upregulation and phosphorylation of Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) and P53, leading to elevated cleaved-caspase3 and decreased pro-caspase3 levels. si-ATM treatment reversed these effects. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that TNXB enhances radiosensitivity in TE-1 and TE-10 cells by the ATM/P53 pathway."

METHODS: A total of 170 CRC cases were retrospectively assigned to two equal groups: an investigation group (da Vinci Xi-assisted procedures) and a reference group (human camera assistant). Surgical and recovery outcomes were analyzed, including pain intensity, stress levels, and gastrointestinal and humoral immune functions. Additionally, the safety of the procedures and surgeons' subjective experiences were evaluated. RESULTS: The investigation group showed significant improvements, including reduced blood loss, shorter surgical duration, earlier drain removal and discharge, lower costs, and less post-operative pain (24, 48, and 72 hours post-surgery). This group also exhibited lower stress levels, fewer complications, and better recovery in terms of gastrointestinal and humoral immunity (all P<0.05). Surgeons in the investigation group reported higher scores for procedural vigor, operational efficiency, and comfort (P<0.05).

We aimed to generate a conceptual framework and establish the value criteria for evaluating treatments in mCRC and to apply this framework to assess the value of trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI) + bevacizumab (BEVA) in advanced lines of therapy for mCRC versus alternatives. METHODS: A multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) was conducted according to the modified EVIDEM assessment framework and the following process: defining the decision problem, selecting and structuring the related criteria identified in a literature review, weighting criteria, measurement of performance, and scoring alternatives, to evaluate of mCRC therapies in Catalonia (Spain). An expert panel of five members with experience in cancer treatment in Catalonia was involved. A hierarchical and non-hierarchical weighting of the criteria and sub-criteria was performed. An evidence matrix of available treatments was developed, and experts assigned scores comparing FTD/TPI + BEVA versus alternatives. RESULTS: Five value criteria and 18 sub-criteria were selected to evaluate mCRC therapies. According to hierarchical method, efficacy had the highest weight, followed by safety, and lower weights for the rest: cost, guidelines/expert consensus, and epidemiology. In the efficacy dimension, overall survival (OS) had the highest weight, while severe adverse events received the highest score in terms of safety. Non-hierarchical weighting corroborated these results. Treatment with FTD/TPI + BEVA obtained a positive overall value contribution of 0.91, 0.43 points considering only comparative criteria. Comparative criteria were highly important, obtaining values contribution for efficacy, safety and cost of 0.19, 0.15 and 0.12 points, respectively. OS (0.20), progression-free survival (0.19), disease control rate (0.16) and health-related quality of life (0.16) were the most relevant sub-criteria. CONCLUSION: Based on this MCDA, the high value contribution of FTD/TPI + BEVA suggests its substantial benefits over the most used alternatives."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Posttransplant immunosuppression in kidney transplant recipients is associated with an increased risk of developing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. Various dermatological and immunosuppression modulation strategies have been identified that may reduce the risk of CSCC, both in primary and secondary prevention settings. Recent recommendations have provided consensus regarding dermatological approaches to prevent CSCC. Comparable transplant nephrology recommendations to guide immunosuppression modulation for CSCC prevention are currently lacking, leading to marked variation in practice. METHODS: To address this knowledge gap, 46 international transplant nephrology experts participated in a 3-round Delphi survey to develop consensus recommendations for CSCC secondary prevention based on the actinic damage and skin cancer index stages of CSCC. RESULTS: The panel of experts reached consensus to consider a change in immunosuppression after multiple low-risk invasive CSCC (stage 5a, 1/y >3 y) and encouraged collaboration with dermatology to optimize dermatologic preventative care after the first CSCC. There was also consensus to prioritize azathioprine modification where this is present in an immunosuppressive regimen. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first international consensus recommendations for management of immunosuppression in kidney transplant recipients at discrete stages of CSCC. Additional prospective studies are necessary to determine the optimal management of immunosuppression in this patient population. These recommendations have been endorsed by the Board of the American Society of Transplantation."

METHODS: An oral inflammation-to-cancer progression animal model was established using 4-Nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO) drinking water and/or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Clinical oral leukoplakia (OLK), OSCC, and adjacent non-cancerous tissues were collected. Immunohistochemistry assessed CD46, TREM1, LC3B, ATG5 protein expression and PI3K-AKT/TNF pathway alterations in animal and clinical tissues. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) measured inflammatory cytokine levels in serum and saliva. High-throughput sequencing analyzed key pathways. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry revealed elevated CD46/TREM1 expression and reduced LC3B/ATG5 expression in OSCC tissues (P < 0.05). Serum levels of IL-6, IL-8, and GROalpha/CXCL1 progressively increased with advancing inflammation-to-cancer progression in rats, whereas salivary expression peaks occurred during the inflammatory phase. In human saliva and serum, TNF-alpha, IL-8, and IL-6 exhibited an increasing trend among healthy individuals, oral leukoplakia patients, and OSCC patients (P < 0.05). Transcriptome analysis revealed a significant increase in differentially expressed genes during the transformation from OLK to OSCC, predominantly downregulated genes. Among these, Col4a6 and Csf2 genes participated in inflammation-to-cancer progression by regulating the PI3K-Akt and TNF pathways. CONCLUSION: CD46 and TREM1 are highly expressed in OSCC and serve as key initiating factors in the progression from OLK to OSCC. Bioinformatics analysis identified critical candidate genes (Col4a6, Csf2) and pathways (PI3K-Akt, TNF) in inflammation-to-cancer conversion. Activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is associated with inhibited autophagy and malignant progression of OSCC. Additionally, inflammation-to-cancer transition is a core mechanism in the development of OSCC, with the tumor inflammatory microenvironment acting as a \"promoter\" in the progression from OLK to OSCC. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms and targeted therapies for OSCC, holding significant theoretical and clinical application value."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Current sun safety advice focuses on minimizing exposure to sunlight, due to the relationship between ultraviolet radiation and skin cancer. However, sunlight also has beneficial effects, and there are calls for guidance to reflect these alongside the harmful effects. To examine the net effect of harmful and beneficial aspects, we aimed to determine the association between sunlight exposure and all-cause mortality. Additionally, we examined cause-specific mortality and whether the associations varied according to skin type/colour or ethnicity. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review, searching MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Nov 2023) for reports of epidemiological studies in the general population investigating the effect of long-term sun exposure on all-cause, cardiovascular-related, or cancer-related mortality. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the findings and assessed risk of bias using the ROBINS-E tool. PROSPERO: CRD42023474157. RESULTS: The search identified 73 eligible articles, with 55 included in the narrative synthesis. Methods of measuring sunlight exposure comprised radiation, proxy measures of radiation (e.g., latitude) and behaviour associated with sunlight exposure. The evidence was mixed. While most studies of skin cancer mortality found a higher risk associated with more exposure to sunlight, many studies of other cancers reported lower associated risk. Evidence for all-cause mortality was mixed, as were findings for cardiovascular mortality. Results were subject to high risk of bias, largely due to the likelihood of uncontrolled confounding and the use of indirect measures of sunlight exposure. There were insufficient data regarding any differential effects of sunlight on mortality for those of different skin types/colours or ethnicity. CONCLUSION: Findings from observational epidemiological studies of the association between sunlight exposure and mortality vary across different disease outcome and location being investigated. As such, the findings do not provide a strong rationale for changes to sun protection guidance."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since 2017, guidelines recommend a four-drug prophylactic antiemetic regimen-5HT3 receptor antagonist (5HT3RA), NK1 receptor antagonist (NK1RA), dexamethasone, and olanzapine-for patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). This study examines prophylactic olanzapine prescribing in patients initiating HEC and associated sociodemographic, clinical, and contextual factors. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using electronic health record data from an academic cancer center and affiliated community practices across the state of North Carolina, joined with geocoded community factors. Adults >/=21 years initiating cisplatin, carmustine, dacarbazine, mechlorethamine, streptozocin, or cyclophosphamide plus anthracycline (AC) in 2022 were included. Antiemetic orders placed before HEC administration were classified as three-drug (5HT3RA, NK1RA, dexamethasone) or four-drug (plus olanzapine). Late olanzapine use (within 30 days post-HEC) was also assessed. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated factors associated with regimen type. RESULTS: Among 878 patients, all received orders for the three-drug regimen, but only 300 (34.2%) had olanzapine ordered within 30 days before first HEC. After adjusting for covariates, olanzapine prescribing was less likely in patients with breast (OR = 0.13, 95%CI = 0.07-0.23), gastrointestinal (OR = 0.20, 95%CI = 0.04-0.94), gynecological (OR = 0.14, 95%CI = 0.03-0.69), and head and neck (OR = 0.17, 95%CI = 0.05-0.66) compared to hematological cancers, in those receiving cisplatin (OR = 0.20, 95%CI = 0.06-0.70) and carmustine (OR = 0.02, 95%CI = 0.00-0.48) compared to AC, and in community (OR = 0.40, 95%CI = 0.27-0.61) versus academic settings. Prescribing was also lower among patients residing in low- (OR = 0.49, 95%CI = 0.25-0.93) or lower-middle income (OR = 0.50, 95%CI = 0.32-0.78) areas, but higher among those living >6 miles from treatment facilities (OR = 1.95, 95%CI = 1.08-3.58). Among patients without prophylactic olanzapine, 12.5% were prescribed it within 1 to 30 days post-HEC. CONCLUSIONS: Despite guideline recommendations, prophylactic olanzapine use in HEC remains suboptimal, influenced by clinical and non-clinical contextual factors. Targeted efforts at information dissemination and updated prescribing systems are needed to promote equitable, evidence-based supportive care."

It is important for 25-year-olds to join the cervical screening programme so that cervical cancer can be prevented, detected, and ultimately eliminated, but screening uptake by younger women is low. AIM: The study aimed to hear young women's thoughts, experiences, and knowledge of cervical screening, including their ideas for encouraging participation in the cervical screening programme. METHODS: The study was part of a wider mixed-methods implementation trial based in Te Tai Tokerau. This qualitative component was grounded in a Kaupapa Maori methodology, by, for, and with Maori, involving a structural analysis of inequities and hearing from participants via semi-structured interviews. Interviews with 24 women aged between 18 and 30 and one whanau (family) were undertaken. RESULTS: Data were organised into four pou (pillars): Rangatiratanga (self-determination, autonomy, sovereignty), Manaaki (support, encouragement, whanaungatanga), Kura (education, public health campaigns), and Mana Taurite (equity, access issues, system issues). DISCUSSION: The empowering and easy elements of the HPV self-test, and playing an active part in cervical cancer elimination, encourage young women to participate in cervical screening, but cost is the greatest barrier to screening access. General practice also plays a critical role in championing cervical screening. This has implications for better primary care resourcing to connect and support young women to screening. HPV self-testing in the National Cervical Screening Programme has the opportunity to flip the narrative of cervical screening from burden to action."

    "abstract": "Methylglyoxal (MGO) and glyoxal (GO) are reactive carbonyl species (RCS) generated as side products in glycolysis and carbohydrate, protein, and fat catabolism, which are enriched in most cancer cells. MGO/GO-induced nonenzymatic glycation on histones plays pathophysiologically important roles in regulating the three-dimensional architecture of cellular chromatin and cancer development. In our previous studies, we have uncovered that enzymes DJ-1 and PAD4 exhibit \"glyoxalase\" and \"deglycase\" activities to antagonize the MGO/GO-modifications of histones. We also found that the general inhibition of histone deacetylases using suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) antagonized histone MGO-glycation due to the direct competition of reactive sites (i.e., lysine residues). Here, we report that a histone deacetylase, sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), functions as a \"semi-deglycase\" that removes lactic and glycolic acids from epsilon-N-l-lactyllysine and hydroxyacetyllysine residues, which are derived from MGO/GO-lysine adducts through the isomerization catalyzed by DJ-1. Overall, SIRT2 is a newly identified regulator for histone glycation, which can prevent the cytotoxicity of MGO and GO by eventually converting them into lactate and glycolate with the assistance of an enzymatically inactive DJ-1 mutant (i.e., DJ-1-C106A)."

    "abstract": "Historical redlining, a 1930s residential segregation policy, has been associated with contemporary breast cancer survival, but the role of contemporary neighborhood socioeconomic condition is unclear. We investigated mediating and modifying effects of neighborhood socioeconomic condition. This New York State Cancer Registry-based cohort included 60,773 invasive breast cancer cases. Cases were assigned a historical redlining grade (A-D) through linkage to residential census tract at diagnosis. We used labor class index of concentration at the extremes to proxy neighborhood socioeconomic condition. Four-way decomposition evaluated mediation and modification of neighborhood socioeconomic condition on redlining and breast cancer survival. The total effect (risk ratio, RR) on 5-year mortality from D-grade vs. A-grade =1.20 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.31), which decomposed to a controlled direct effect excess RR (ERR)=0.10 (95% CI: -0.01, 0.21) and a pure indirect effect ERR=0.09 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.13); significant interaction was not detected. Results were consistent among hormone receptor+, local-, and regional-stage tumors, but not HR- or distant-stage tumors. Decomposition differs by race/ethnicity. Contemporary neighborhood socioeconomic condition mediates approximately half the association between historical redlining and all-cause breast cancer survival, while the other half is attributed to historical redlining. Interventions addressing neighborhood socioeconomic condition may attenuate redlining-based breast cancer survival disparities."

    "abstract": "Clinical trials have shown that low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening reduces lung cancer mortality among selected groups of ever-smokers. Nordic countries have yet to implement lung cancer screening programs in part due to limited evidence on the associated health and economic consequences. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of LDCT screening compared with no screening for Norwegian individuals aged 50-74 years who ever smoked, using the Dutch-Belgian NELSON screening-eligibility criteria and trial outcomes. In addition, we evaluated the potential need and value of additional research to improve decision-making about LDCT screening implementation. We developed a probabilistic simulation model reflecting the Dutch-Belgian NELSON trial outcomes and Norwegian epidemiological, cost, and health-related quality-of-life data to evaluate long-term (discounted) health and economic consequences from an extended healthcare perspective. Model outputs included sex-stratified clinical and economic outcomes. Cost-effectiveness was summarized using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Compared with no screening, NELSON-like LDCT screening provided an additional 0.043 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per screened man for an additional $1286, yielding an ICER of $30,672 per QALY gained. For women, screening yielded greater health benefits and therefore a lower ICER (i.e., $22,249 per QALY gained), though there was greater uncertainty around health benefits. Additional analyses indicated potential value in collecting further evidence on screening-related outcomes to reduce decision uncertainty, particularly for women. Given Norwegian benchmarks for good value and achieving similar mortality benefits to the NELSON trial, LDCT lung cancer screening for individuals who ever smoked under \"NELSON-like\" criteria may be considered cost-effective for both men and women in Norway."

Sixty-four patients with alterations such as EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 who received targeted agents were retrospectively analysed. EGFR mutations were most common (67.2%). Among EGFR-TKI-treated patients, median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 12.4 and 14.3 months, respectively. Alectinib yielded a median PFS of 18.6 months and OS of 29.8 months in ALK-positive patients, while crizotinib produced a median PFS and OS of 7 months in ROS1-positive patients. The overall response rate was 50% and the disease control rate 84.4%. Although targeted therapies prolonged PFS compared with chemotherapy, this improvement did not translate into a significant OS advantage, likely influenced by retrospective design and treatment crossover. Findings represent real-world outcomes in a molecularly defined subgroup."

A secondary objective is to identify resources and strategies that may strengthen resiliency and support continuity of care in radiation oncology clinics located in weather-vulnerable regions.MethodsWe developed a comprehensive online cross-sectional survey to evaluate clinic emergency preparedness and the impact of extreme weather events on radiation oncology clinic stakeholders in PR. Potential participants were identified through the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) membership directory and were invited to participate via email and direct outreach.ResultsFourteen radiation oncologists and four medical physicists were invited to participate, with a response rate of 56% (n = 10), representing 71.4% of radiation oncology clinics in PR. Among respondents, 90% reported clinical disruptions due to extreme weather events from 2017 to 2024. The most commonly reported impacts were property damage (90%), communication failures between providers, patients and staff (90%), power outages (80%), and school and/or childcare closures (80%). A majority (90%) supported developing comprehensive supportive resources, including professional society resources, to enhance disaster preparedness and operational resiliency.ConclusionRadiation oncology providers in PR reported significant disruptions in care delivery from extreme weather events and identified a need for strong resiliency measures. Institutional policy, coupled with targeted support from professional societies, may reduce lapses in treatment, safeguard vulnerable patients - particularly those with complex treatment plans - and improve continuity of care and outcomes in weather-prone regions."

Intraperitoneal (IP) administration enhances local drug concentrations, improving survival outcomes for PM patients. However, rapid drug clearance and uneven distribution limit its therapeutic potential. In recent years, hydrogel-based drug delivery systems have garnered attention due to their excellent biocompatibility, drug loading capacity, and controlled release properties. The use of hydrogel-loaded drugs via IP injection can significantly improve anti-cancer efficacy by increasing the local drug concentration, prolonging the retention time of the drug in the peritoneal cavity, and decreasing systemic toxicity. This review summarizes the pathogenesis and current treatment strategies of PM, emphasizing various drugs (including chemotherapy agents, immunotherapeutics, targeted drugs, radioactive isotopes, and herbal medicines) delivered via hydrogel-based IP administration. Furthermore, it highlights the potential of nanoparticles and microparticle-hydrogel composites to further improve drug delivery, offering new strategies for PM treatment and theoretical basis for clinical rational drug use."

    "abstract": "We formulated a nanonetwork of an amphiphilic polyurethane integrated with a tertiary amine group on the backbone and a pyridyl disulfide group as a pendant. The disulfide linkages within the nanonetwork undergo reductive cleavage in the intracellular redox environment of cancer cells, enabling sustained and site-specific drug release. The positive surface-charge generation under tumor extracellular matrix-like mildly acidic conditions promotes selective uptake of the nanonetwork by cancer cells while minimizing interaction with normal cells, as shown by flow cytometry analysis. Biological evaluation confirmed selective internalization and potent cytotoxicity in HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cells following treatment with NN@DOX, while normal cells were effectively shielded from off-target toxicity. Furthermore, the dual-drug-loaded nanonetwork (NN@DOX-CPT) exhibited superior therapeutic outcomes, as demonstrated by a significantly lower IC(50) (3.98 mug/mL) value compared to single-drug formulations, NN@DOX (IC(50) = 9.89 mug/mL), confirming a combined effect. Overall, this polymeric nanonetwork could be a promising system for combination drug-based targeted chemotherapy."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: RCC management has evolved toward immunotherapy-based strategies, with adjuvant anti - PD-1 therapy after nephrectomy and immune - VEGF TKI combinations in the metastatic setting now representing standards of care. Outcomes remain variable because of biological heterogeneity, treatment resistance and the limited performance of currently available biomarkers. AREAS COVERED: This review synthesizes contemporary standards of care together with advances in tumor biology and biomarker development, and appraises investigational modalities across immune, targeted and cellular platforms. We analyze how standards of care and translational insights have evolved in recent years, outlining the principal directions of current and investigational treatments. EXPERT OPINION: The field is moving toward biology-informed treatment selection. Priorities include prospective validation of biomarker strategies, standardization of assay platforms, and integration of dynamic response measures to refine treatment selection, sequencing and combinations. Molecularly defined subsets and less common histologies warrant dedicated, adequately powered studies. With rigorous methodology and standardized testing methods, emerging approaches have the potential to translate current signals into more consistent and durable clinical benefit in RCC."

    "abstract": "Despite a steady decline in incidence, tuberculosis (TB) remains a substantial public health burden in South Korea, particularly among older adults. Existing national TB surveillance systems lack sufficiently comprehensive data to assess long-term outcomes and health disparities. The K-TB-N cohort integrates data from 3 national sources: the Korean Tuberculosis Surveillance System (2011-2022), the National Health Insurance Database (2010-2022), and mortality data from Statistics Korea (2010-2022). After data cleaning and linkage, the final cohort included 373,812 patients with either drug-susceptible or drug-resistant TB. TB notifications declined by approximately 60% over the study period, while the median patient age continued to rise. Treatment success improved over time, accompanied by reductions in loss to follow-up. However, mortality during treatment increased, with more than half of deaths attributed to non-TB causes such as pneumonia, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Post-treatment mortality also remained high, particularly among patients with drug-resistant TB. The K-TB-N cohort provides a comprehensive, linked dataset for advancing research on TB epidemiology, treatment outcomes, comorbidities, and health disparities. It enables evaluations of public health interventions, long-term prognosis, and strategies for post-TB care. This cohort will remain a valuable resource for shaping data-driven TB control policies in aging and high-burden settings."

    "abstract": "Bivalent chromatin maintains genes in low-expression, poised states in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, bivalent promoters correlate with the transcriptional activation of oncogenic programs in malignancies, a seemingly contradiction that remains to be resolved. Here, we identify a class of cancer-specific bivalent promoters (CSBPs) through the integration of a system-level longitudinal framework. Compared with ESCs, CSBPs are characterized by lower and narrower H3K27me3 deposition alongside abundant H3K4me3, thus permitting the persistent expression of genes critical for cancer stem cell (CSC) formation and maintenance, as exemplified by SOX9. The generation of CSBPs is essentially induced by the acquisition of H3K27me3 during cell state transition, which is mediated by specific binding of PRC2.1 and the de novo recruitment of PRC2.2. Notably, disrupting the bivalency of CSBPs significantly increases H3K4me3 levels, leading to hyperactivation of CSBPs and eventually inhibiting clonal expansion of CSCs and impairing tumorigenesis. Our study not only helps explain the puzzle of transcriptionally active bivalent genes in cancer but also provides insights into the development of therapies targeting phenotypic plasticity."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) lung metastases exhibit high recurrence rates after resection, underscoring the need for improved therapeutic strategies. This study aimed to characterize the tumor microenvironment (TME) of CRC lung metastases and identify the factors associated with recurrence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen CRC patients who underwent lung metastasectomy were enrolled. Multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC), whole exome sequencing, transcriptome profiling, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) were conducted on matched tumor, adjacent and distant normal lung tissues. Immune cell populations and gene expression profiles were analyzed and correlated with clinical recurrence outcomes. RESULTS: Exome and transcriptome analyses revealed frequent TP53, KRAS, and APC mutations. Most tumors corresponded to consensus molecular subtypes 2 and 4, characterized by immune-depleted and fibrotic features. Tumors showed downregulation of effector T and NK cell signatures. IHC revealed reduced density and increased distance of CD8+ T cells and macrophages from the epithelial cells. scRNA-seq demonstrated increased regulatory T cells and decreased NK and effector T cells in tumor. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), particularly SPP1 (osteopontin)-expressing subsets, were markedly enriched in tumor and correlated with suppressed effector T cella activity. High SPP1 expression was associated with early recurrence and poor overall survival. Patients with recurrence had higher proportion of PD-1+ CD8+ T cells in adjacent normal tissues. CONCLUSION: Immunosuppressive features including enrichment of SPP1+ TAMs and depletion of effector T and NK cells contribute to recurrence after CRC lung metastasectomy. Therapeutic strategies targeting both TAMs and T cells may enhance clinical outcomes in this patient population."

    "abstract": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) has evolved from a poor prognostic factor to one of the most impactful predictive biomarkers in oncology. The introduction of trastuzumab established HER2 as a binary determinant of therapy, with HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) becoming the treatment-guiding diagnostic assay. However, the emergence of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), particularly trastuzumab deruxtecan, has challenged this paradigm by demonstrating activity in tumors with low and even ultralow HER2 expression. This review outlines the evolution of HER2 testing, from its historical discovery and early assay variability to the ADC era, where categories such as HER2-low and HER2-ultralow have emerged. We highlight key challenges: poor reproducibility at the lower end of IHC scoring, instability of HER2 status across timepoints and between primary and metastatic tumors, and no consistent biological distinction between low, ultralow, and null. Efforts to improve reliability-including structured training, high-sensitivity assays, RNA-based methods, and artificial intelligence-assisted pathology-are summarized. Finally, we reconsider the therapeutic implications of ADCs, with the question of whether the benefit parallels HER2 expression or extends into HER2-null disease. HER2 exemplifies how biomarker interpretation evolves with drug development. As new ADCs target additional antigens, pathologists must balance trial-driven categories with biologic reproducibility to ensure diagnostics remain aligned with therapeutic advances."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The Asia Pacific region is marked by healthcare diversity and economic disparity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To understand the utilization and reimbursement practices of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and other sequencing methods relevant to oncology clinical practice in the region, a semi-structured survey was undertaken of respondents from 11 countries represented by the Korean Society of Medical Oncology (KSMO) 2024 Young Oncologist Forum alumni. RESULTS: While 79% of respondents reported access to NGS at their institution, full government reimbursement was uncommon and varied by test type and clinical setting. Japan and South Korea offered the most comprehensive public coverage, including for circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA)-based liquid biopsy. Lower- and upper-middle-income countries, such as the Philippines, Indonesia, and India, reported no government reimbursement, thus relying on user-pay methods or private insurance payments. One marked barrier to NGS reimbursement was the prohibitive cost of tests (100%), followed by a limited budget to fund testing (79%), and then by policy or regulatory restrictions (50%). On a similar note, insurance coverage (93%) and patient income (86%) were key concerns regarding access and equity to tests. Test reimbursement (or lack thereof) and cost were cited almost universally as the most elevated concerns by the respondents. CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrated a wide disparity in access, funding and reimbursement of sequencing tests across the region. Addressing cost, improving reimbursement mechanisms, and building infrastructure capacity will be critical for the equitable integration of NGS into routine cancer care in the Asia-Pacific."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To determine if dose escalation improves outcomes for chondrosarcomas (CHS) of the base of the skull (BOS) and the cervical spine (CS). METHODS: A prospective, randomized, dose-escalation trial was designed for patients with CHS of the BOS and CS. Patients were randomly assigned to 70 Gy (RBE) or 76 Gy (RBE). The primary endpoint was local failure (LF). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), progression-free survival (PFS), and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS: Between 1987 and 2007, 105 patients were randomized, median follow-up was 29.2 years (IQR, 26.7-32.4). Forty-six patients were assigned to 70 Gy (RBE) and fifty-nine were assigned to 76 Gy (RBE). LF at 5-, 10-, and 20 years were 7%, 9%, and 11% for 70 Gy (RBE), and 10%, 15%, and 19% for 76 Gy (RBE) (p = 0.16). Like LF rates, there was no benefit in dose escalation for OS (p = 0.28) and CSS (p = 0.22). Progression-free survival at 5-, 10-, and 20 years was 93%, 89%, and 77% for the low-dose group and 83%, 71%, and 59% for the high-dose group (p = 0.069). Late RT injury >/= grade 3 was reported in a total of 19 (18%) patients across both dose levels, with 11% in the low-dose group and 24% in the high-dose group (p = 0.13). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first and largest trial of patients with grade I/II BOS and CS CHS evaluating dose escalation for tumor control. Proton-based RT is effective and safe for these tumors, but there is no apparent benefit in dose escalation."

    "abstract": "Numerous scientific studies have established that the BCG vaccination reduces susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections, particularly those causing respiratory tract ailments. This effect is partly attributed to the crossreactivity of BCG antigens, which reinforces immunity and presents an important avenue for therapeutic interventions against bladder cancer, Buruli ulcer, and leprosy. Remarkably, individuals residing in tuberculosis (TB)-endemic regions who have received BCG vaccinations exhibit a significant reduction in the incidence of monkeypox virus (MPV) infections. This observation could be attributed to shared T-cell and B-cell epitopes between mycobacteria and MPV, raising the possibility of eliciting cross-reactive immune responses. Such cross-reactivity could account for the enhanced protection conferred by the BCG vaccination against MPV infections. To explore this possibility, we employed advanced immunoinformatics tools. Our analysis successfully identified common CD4 T-cell, CD8 T-cell, and B-cell epitopes shared between MPV and mycobacteria. Notably, the T-cell epitopes demonstrated high immunogenicity and substantial affinity, with promiscuous binding to multiple human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and class II alleles, indicating the potential for these epitopes to trigger robust immune responses. Indeed, the predicted outcomes encompassed the induction of Th1-cell and Th2-cell responses via the predicted epitopes. These findings carry profound implications. They imply that prior exposure to cross-reactive mycobacterial antigens during recent pandemics could have contributed to increased levels of protection against MPV infections in TB-endemic regions, in contrast to areas non-endemic for TB. The identified T-cell and B-cell epitopes may thus serve as promising candidates for developing vaccines to combat MPV and mitigate its spread."

This study assessed the effects of exercise on PIPN severity in newly diagnosed advanced breast cancer patients. METHODS: The ExPIN Trial is an ongoing randomized clinical trial. This interim analysis, conducted between November 2022 and December 2023, included adult patients with locally advanced, non-metastatic breast cancer. Participants were randomized into interventional and control groups for 0 to 12 weeks. The primary outcome was nerve conduction studies. Secondary outcomes included balance scores, taxane-induced toxicity-related quality-of-life scores, emotional functioning, physical functioning, and functional impairments assessed at baseline, after chemotherapy, and at the first follow-up. RESULTS: Seventy patients were randomized. The mean (SD) age was 49.46 (9.52) years in the interventional group and 49.09 (8.10) years in the control group. At the completion of paclitaxel therapy, the amplitudes of the ulnar nerve (estimate: 1.98, P = .007), common peroneal nerve (estimate: 1.88, P = .003), and sural nerve (estimate: 6.20, P < .001) were significantly higher in the interventional group. On the EORTC scale (lower scores indicate better quality of life), sensory and motor scores significantly decreased in the interventional group by the end of therapy (-5.46 and -3.82, P < .001), indicating improvement. These improvements were sustained at follow-up (-1.99, P = .001, and -4.20, P < .001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Exercise intervention during paclitaxel therapy significantly reduced PIPN severity and improved quality of life. Findings are preliminary and warrant further confirmation."

METHODS: A comprehensive analysis of acetyl-CoA levels and ACSS2 expression across a range of samples, including patient specimens from both HBV positive and HBV negative HCC individuals, HBV-transgenic mouse HCC models, and multiple cell lines. Furthermore, to evaluate the functional significance of ACSS2 in HBV-related HCC, we implemented both genetic and pharmacological inhibition strategies targeting ACSS2. Molecular mechanism and mitophagy assessment were revealed by CUT &Tag, RNA sequencing, bioinformatic analyses, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and JC-1 staining. RESULTS: Our study revealed a distinct metabolic signature of HBV-related HCC, marked by elevated acetyl-CoA, which was driven by acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2). ACSS2 was upregulated by the carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) in HBV-related HCC. Furthermore, ACSS2 improved tumor cell proliferation, an effect that was dependent on its enzymatic activity. Mechanistically, ACSS2-induced acetyl-CoA accumulation activated voltage-dependent anion channels 1 (VDAC1) transcription through increased H3K27ac occupancy, which subsequently promoted mitophagy and HBV-related HCC tumorigenesis. Notably, targeting ACSS2 by depletion or inhibition with a catalytic inhibitor significantly suppressed tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: These findings not only illustrate the interplay between metabolic reprogramming, epigenetic modification, and tumorigenesis in the context of HBV infection, but also highlight ACSS2 as a novel metabolic vulnerability in HBV-related HCC. Therefore, targeting ACSS2 could be a novel strategy against HBV-associated HCC."

METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases, including Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar. A total of 20 studies were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: The results indicated that women with ovarian cancer had a significantly higher incidence of colorectal cancer (SIR, 1.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39-1.98), with an increased risk for both colon (SIR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.14-1.99) and rectal cancers (SIR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.38-1.78). Subgroup analysis of borderline ovarian tumor revealed an SIR for colorectal cancer of 1.27 (95% CI, 0.99-1.55), with a significant risk in the serous subtype (SIR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.09-1.67). Conversely, studies examining ovarian cancer in women diagnosed with colorectal cancer showed an SIR of 1.48 (95% CI, 1.17-1.79). Specifically, women with colon cancer had a higher incidence of ovarian cancer (SIR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.25-2.03), while women with rectal cancer showed a decreased risk (SIR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77-0.99). The results underscore the potential bidirectional relationship between ovarian and colorectal cancers, which may be influenced by genetic predispositions. CONCLUSION: Future advanced genetic studies are needed to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms. Additionally, the results emphasize the importance of careful cancer surveillance and early detection strategies for women with a history of either ovarian cancer or colorectal cancer."

The present study evaluated Losartan's protective effects against cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced POF. Forty female nulligravid Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Rats were randomly placed in four groups: Group I (control group); Group II (losartan group); received Losartan 100 mg/kg daily by gavage orally for thirty days; Group III (POF group): POF was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg of CP on day one of the experiment and then 8 mg/kg/day for fifteen serial days; Group IV (Losartan + POF group): received losartan 100 mg/kg daily for thirty days one hour before CP intraperitoneal dosage of 50 mg/kg on the first day of the experiment and then CP has given in a dose of 8 mg/kg/day for fifteen successive days. Physiological sera of blood and tissue samples were evaluated biochemically, hormonally, and histopathologically at the end of the experiment. Losartan treatment improved E2, FSH, LH, and oxidative stress biomarkers.Furthermore, coadministration of the Losartan to the POF group exhibited a significant lessening in systolic blood pressure, a significant improvement in ovarian blood flow velocity, and a significant decline in ovarian vascular resistance related to the POF group. Furthermore, Losartan reduced the histopathological and immunohistochemical alterations, enhanced SIRT1 gene expression, and decreased NF-kappaB gene expression. Our findings suggest that Losartan protects rats from cyclophosphamide-induced ovarian toxicity."

    "abstract": "The Mediator complex is a transcriptional co-factor for RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-dependent gene expression, with MED19 serving as an integral subunit. While MED19 overexpression has been documented in diverse cancer types to promote tumor progression, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we uncover a previously unrecognized function whereby MED19 localizes to the nucleolus independently of the Mediator complex. This nucleolar targeting is mediated by a conserved poly-lysine motif at the MED19 C-terminus, which enables binding to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and fibrillarin (FBL), a catalytic component of the 2'-O-methyltransferase complex and pre-rRNA processing factor. Mechanistically, MED19 facilitates rRNA processing and 2'-O-methylation that promotes the efficiency of internal ribosome entry site-dependent translation for a number of onco-promoting genes including c-Myc. Collectively, these findings reveal a novel Mediator-independent function of MED19 in regulating ribosome-mediated translational control, thus providing mechanistic insights into its onco-promoting role."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Achieving cervical cancer (CC) elimination requires addressing disparities in CC burden for women living with HIV (WLHIV) and how disparities evolve in the context of antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up. To inform CC elimination for high HIV prevalence regions, we modeled the impact of HIV, HIV interventions, and CC interventions in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. METHODS: We used two independently developed, dynamic compartmental transmission models of HIV and HPV (DRIVE and Policy1-Cervix-HIV) calibrated to KwaZulu-Natal. We simulated a counterfactual without HIV but with observed CC screening and vaccination; and scenarios sequentially adding condom use and voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC); HIV; observed HIV and CC interventions (status quo); achieving UNAIDS HIV treatment targets; and achieving WHO CC elimination targets. The impact of each scenario was measured as the difference in CC incidence from the previous scenario. Results were reported from 2024-2124 as a range between the two models; CC elimination was WHO-defined as incidence <4/100,000 women-years. RESULTS: For the status quo, CC incidence ranged from 61.30-78.96/100,000 women-years in 2024, with the highest incidence among WLHIV (126.8-192.0/100,000). HIV contributed an estimated 29.08-48.87 additional cases per 100,000. Neither model predicted elimination under status quo interventions, but achieving HIV treatment and CC elimination targets could reduce incidence to 1.42-6.25/100,000 women-years in 2124. CONCLUSIONS: HIV is associated with a population-level increase in CC incidence. However, scaling up ART coverage and CC interventions is expected to significantly reduce the burden of CC overall and among WLHIV. These conclusions are consistent between both models and strengthened by the comparative modeling approach."

    "abstract": "C-reactive protein (CRP) is a biomarker that significantly elevates in cancer patients. Its detection with high sensitivity and specificity is of paramount importance for the early diagnosis and screening of cancer. In this study, we proposed and experimentally demonstrated a CRP antibody-functionalized metasurface biosensor with a simplified metallic design, enabling high-sensitivity detection of CRP using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. Colloidal gold nanoparticles enhance the sensitivity and quantitative detection capabilities of the biosensor by leveraging the local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect and the enhanced biomolecular recognition. Moreover, the addition of a high concentration of CRP antibodies improves the antigen capture efficiency, thereby further boosting the sensor's performance. In this study, the designed biosensor was used to measure varying concentrations of CRP and two different types of antigens. By analyzing the sensor's response variations under different antigen-binding conditions, the specificity of its CRP recognition was validated. Experimental results demonstrated that the sensor exhibited a limit of detection as low as 100 pg/mL, with robust discriminatory capacity between target antigens and nonspecific molecular interference, ensuring exceptional selectivity in detection. This result further confirms the exceptional performance of the metasurface biosensor in precise biomolecular detection, providing crucial technological support for achieving efficient and accurate early cancer screening."

Beyond the dipole approximation, an analytical expression for the Kerr coefficient is derived, with key findings as follows: (1) The multipole effect enables a significant enhancement of the Kerr coefficient compared to the dipole approximation scenario, whereas increasing the spacing between the SQD and the MNS leads to substantial suppression of this coefficient; (2) The Kerr spectrum can be switched from a two-peaked to a three-peaked structure solely by tuning the exciton-phonon coupling strength; (3) The heights, positions, and full widths at half maximum (FWHM) of the two sideband peaks in the Kerr spectrum exhibit high sensitivity to both pumping intensity and dielectric shell thickness. Importantly, we demonstrate the feasibility of detecting the initiation of normal cell carcinogenesis by monitoring the heights, locations, and frequency shifts of these two sideband peaks.

In this work, we report the fabrication of a carboxy-functionalized porous organic polymer (POP) as a highly sensitive and selective fluorescent immunosensor for PSA detection. The POP was synthesized via a solvothermal Schiff base condensation, which bears free -COOH functionalities to facilitate covalent antibody immobilization through classical EDC/NHS coupling chemistry. The resulting POP-antibody bioconjugate exhibited a pronounced fluorescence quenching response upon PSA binding, attributed to static quenching via ground-state complex formation, as confirmed by steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence studies. Under optimized conditions, the sensor achieved a limit of detection (LOD) of 14 pg/mL, demonstrating a wide linear dynamic range and minimal cross-reactivity with nontarget biomolecules. The high surface area and hierarchical porosity of the POP matrix contributed to enhanced probe-analyte interactions and signal amplification. Notably, the sensor retained excellent performance in complex matrices, with successful PSA quantification in artificial urine and blood samples, highlighting its potential for real-world clinical diagnostics. The synergistic integration of structural surface functionality and photostability in this POP-based platform underscores its promise for ultrasensitive, low-cost, and point-of-care biosensing of cancer biomarkers."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have significantly improved outcomes for cancer patients. However, TKIs have a narrow therapeutic window, impact a high-risk population, and are frequently combined with additional medications, each of which increases the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). As polypharmacy becomes more common, especially in older and higher-risk groups that are prescribed TKIs, there is an increased risk for harmful DDIs. AREAS COVERED: TKI-related DDIs can lead to toxicity or reduced efficacy, which worsens patient outcomes and quality of life. In this review, we utilized the Drug Interaction Database (DIDB), FDA labels, and PubMed TKI DDI/ADME queries to focus on outlining the mechanisms underlying both pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) DDIs with TKIs. Pharmacokinetic DDIs involve changes in the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of a molecule (victim) caused by another drug (perpetrator). These DDIs may involve direct inhibition, post-translational modification, or transcriptional regulation. Pharmacodynamic DDIs involve overlapping mechanisms resulting in additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects when combining two medications. EXPERT OPINION: Understanding the mechanisms underlying DDIs facilitates a better grasp of TKI clinical pharmacology and will help in the development of strategies to optimize drug dosing and avoid DDIs."

However, despite significant therapeutic advances in recent years, the overall survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma remains poor. Consequently, it is necessary to identify further novel targets and drugs that can contribute to enhancing the prognosis of these patients. To this end, in this study, using siRNA silencing, we initially knocked down KPNA2 in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, and performed CCK8 and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assays to examine the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to determine whether the transcription factor FOXM1 can bind to the promoter region of KPNA2, and we used AlphaFold3 to predict the proteins that bind to KPNA2 and to characterize the binding sites on these proteins. We found that KPNA2 is upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma and that inhibiting its expression effectively reduced the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma cancer cells. Both bioinformatics analyses and experimental findings provided evidence that the expression of KPNA2 is directly controlled by FOXM1. Furthermore, we observed a reduction in FOXM1 expression following the suppression of KPNA2. These findings indicate the presence of a positive feedback loop between the expression of KPNA2 and FOXM1, which contributes to an enhanced proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma cells."

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PC) progression is predominantly driven by androgen signaling, making androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) the standard treatment. However, the transition to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) significantly reduces ADT efficacy. While taxanes such as docetaxel (Dtx) and cabazitaxel (Cbz) are widely employed, therapeutic resistance remains a major clinical obstacle. To address this, we established docetaxel-resistant CRPC models and performed an epigenetic drug screen, identifying MLL-Menin and MLL-WDR5 inhibitors as potent agents capable of restoring taxane sensitivity through G(2)/M arrest and apoptosis induction. Functional depletion of Menin (MEN1) revealed its critical role in sustaining chemoresistance, selectively impairing proliferation in resistant cells, and preventing resistance emergence in parental lines.Integrative transcriptomic (RNA-seq) and epigenomic (CUT&RUN-seq) analyses suggested that Menin may play a regulatory role in mTOR signaling and E2F target pathways. Menin binding to the promoters of mTOR and Cyclin D1 was confirmed, and rescue experiments further validated its regulatory role. Analysis of TCGA datasets demonstrated co-expression of MEN1 and mTOR in advanced metastatic PC, supporting clinical relevance. Moreover, combination treatment with the mTOR inhibitor Torin-1 and docetaxel synergistically enhanced therapeutic response in Menin-depleted resistant cells. MEN1 knockdown also abrogated tumor growth in vivo.These findings identify Menin as one of the key mediator of taxane resistance in CRPC through the regulation of mTOR. Targeting Menin, alone or in combination with mTOR inhibition, represents a promising strategy to overcome resistance and improve therapeutic outcomes in taxane-refractory PC."

Ratiometric codelivery has gained attention as a promising approach to improve the effectiveness of cancer chemotherapy to address the limitations of conventional monotherapies and random drug combinations. By enabling the simultaneous delivery of multiple anticancer drugs in fixed, synergistic ratios, this strategy helps achieve synergistic effects, reduces systemic toxicity, and combats multidrug resistance. The review outlines the scientific rationale behind this approach and the importance of maintaining optimal drug ratios for effective cancer treatment. The emphasis is placed on nanocarrier platforms, such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles, that enable the simultaneous and targeted release of drugs at optimized ratios. The article also examines the synergistic and combinatorial delivery, release kinetics, and in vitro and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of these systems in enhancing treatment outcomes across various cancer types. Furthermore, the technical challenges, clinical studies, and commercial landscape are also highlighted. This review concludes by outlining future directions and the need for translational research to bring ratiometric codelivery systems from bench to bedside."

However, the role of E26 transformation-specific homologous factor (EHF) in EC remains poorly characterized. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Public databases were utilized to investigate the molecular features of EHF and its significance in the pathogenesis of EC. Analyses including single - gene correlation, functional enrichment, and immune infiltration were conducted. We used lentiviral-mediated EHF silencing in HEC-1B cells to examine EHF's impact on cell cycle, immigration, invasion, and proliferation. RESULTS: High EHF expression was linked to a more dismal prognosis of EC. The degree of tumor invasion, histologic type and stage, and clinical stage were significantly associated with EHF overexpression. Functional enrichment research conclusively indicated that EHF was closely linked to various activities, including the cell cycle, metabolic pathways, and interleukin 17 signaling pathway. The expression of EHF exhibited a negative connection with the presence of dendritic cells, natural killer (NK) cells, CD4 + type 1 T-helper cells, and the varying infiltration levels of other immune cells. In vitro study revealed increased EHF levels in endothelial cell tissues and cell lines. Analyses of functional components showed that EHF greatly enhances EC cell migration and development. CONCLUSION: Elevated EHF expression in EC patients correlated with diminished immune cell infiltration and a worse outcome. Decreasing EHF levels also affected the invasion and proliferation of EC cells. These findings highlight EHF as a putative prognostic and diagnostic biomarker for EC."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ovarian cancer significantly contributes to cancer-related deaths among women. Resistance to anchorage-dependent cell death (anoikis) plays a vital role in facilitating metastasis and worsening patient prognosis. Recent developments in the field of cancer biology have underscored the importance of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as crucial regulatory entities. However, their functions in the context of anoikis, particularly in ovarian cancer patients, remain inadequately understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of transcriptome data obtained from public databases, with a focus on screening lncRNAs associated with anoikis-related genes. A novel prognostic model that integrates risk scores to evaluate the predictive efficacy for patient outcomes was developed. We subsequently assessed the expression levels and functional role of the lncRNA BMPR1B-DT in ovarian cancer tissues through various techniques, including Western blot analysis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT‒PCR), cell counting kit-8 (CCK‒8) assays, and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Our research demonstrates that the anoikis-related lncRNA prognostic model has significant clinical value in predicting the survival outcomes of ovarian cancer patients. Additionally, our study revealed that expression of the lncRNA BMPR1B-DT is upregulated in ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. Moreover, we revealed that BMPR1B-DT promotes anoikis and inhibits proliferation under suspension culture conditions in ovarian cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that BMPR1B-DT expression is critical in the process of anoikis in ovarian cancer patients. These insights underscore the necessity for further investigations aimed at translating these findings into clinical applications to improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for ovarian cancer patients."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current evidence suggests that both higher dietary quality and consumption of an anti-inflammatory diet are associated with lower mortality risk. However, the potential interaction between dietary quality and dietary inflammation in relation to mortality risk remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the dose-response relationship between dietary quality and mortality across different levels of dietary inflammation, and their joint associations among cancer survivors. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort analysis among 2,746 cancer survivors in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Dietary quality and inflammation were assessed by Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2020 and Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) scores. Mortality outcomes were determined using National Death Index records as of December 31, 2019. Primary outcomes included all-cause, cancer, non-cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Associations were examined using restricted cubic splines (RCS), stratified and joint analyses in Cox regressions. RESULTS: During a median 79 months of follow-up, 228 cancer and 435 non-cancer deaths were recorded, with CVD being the leading cause among non-cancer deaths. In the pro-inflammatory diet group, higher dietary quality was associated with lower risks of all-cause, cancer, and non-cancer mortality. Nonlinear associations were observed for all-cause and non-cancer mortality (p for nonlinearity < 0.05). Stratified analysis showed that in the pro-inflammatory diet group, higher HEI scores were associated with lower risks of all-cause (HR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.42-0.73), cancer (HR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.33-0.99), and non-cancer mortality (HR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.37-0.80). Joint analyses indicated that cancer survivors with both a high HEI diet and anti-inflammatory diet had the lowest risks of all-cause, cancer, and non-cancer mortality. The above correlations remained significant after excluding participants who died within 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Among cancer survivors consuming a pro-inflammatory diet, higher dietary quality was significantly associated with lower mortality risk. Nonlinear dose-response relationships were observed for all-cause and non-cancer mortality. Moreover, the combination of a high HEI diet and anti-inflammatory diet was associated with the lowest mortality risk."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Identifying significantly mutated genes in tumors aids in understanding disease etiology and survival and may aid in the discovery of new drug targets. We aimed to detect and characterize mutated genes from a large, well-characterized group of colorectal cancers. METHODS: In tumor and paired normal samples from 6,111 colorectal patients, we sequenced 199 genes identified from whole exome sequencing of over 1,100 tumors. Analyses focused on non-silent mutations. We classified significantly mutated genes after stratification by hypermutation status, and estimated associations of mutated genes/pathways with disease-specific (DS)-survival using Cox regression, adjusting for age, sex, mutation burden, hypermutation status, and study while accounting for multiple comparisons (n = 4,874). RESULTS: We identified 57 genes that were significantly mutated in colorectal cancer, including 9 that were not previously reported. Among individual genes, only BRAF p.V600E mutations were significantly associated with poorer survival after correction for multiple testing (HR 1.96, P = 2.07 x 10(- 10)), with a more pronounced association among those with non-hypermutated tumors (HR 2.24, P = 1.79 x 10(- 12)). We also observed statistically significant associations with survival for four mutated pathways: TP53/ATM (HR 1.24, P = 7.96 x 10(- 4)), RTK/RAS (HR 1.33, P = 3.81 x 10(- 6)), TGF-beta (HR 1.25, P = 1.85 x 10(- 3)), and WNT (HR 0.81, P = 2.52 x 10(- 03)). CONCLUSIONS: We identified 9 significantly mutated genes, some of which are known drug targets. Among individual genes, only the BRAF p.V600E mutation was significantly associated with DS-survival, suggesting a limited survival impact from mutations driving colorectal cancer development."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and safety of suprapubic incision antegrade endoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy with preservation of the great saphenous vein and its branches in penile cancer treatment. METHODS: Between February 2023 and July 2024, penile cancer patients undergoing suprapubic incision endoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy with great saphenous vein and branch preservation were recruited from the Urology Departments of Huai'an First Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University and Xuzhou Cancer Hospital. Fifteen patients (mean age: 67.4 +/- 8.85 years) were included, all having undergone partial penectomy. Postoperative pathology confirmed tumor stages >/= T1b, and no distant metastasis was observed. In the supine position, a subcutaneous space was created under direct vision, followed by establishment of endoscopic working channels. Dissection encompassed superficial and deep inguinal lymph nodes while preserving the great saphenous vein trunk and branches. Anatomical boundaries were defined as: upper border-line between external ring upper edge and anterior superior iliac spine; outer border-line from anterior superior iliac spine to 20 cm inferior; inner border-medial thigh from pubic tubercle to 15 cm inferior; lower border-line connecting lower edges of inner and outer boundaries. RESULTS: All patients underwent successful bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy. Mean operation duration was 96 +/- 18.8 min, with mean blood loss of 41.3 +/- 16.2 ml. Average lymph node yields were 7.3 +/- 3.9 (left) and 9.5 +/- 4.4 (right). Drainage tubes were indwelling for 7.7 +/- 2.0 days, with total drainage volume of 274.7 +/- 126.4 ml, and mean hospital stay was 8.7 +/- 1.8 days. All wounds achieved grade A healing. Postoperative complications included 1 lymphocele and 1 lymphorrhea, both resolved with symptomatic management. During 9-25 months of follow-up, no cases of wound infection, subcutaneous hematoma, lower limb edema, skin necrosis, or local/distant metastasis were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Suprapubic incision antegrade endoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy with great saphenous vein and branch preservation exhibits definite therapeutic efficacy and minimal complications, justifying cautious clinical implementation."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer, often caused by persistent high-risk HPV infection, remains a significant public health challenge with limited treatment options. Chemokines play crucial roles in immune cell recruitment and tumor microenvironment modulation. This study proposes a chemokine-based predictive model to optimize personalized treatment and prognosis. METHODS: Bulk RNA-seq and clinical data from TCGA-CESC and GSE52903 cohorts were analyzed along with 152 chemokine-related genes (CRGs). Prognostic CRGs were identified via Cox regression, consensus clustering was used for subtypes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed with \"limma\". Then, a RiskScore model was developed through Lasso algorithm, and ROC curves were performed for the model performance. CIBERSORT, TIMER, MCP-counter and TIDE were used for the immune differences. Drug sensitivity was analyzed via IMvigor210 cohort and the \"oncoPredict\" package. GSEA identified enriched pathways, and single-cell RNA-seq (GSE168652) explored the special cell types in tumor and normal tissues. Finally, we examined the model gene expression by qPCR, and cell proliferation, migration and invasion through CCK-8, wound healing and trans-well assay. RESULTS: Through the analysis of the TCGA-CESC and GSE52903 cohorts, we first identified 39 prognostic CRGs and subsequently stratified cervical cancer patients into two molecular subtypes (C1/C2) based on their expression profiles. These subtypes exhibited significant differences in overall survival (C1 with a more favorable prognosis than C2) and distinct immune infiltration patterns. We then developed and validated a robust risk score model based on subtype-specific differentially expressed genes, which incorporated six genes (CXCL8, ITGA5, BACE2, CCR7, CERS4, and MEI1). Furthermore, the risk score revealed profound heterogeneity in the tumor immune microenvironment: the low-risk group was characterized by enhanced infiltration of immune cells (e.g., CD8 + T cells, activated CD4 + T cells, and M1 macrophages) and a higher predicted response to immunotherapy, whereas the high-risk group was associated with an immunosuppressive phenotype and T cell dysfunction. Mechanistically, the high-risk signature was linked to the activation of pro-tumorigenic pathways, including focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, and the IL-17 signaling pathway. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis further pinpointed the cellular origins of key model genes, revealing that CXCL8 was predominantly highly expressed in tumor-associated monocytes/macrophages. Finally, in vitro functional assays confirmed that CXCL8 was significantly upregulated in cervical cancer cells, and its knockdown potently suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a distinct chemokine-driven molecular classification and constructed a chemokine-related prognostic model for cervical cancer. These findings offer novel insights into tumor immunobiology and provide a promising tool for improving individualized risk stratification and therapeutic strategies for cervical cancer."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of adding of a pyloroplasty procedure during the performance of minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) or robotically assisted MIE (RAMIE), we conducted a prospective, phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT)(NCT03740542). BACKGROUND: Many surgeons include pyloroplasty when performing esophagectomy, but few studies have provided level 1 evidence to support or refute this step especially in the era of MIE and RAMIE. METHODS: An adaptive randomization trial design was utilized to maximize patients treated on more effective therapy and conversely minimize accrual to a less effective procedure. The trial was designed to proceed until one arm was established as superior or until a total of 140 patients had been treated and deemed evaluable for response. The primary endpoints of the study were pneumonia and/or anastomotic leak requiring surgery within 30 days of surgery. RESULTS: Over a 4-year period, 143 patients were randomized, and 134 patients were evaluable. The greater likelihood of success for pyloroplasty throughout the trial resulted in more patients randomized towards pyloroplasty (n= 90) vs. no pyloroplasty (n=44). Pneumonia or an anastomotic leak occurred in 16 of 90 (18%) patients in the pyloroplasty arm vs. 12 of 44 (27%) in the no-pyloroplasty arm. The stopping criteria were met when the posterior probability of pyloroplasty being superior reached 90%. CONCLUSIONS: The design of this trial led to early stopping because the short-term results indicated that outcomes in the pyloroplasty arm were superior to the no-pyloroplasty arm. This RCT provides evidence for short-term benefits of adding pyloroplasty to MIE or RAMIE. The long-term outcomes and quality of life measures continue to be monitored."

METHODS: The EOC patients treated at our institute from January 2014 to March 2021 were included. Gene mutations were detected using 24 target HRR genes. The associations between HRR gene mutations and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 318 patients were evaluated, 37 patients had BRCA, and 21 patients had other HRR gene mutations. EOC patients with HRR gene mutations were associated with platinum sensitivity than wild type (82.8% vs. 68.7%, p=0.033), and it remained significant in patients with advanced stage (79.5% vs. 57.6%, p=0.007), serous carcinoma (89.4% vs. 66.2%, p=0.002) or optimal debulking surgery (97.1% vs. 79.1%, p=0.013). In serous carcinoma, advanced stage (hazard ratio [HR]=2.11; p=0.031), HRR mutation (HR=0.62; p=0.021) and 1st line poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi, HR=0.28; p<0.001) were significant for cancer recurrence. Suboptimal debulking surgery (HR=1.58; p=0.044) and HRR gene mutation (HR=0.33; p=0.001) were important for cancer-related death. In non-serous carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma (HR=3.91; p=0.023), advanced stage (HR=3.10; p<0.001) and suboptimal debulking surgery (HR=2.63; p=0.001) were significant for cancer recurrence. Mucinous carcinoma (HR=9.17; p=0.001), advanced stage (HR=4.26; p<0.001), and suboptimal debulking surgery (HR=3.80; p<0.001) were important for cancer-related death. CONCLUSION: HRR gene mutations were associated with platinum sensitivity, PARPi response and favorable survival in serous EOC patients. In non-serous EOC, HRR gene mutations did not show the same trend, which warrants further investigation."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Combining cisplatin and gemcitabine (CG) in the concurrent and adjuvant treatment phase of advanced cervical cancer has improved oncological outcome at the cost of excess toxicity. We aimed to investigate the feasibility and safety of this treatment intensification in the era of modern radiotherapy. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on patients treated with definitive chemoradiation including CG for advanced cervical cancer. Treatment consisted of chemoradiotherapy (weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m(2) and gemcitabine 125 mg/m(2) with volumetric-modulated arc therapy) followed by image-guided adaptive brachytherapy and 2 cycles of adjuvant CG. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were included with a median follow-up of 48 months (range, 7-130). Patients with FIGO stage IIIC1 accounted for 49.1% of cases, with an additional 23.6% being stage IIIC2. The median number of concurrent gemcitabine and cisplatin administrations was 4 (range, 1-6), and 5 (range, 2-8), respectively. Forty-four patients (80%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. Hematological severe short-term toxicity (grade >/=3) occurred in 22 patients (43.1%). There was no deviation from planned radiotherapy-schedule. No treatment-related death occurred. Five patients experienced late grade >/=3 adverse events. Local, locoregional and distant control rates at 5 years were 82.0%, 70.5% and 69.3%, respectively. Five-year progression-free survival was 50.9% and overall survival was 70.9%. CONCLUSION: Concurrent chemoradiation with CG followed by image-guided adaptive brachytherapy and adjuvant CG is feasible and associated with a lower toxicity profile than previously reported. Further research is needed to refine patient selection for different treatment intensification strategies in advanced cervical cancer."

As most early-stage cases are diagnosed at stage IB, this study aims to investigate the prognostic factors and optimal management for stage IB uLMS. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of medical records for patients who underwent surgical intervention and were diagnosed with stage IB uLMS at the Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center from January 1, 2006, to August 31, 2023. RESULTS: After a median follow-up time of 70.1 months (range: 2.3-234.1), we observed a median disease-free survival (DFS) of 18 months and overall survival (OS) of 67.9 months, respectively. Median DFS was 14.7 months in the observation group and 18.4 months in the adjuvant chemotherapy group. Median OS was 75.4 months in the observation group and 66.6 months in the adjuvant chemotherapy group. Five-year DFS rates were 14.1% and 15.7%, and OS rates were 66.5% and 54.1% for the observation and chemotherapy groups, respectively. Poor DFS was associated with age >48 years, postmenopausal status, tumor size >12 cm, elevated Ki-67 levels, and lymphadenectomy, but these factors did not correlate with OS outcomes. No significant DFS or OS differences were found between chemotherapy and observation groups or across chemotherapy regimens. Ovarian preservation did not affect prognosis. CONCLUSION: Age >48 years, postmenopausal status, larger tumor size, higher Ki-67, and lymphadenectomy predicted poor DFS but not OS in stage IB uLMS. Ovarian preservation is safe. Adjuvant chemotherapy with different regimens showed no significant survival benefits."

Analyzing data from the cancer registry database will help understand the situation and trends of these diseases. METHODS: This study utilized data from Thailand's population-based cancer registries covering 16 provinces across 5 geographic regions between 2019 and 2021. Data collection included demographic characteristics, cancer incidence, histopathology, disease stage, and survival outcomes. Incidence rates were calculated using age-standardized rates (ASRs) per 100,000 population, and 5-year survival outcomes were compared across 2 time periods (2013-2017 vs. 2018-2022). RESULTS: During 2019-2021, Thailand recorded a mean annual ASR of 132.9 for females, with cervical cancer remaining the most common gynecologic cancer. The incidence of cervical cancer decreased from 19.5 per 100,000 in 1995-2000 to 10.3 per 100,000 in 2019-2021. Uterine cancer demonstrated a rising trend, from 3.6 per 100,000 in 2004-2006 to 6.1 per 100,000 in 2019-2021, while ovarian cancer incidence remained relatively stable at 5.9 per 100,000. Five-year survival rates improved significantly across all gynecologic cancers in 2018-2022 compared with 2013-2017. The hazard ratios for overall survival by stage ranged from 0.57 to 0.81 for cervical, 0.53 to 0.82 for uterine, and 0.57 to 0.81 for ovarian cancers (all p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The incidence of cervical cancer in Thailand has declined over the past 2 decades, while the burdens of uterine and ovarian cancers are increasing.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of ultrasound-guided RISS block on postoperative analgesia and diaphragmatic excursion (DE) after video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for lung cancer. METHODS: One hundred patients who underwent VATS lung resection participated in this study and were randomized to a RISS group (Group R) or a control group (Group C). Group R underwent ultrasound-guided RISS block with 0.25% ropivacaine hydrochloride 0.5 ml/kg immediately after surgery. Group C was given standard general anaesthesia, and patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) was used in the postoperative period in both groups. The visual analogue scores (VAS) at rest and during movement at 2 hours(h), 24 h, and 48 h postoperatively were used as the primary outcome measures. Secondary outcomes included postoperative consumption of sufentanil; preoperative and postoperative left and right-sided DE during calm and deep breathing, and the occurrence of adverse effects such as postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), dizziness, somnolence, puncture site infection, and hematoma. RESULTS: At 2 h, 24 h, and 48 h postoperatively, patients in Group R had lower VAS scores at rest (median [Q1, Q3]: 1.00 [1.00, 1.00]; 1.00 [1.00, 1.00]; 0.00 [0.00, 1.00]) and during movement (2.00 [2.00, 3.00]; 2.00 [2.00, 2.00]; 2.00 [1.00, 2.00]) than those in Group C (resting: 2.00 [2.00, 2.00]; 2.00 [2.00, 2.00]; 1.00 [1.00, 2.00]; movement: 3.00 [3.00, 4.00]; 3.00 [3.00, 4.00]; 3.00 [2.00, 4.00]) (all P < 0.0001). Sufentanil consumption at 2 h, 24 h, and 48 h postoperatively was also significantly lower in Group R (P = 0.0002, P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001). Preoperatively, no significant difference in DE existed between the groups (P > 0.05). At 30 min post-extubation and 2 h and 24 h postoperatively, during both calm and deep breathing on both sides, Group R had significantly greater DE than Group C (P < 0.05). At 48 h postoperatively, the right-sided DE during calm breathing showed no significant difference between the groups. PONV incidences did not differ significantly (P = 0.2662), and Group R had less dizziness, somnolence, higher satisfaction post-surgery, and showed no cases of puncture site infection or hematoma. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-guided RISS block can modestly reduce postoperative pain in patients undergoing VATS, with clinically relevant benefits, and may help alleviate diaphragmatic dysfunction caused by surgical or anesthetic factors. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at the China Clinical Trial Registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn, ChiCTR2300070842) on 24/04/2023."

The cytotoxic evaluation revealed higher activity towards leukemia cancer cell lines (K562 and HL-60) than solid tumor cells (HeLa and MCF-7). The compound 10 h, containing a benzyl group, showed the most prominent activity against K562 cells, and the lowest toxicity towards healthy cells among all active derivatives. The most active compounds 10f, 10 h, and 12 h were further investigated and induced a significant increase in the percentage of HeLa, K562, and HL-60 cells in the subG1 cell cycle phase in comparison with the control cells. Compounds 10f and 10 h activated apoptosis in K562 cells through all three tested caspases, while derivative 12 h only induced the activation of the main effector caspase-3. Molecular docking simulations suggest that these compounds can form stable complexes with caspase-3, consistent with their experimentally confirmed involvement in caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways. All three tested derivatives demonstrated moderate to strong binding to bovine serum albumin (BSA), with preferential occupation of subdomain IIA (site I), as supported both experimentally and through docking studies. The interaction study of these compounds with DNA indicated their ability to interact with ct-DNA through the minor groove."

This review has explored the significant function of circulating miRNAs as promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for lung cancer. Integration of miRNA profiles with clinical parameters has shown potential in predicting treatment responses and patient outcomes. Nevertheless, obstacles persist in standardizing the protocols for isolating and quantifying miRNAs, along with the variability of miRNA expression across various cancer types and stages.

    "abstract": "Polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) are crucial mediators of tumor-induced immunosuppression, while their heterogeneity and spatial dynamics across malignancies remain poorly understood. By integrating single-cell RNA sequencing data from 576 samples across 19 cancer types and spatial transcriptomics data from three distinct malignancies, we identified a PMN-MDSC population. This cell population demonstrated characteristic upregulation of immunosuppressive genes and was associated with poor prognosis across multiple cancer cohorts. Notably, TREM1 was highly expressed in PMN-MDSCs and may mediate immunosuppressive processes. Multiplex immunofluorescence demonstrated that TREM1(+) PMN-MDSCs exhibited significantly higher distribution in tumor regions compared to non-tumor tissues. Spatial transcriptomics analysis revealed their co-localization with fibroblasts and exhausted T cells. Moreover, CellChat analysis showed that TREM1(+) PMN-MDSCs remodeled the tumor microenvironment through interactions with diverse cellular components. Collectively, our study revealed the conserved immunosuppressive features and spatial interaction networks of TREM1(+) PMN-MDSCs from a pan-cancer perspective, highlighting TREM1 as a pivotal therapeutic target to disrupt PMN-MDSC-mediated tumor immune evasion."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of MRI in detecting residual disease after conization in patients with early-stage cervical cancer (CC) and to evaluate the impact of MRI on FIGO staging and surgical management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2018 and December 2023, a consecutive series of patients with early-stage invasive CC undergoing conization, pre-operative pelvic MRI, and surgery were included in this retrospective study. Two experienced radiologists reviewed the MRI scans for the presence of residual tumor, assessed on T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and contrast-enhanced sequences, if available. MRI findings were compared with surgical pathology to evaluate diagnostic performance and clinical impact. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients were included in the study. MRI detected residual disease with an accuracy of 78.7% (95% CI 71.0-86.4), sensitivity of 66%, specificity of 90.9%, positive predictive value of 87.5%, and negative predictive value of 73.5%. The use of contrast agent showed no significant difference in overall accuracy, with an accuracy of 74.5% for contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) and 83% for non-CE-MRI (p = 0.28), respectively. MRI correctly staged 73.8% of cases, suggested the correct extent of radicality in 79.7% of cases following the 2018 ESGO guidelines, and the appropriate type of hysterectomy (simple vs. radical) in 90.9% of cases following the SHAPE study. CONCLUSION: Non-CE MRI is a reliable and sufficient tool for detecting residual tumor after conization in early-stage CC, as contrast administration offers no additional diagnostic value. Accurate pre-operative identification of residual disease may refine FIGO staging and assist in tailoring surgical strategies. KEY POINTS: Question MRI evaluation of residual tumor after cervical conization in early-stage cervical cancer is critical to optimize surgical planning noninvasively and avoid overtreatment. Findings MRI correctly identified residual disease with high specificity (90.9%) and moderate sensitivity (66%); contrast enhancement did not significantly improve diagnostic accuracy. Clinical relevance MRI, particularly non-contrast protocols, reliably excludes post-conization residual disease and aids in selecting appropriate surgical treatment, reducing overtreatment in early-stage cervical cancer."

Oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) is the guideline-recommended primary method of nutritional support for this population; however, its effectiveness is often undermined by low compliance among them. This study sought to investigate the needs and preferences of people with CRC in the postoperative period regarding ONS, offering a theoretical foundation for enhancing compliance from the perspective of participants' preferences. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted, involving semi-structured interviews with 14 people with CRC in the postoperative period at a tertiary hospital in Xiamen, China, from March to April 2025. Data analysis integrated unstructured observational data with details of the oral nutritional supplements and ONS regimens used by participants, and the research team employed thematic analysis to synthesize the findings. RESULTS: Two primary themes emerged, encompassing seven subthemes: (1) Demands and preferences for oral nutritional supplements: Participants valued portability, practicality, standardization, scientific validity, and clear labeling; they also sought improved cost-effectiveness or reimbursement via medical insurance, rapid and significant nutritional support effects, and a preference for disease-specific formulas. (2) Demands and preferences for ONS regimens: Participants emphasized credibility, alignment with personal habits and preferences, and the provision of education and guidance. CONCLUSION: People with CRC in the postoperative period reported suboptimal experiences with ONS, exhibited notable misconceptions about its use, and indicated that current regimens failed to address their treatment needs and preferences. Clinicians should adopt a person-centered approach, designing ONS regimens tailored to their preferences to improve acceptance and compliance."

However, its functions in Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that in human ESCC cells, TRIM21 facilitates the K63-linked ubiquitination dependent translocation of ALKBH5 from cytosol to nucleus and augments its m6A demethylase activity. LIAS mRNA was demethylated by ALKBH5, and then further identified by reader IGF2BP3, which comprehensively caused the lower expression of LIAS. Moreover, O-GlcNAc transferase OGT facilitated TRIM21-mediated K63-ubiquitination of ALKBH5. Combined treatment with an OGT inhibitor OSMI-1 and copper ionophore elesclomol eliminates tumor growth and remarkably enhances the sensitivity of tumor cells to cisplatin. Together, our study identifies TRIM21 Ubiquitinated-ALKBH5 as a critical gatekeeper to restrict cuproptosis, and such mechanism may contribute to tumor development and drug resistance in ESCC."

    "abstract": "This work evaluated the action of hsa_circ_0000520 in breast cancer (BC) progression through miR-542-3p/TMBIM6 axis. Clinical specimens were harvested from BC patients, in which hsa_circ_0000520 expression was determined. BT-549 cells were taken for transfection to intervene gene expression correspondingly, after which cellular proliferative, invasive, migratory, and apoptotic activities were monitored. As well, under different treatment, the changes in relevant indicators were observed. A tumor model was established in mice to examine the action of hsa_circ_0000520. Mechanistic analysis using RIP and lufiferase reporter assay were conducted to verify the interaction between miR-542-3p and hsa_circ_0000520 or TMBIM6. hsa_circ_0000520 was elevated in its expression in BC tissues. hsa_circ_0000520 knockdown exerted an anti-tumor property to fight against cellular malignant phenotypes in vitro, as well as tumor development in vivo. hsa_circ_0000520, through an absorption effect, regulated miR-542-3p, thereby targeting TMBIM6. miR-542-3p upregulation or TMBIM6 downregulation counter-balanced the pro-tumor effects of hsa_circ_0000520 overexpression. hsa_circ_0000520 promotes BC proliferation and metastasis through miR-542-3p-targeted TMBIM6."

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) features a dense desmoplastic stroma, limiting drug delivery and promoting chemoresistance. While anti-angiogenic strategies have shown limited success, underexplored pro-angiogenic approaches may improve perfusion and treatment efficacy. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and demonstrates anti-cancer effects at longer treatments and pro-healing, angiogenic effects at shorter treatments. We investigated the impact of short CAP treatment on angiogenesis in PDAC using a triple co-culture spheroid model and a turkey in ovo model, mimicking the tumor microenvironment. CAP was applied via the kINPen MED for 15-60 s in vitro and 10-30 s in ovo. In vitro, CAP inhibited endothelial tube formation treatment time-dependently and reduced VEGF-A secretion, while other angiogenic factors remained unchanged. In ovo, vascularization around the tumor was slightly increased in the BH tumors, while not significantly altered within the tumors, except for a significant reduction after 30 s of CAP treatment. Additionally, a significant increase in tumor weight was observed following short CAP treatment. These findings suggest that under standard conditions, short CAP treatment preserves vascular quiescence in PDAC and may exert subtle tumor-modulating effects, highlighting the importance of treatment parameters and model complexity in CAP-based therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which mediates transcriptional repression through histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), is highly expressed in aggressive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, despite the elevated EZH2 expression, H3K27me3 levels remain unexpectedly low, suggesting a potential noncanonical role for EZH2 in TNBC. Here we demonstrate that EZH2 directly binds to the transcription factor E2F1, and this interaction is critical for modulating chromatin accessibility by disrupting H3K27me3 deposition. This noncanonical function of EZH2, which operates independently of its methyltransferase activity, is linked to enhanced tumor cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. Our findings reveal that EZH2 functions in a chromatin context-dependent manner by cooperating with E2F1 in TNBC, highlighting that the EZH2-E2F1 interaction, independent of PRC2, plays a key role in remodeling chromatin structure and facilitating TNBC proliferation."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: As cancer incidence increases, internal medicine (IM) physicians play a growing role in managing the complex medical needs of cancer patients and survivors across the care continuum. However, few residency programs offer structured training in supportive oncology care. We developed a combined Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) Onco-Medicine Track to equip IM residents with skills in cancer prevention, survivorship, symptom management, and interdisciplinary care. METHODS: This 3-year residency track launched in 2015 through a partnership between BCM and MDACC. Residents complete approximately one-third of their training in cancer-focused IM rotations, including onco-hospital medicine, palliative care, supportive care, and subspecialty experiences. Program development was informed by a feasibility assessment and modeled in part on career pathways at the University of California, San Francisco. RESULTS: As of 2024, the program has trained 35 graduates, 57% of whom pursued oncology-related careers. Board pass rates and in-training exam scores for track residents were comparable to peers. Resident evaluations emphasized the educational value of rotations focused on cancer screening, managing treatment-related complications, and improving communication skills as well as survivorship-focused competencies. Graduates have received national recognition through awards, presentations, and leadership roles. Demand remains strong, with consistent NRMP match fills and high applicant volumes. CONCLUSIONS: The BCM-MDACC Onco-Medicine Track demonstrates a sustainable and scalable model for preparing internists in supportive cancer care and survivorship. Its integrated structure may inform similar efforts at other institutions, even those without access to a comprehensive cancer center."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Although rare, septic shock can develop following the closure of an ileostomy created during colorectal cancer surgery. In such cases, bacterial translocation (BT) is considered the primary diagnosis, and appropriate treatment is provided. Herein, we investigated the risk factors of BT following ileostomy closure after colorectal cancer surgery. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted using the colorectal cancer database of Nagasaki University, focusing on 91 patients who received ileostomy closure after colorectal cancer surgery. The patients were divided into two groups based on the occurrence of BT, defined as fever exceeding 38  degrees C without an identifiable cause, and data regarding patient background, surgical factors, and postoperative factors were assessed. RESULTS: BT occurred in 12 of 91 patients. No significant differences were observed between the groups of patients in terms of background factors but C-reactive protein levels on postoperative days 3 and 7 were significantly higher in the BT group than in the non-BT group (BT group vs. non-BT group [median], day 3: 6.64 mg/dL vs. 3.79 mg/dL, p = 0.0026; day 7: 5.10 mg/dL vs. 1.52 mg/dL, p = 0.0007). Additionally, the rate of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy administration was significantly higher in the BT than in the non-BT group (BT group vs. non-BT group: 83.3% vs. 43.0%, p = 0.0123). The pathological findings from resected specimens showed that mucosal height was lower in the anal side than in the oral side. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant chemotherapy may significantly increase the risk of BT after ileostomy closure following colorectal cancer surgery."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is associated with a high symptom burden that negatively impacts daily functioning and quality of life. A better understanding of the time course and relationships between these constructs can help tailor rehabilitation interventions in the context of disease progression. The objectives were to describe and compare the trajectories in mobility, participation, and symptom burden and to assess associations and explore predictors of mobility change. METHODS: Secondary data analysis of a longitudinal cohort study of 110 participants with NSCLC. Mobility and participation were measured using the WHODAS 2.0 subdomains, and symptom burden was measured using the POS-S. Data at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 months were analysed using repeated measures ANOVA and regression models. Change scores were compared over time, and multiple linear regression identified predictors of mobility change. RESULTS: Overall, mobility and symptom burden remained stable, whilst participation scores showed improvement at 4 and 6 months (p < 0.05). Both improvements and declines in mobility status were correlated with changes in participation (r = 0.297-0.462, p < 0.001) and symptom burden (r = 0.151-0.368, p < 0.05). Baseline symptom burden was a significant predictor of mobility change, even after adjusting for demographic and clinical variables (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Improvements in participation despite stable mobility and symptom burden suggest an adaptive response and/or benefit from care. Mobility, related to both symptom burden and participation, offers a functional indicator that could be used to focus rehabilitation in advanced NSCLC."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Shape-sensing robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (ssRAB) combined with intraoperative imaging optimizes tool-lesion relationship during the sampling of focal pulmonary lesions. Nevertheless, confirmation of tool-in-lesion status is not equivalent to diagnostic sampling. This gap may be bridged by the addition of transbronchial cryobiopsy (TBCB) to traditional transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) and forceps biopsy (TBFB); however, the performance of TBCB, specifically with the 1.7-mm cryoprobe, has raised significant safety concerns. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the safety of TBCB using the 1.7-mm cryoprobe, added into ssRAB-guided TBNA and TBFB, and performed via a protocolized approach in a cancer center patient population undergoing lung biopsy for focal parenchymal pulmonary lesions. Secondary endpoints included diagnostic yield, accuracy, and TBFB vs. TBCB tissue quality measures. METHODS: This prospective, single center, single arm study, enrolled patients referred for sampling of focal pulmonary parenchymal lesions. All procedures were performed with image-guided ssRAB with prophylactic balloon occlusion. The primary endpoint was a safety composite of grade >/= 2 bleeding, grade >/= 2 pneumothorax, or other biopsy-related grade >/= 3 complication. Secondary endpoints included conservative diagnostic yield, diagnostic accuracy for malignancy, and biopsy specimen quality measures. RESULTS: Fifty-one participants were enrolled and underwent image-guided ssRAB. The primary severe adverse event rate was 0% (95% CI 0.0-7.9). The conservative diagnostic yield was 92% and the diagnostic accuracy for malignancy was 90%. TBCB was superior to forceps biopsy in measures of total specimen dimensions, diagnostic tissue area, and degree of crush artifact (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). CONCLUSION: In cancer patients with localized parenchymal lung lesions, the incorporation of a rigorous safety protocol into image-guided ssRAB allows for the safe acquisition of high-quality peripheral lung TBCB specimen, utilizing the 1.7-mm cryoprobe.

It plays a crucial role in various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and organ failure. This review systematically explores the key mechanisms underlying ferroptosis, including polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipid (PUFA-PL) peroxidation, iron metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, we summarize major endogenous ferroptosis defense systems, including the SLC7A11-glutathione (GSH)-glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) axis, the ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1)-ubiquinol (CoQH(2)) system, the mitochondrial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH)-CoQH(2) pathway, and the guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1)-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) pathway, which act as critical brakes on ferroptosis. Furthermore, we discuss various small-molecule inhibitors targeting ferroptosis, categorized by their mechanisms of action, including iron chelators, lipid peroxidation inhibitors, antioxidants, and regulatory pathway modulators. Recent advances in pharmacological strategies and their potential therapeutic applications are also highlighted."

    "abstract": "Nucleophosmin (NPM1), a nucleolar protein frequently mutated in hematopoietic malignancies, is overexpressed in several solid tumors with poorly understood functional roles. Here, we demonstrate that Npm1 is upregulated after APC loss in WNT-responsive tissues and supports WNT-driven intestinal and liver tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, NPM1 loss induces ribosome pausing and accumulation at the 5'-end of coding sequences, triggering a protein synthesis stress response and p53 activation, which mediate this antitumorigenic effect. Collectively, our data identify NPM1 as a critical WNT effector that sustains WNT-driven hyperproliferation and tumorigenesis by attenuating the integrated stress response and p53 activation. Notably, NPM1 expression correlates with elevated WNT signaling and proliferation in human colorectal cancer (CRC), while CRCs harboring NPM1 deletions exhibit preferential TP53 inactivation, underscoring the clinical relevance of our findings. Being dispensable for adult epithelial homeostasis, NPM1 represents a promising therapeutic target in p53-proficient WNT-driven tumors, including treatment-refractory KRAS-mutant CRC, and hepatic cancers."

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer poses a significant threat to women's health. Although folic acid (FA) has been recognized as a protective factor in cervical carcinogenesis, its precise molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify Dickkopf Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor 3 (DKK3), an inhibitor of the Wnt signaling pathway, as a potential target of FA. This study provides systematic evidence that DKK3 expression decreases during cervical squamous epithelial carcinogenesis, showing progressive downregulation from squamous intraepithelial lesions to squamous cell carcinoma, which correlates with advanced FIGO stage and lymphovascular space invasion. Functional assays confirmed DKK3's tumor-suppressive role and therapeutic potential. DKK3 overexpression downregulated beta-catenin protein levels and inhibited malignant behavior in SiHa cells, whereas its knockdown produced opposite effects. Notably, this study demonstrated for the first time that FA intervention upregulated DKK3 expression, suppressed Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, leading to a reduction in beta-catenin protein abundance, and exerted potent anti-tumor effects-suppressing proliferation, migration, and invasion while promoting apoptosis. Even under DKK3-knockdown conditions, FA intervention partially reversed beta-catenin accumulation by enhancing residual DKK3 expression. Overall, this study establishes the prognostic and interventional value of DKK3 in cervical squamous epithelial carcinogenesis. FA intervention may serve as an effective strategy to restore DKK3 expression to inhibit the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, thereby exerting antitumor activity. Future cervical cancer prevention and treatment strategies may benefit from dynamic monitoring of DKK3 expression to identify potential beneficiaries and provide targeted FA intervention."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a high-sensitivity, multimode graphene-based metamaterial (MM) biosensor for refractive index sensing, featuring a periodic array of gold (Au) double-split elliptical resonators (DSERs) on a graphene-coated silicon dioxide (SiO(2)) substrate with an Au reflective base layer. The proposed design is analyzed using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. The unique double-split elliptical geometry significantly enhances electromagnetic field confinement and enables the excitation of multiple distinct resonance modes, outperforming conventional circular or rectangular resonators that typically support only single- or dual-mode responses. The novelty of this work lies in the integration of a graphene-metal hybrid structure that combines tunable plasmonic properties of graphene with strong localized surface plasmon resonances of DSERs, resulting in multimode operation, improved tunability, and superior sensing performance. The bottom gold layer effectively suppresses transmission and reinforces field confinement within the active region. The sensor operates across 650-1500 nm, supporting five well-separated resonance modes that provide multiple sensing channels, enhancing detection efficiency and spectral flexibility. Optimized structural parameters such as the Au array thickness, SiO(2) layer thickness, and resonator width further improve its performance. The biosensor achieves a maximum sensitivity of 714.28 nm/RIU, a figure of merit (FoM) of 51.02 1/RIU, and a quality factor (QF) of 73.42 for breast cancer cell detection. Moreover, it successfully distinguishes between normal and cancerous cells (basal, breast, and cervical), demonstrating its strong potential for biomedical diagnostics and optical sensing applications. These results position the proposed multimode graphene-based biosensor as a promising platform for next-generation photonic and biomedical sensing technologies."

In the Elgon sub-region, Rhoicissus tridentata extracts are traditionally used to treat prostate cancer, but the absence of standardized dosages restricts their potential use and limits evidence for informing chemotherapeutic applications. This study aimed to investigate the subacute toxicity of R. tridentata extracts in Wistar albino rats. We used 84 Wistar albino rats to assess clinical toxicity symptoms, hematological and biochemical parameters, and histopathological changes using advanced equipment like hematology machines and COBAS INTEGRA Chemistry Plus 600. A total of 84 Wistar albino rats were used to assess clinical symptoms, hematological, biochemical parameters and majar organ histopathological changes. Histological biomarkers were analyzed using Coulter Counter Hamatology analyzer while biochemical indices were analyzed using COBAS INTEGRA Chemistry Plus 600, but eosinophils increased significantly (p </= 0.0001), confirming mild toxicity. To guarantee the safe use of R. tridentata in therapy, determining the maximum dose that produces no adverse effects (NOAEL) is essential to inform dosing in sub-chronic and sub-acute toxicity. Regulatory agencies evaluating herbal products containing R. tridentata should exercise caution and require standardized dosing protocols and comprehensive toxicity assessments to safeguard public health."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is estimated that approximately 80% of childhood cancer cases occur in resource-limited settings and that most unvaccinated children live in middle-income countries. This creates an overlap of burdens for children with cancer, who are especially vulnerable to vaccine-preventable infections such as influenza and invasive pneumococcal disease. Given the complexity of vaccinating children with cancer because of the multidisciplinary care they require, it is unclear how such vaccination is achieved in these settings. METHODS: A self-administered, anonymized, cross-sectional survey was distributed to providers of healthcare for children with cancer in Latin America and the Caribbean through a contact list of 3236 email addresses. A total of 378 participant responses were included in the final analysis. This study used the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to understand the implementation factors influencing the vaccination of children with cancer in Latin America and the Caribbean. RESULTS: Most respondents (n = 246, 65.3%) reported that vaccines were always, almost always, or often available for administration at their institution - and were willing to recommend children with cancer for vaccination. Most respondents reported receiving no training or education on immunizing children with cancer at their current institution (n = 297, 78.6%) or before joining it (n = 242, 64.0%). Furthermore, only a small minority reported working in institutions with written policies on vaccinating children with cancer (n = 53, 14.0%) or clinical guidelines (n = 97, 25.7%) for vaccinating these patients. Respondents estimated that most pediatric patients with cancer at their hospital were not up to date on childhood immunizations and did not receive the annual influenza vaccine. Although most respondents (n = 345, 91.3%) reported that their government provides funding for childhood vaccinations, fewer than half (n = 183, 48.5%) reported that government funding was available for re-immunizing children with cancer. CONCLUSIONS: We found a clear willingness to recommend vaccines for children with cancer in Latin America and the Caribbean, a trend not found in similar studies in the literature. Our findings support the notion that interventions to improve vaccination for children with cancer should gear their efforts towards building an institutional culture that prioritizes immunization for both patients and staff and that supports providers in their already established practice of recommending vaccines to their patients."

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer is estimated to contribute to over 35,000 deaths of men residing in the United States, with the majority fatality due to metastatic disease. CDC7 is a kinase that regulates DNA replication and is found elevated during neuroendocrine transdifferentiation in lung and prostate cancer. In this study, we demonstrate that CDC7 is highly expressed in treatment-resistant prostate cancer, with even higher levels observed in treatment-resistant prostate cancer with neuroendocrine phenotype (NEPC). We further identify CDC7 as a critical regulator of prostate tumorigenesis. Downregulation of CDC7 significantly reduces prostate cancer cells growth and invasion in vitro and silencing CDC7 suppresses prostate tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the inhibition of CDC7 using TAK-931, a selective CDC7 inhibitor, significantly reduces the proliferation, migration, and invasion of aggressive prostate cancer cells. TAK-931 treated prostate cancer cells exhibit an abnormal cell cycle profile, suggesting that CDC7 inhibition induces replication stress and promotes apoptosis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CDC7 is a regulator of tumor progression in prostate cancer and represents new therapeutic target in advanced prostate cancer."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by its aggressive clinical behavior and propensity for distant metastasis, presents critical challenges in therapeutic management. Emerging evidence implicates lipid metabolic reprogramming as a key facilitator of tumor progression and metastatic dissemination. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying lipid metabolic dysregulation in TNBC metastasis remain poorly characterized. Our work systematically elucidates the mechanistic role of ALDH3A2 in orchestrating lipid metabolic adaptations that drive breast cancer metastasis. METHODS: Transcriptomic analysis of clinical datasets identified metastasis-related metabolic regulators. Cellular migration/invasion assays and murine metastasis models were utilized to assess metastatic effects of ALDH3A2. Lipidomic profiling coupled with pathway analysis characterized metabolic alterations. Mechanistic studies integrated western blot analysis with lipid droplet quantification. Computational approaches including structure-based virtual screening and molecular docking simulations were employed for inhibitor discovery. RESULTS: ALDH3A2 was significantly upregulated in TNBC clinical specimens and showed significant association with adverse clinical outcomes. Functional validation confirmed that ALDH3A2 potentiates TNBC cell migration/invasion through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) activation. Metabolic profiling revealed ALDH3A2-driven lipid accumulation, evidenced by increased lipid droplet formation and elevated triglyceride levels. Specifically, arachidonic acid (AA) enrichment was observed in ALDH3A2-overexpressing cells, corresponding to enhanced glycerophospholipid metabolism. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that ALDH3A2-mediated AMP/ATP imbalance suppresses AMPK phosphorylation while activating mTOR/SREBP1 signaling. mTOR inhibition effectively attenuated ALDH3A2-induced lipid metabolic alterations. Importantly, oxaliplatin was identified as a potential therapeutic agent targeting ALDH3A2-mediated AA metabolism to suppress metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Our work establishes ALDH3A2 as a pivotal regulator of lipid metabolic reprogramming in TNBC metastasis, providing mechanistic insights into AA-mediated tumor progression. These findings position ALDH3A2 as a promising therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker for TNBC management."

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 288 pancreatic cancer patients who underwent radical pancreatectomy between June 2012 and June 2024. The collected data included demographic characteristics, pathological findings, and laboratory results. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify potential factors associated with the occurrence of MI. The Kaplan-Meier method was employed to estimate disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to assess the impact of various factors on patient prognosis. RESULTS: Among 288 patients, MI was detected in 93 patients (32.3%). Positive microvasculature biomarkers, positive regional lymph nodes (RNP), poor differentiation grade, and reduced MCV might be independent risk factors for MI. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that MI, tumor site, RNP, grade, chemotherapy, chloride (Cl) and thrombin time were independent risk factors for DFS and OS. Among 93 patients with MI, no statistically significant difference in prognosis was observed between the MVI and LVI subtypes. CONCLUSION: Positive microvasculature biomarkers, positive RNP, poor histological grade, and reduced MCV levels might serve as independent risk factors for the development of MI. The presence of MI was independent risk factors for DFS and OS. However, no significant prognostic association was observed between the specific origin of invasion (whether MVI or LVI)."

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the predominant stromal cell population within the TME, play pivotal roles in these processes through their remarkable phenotypic and functional heterogeneity. Emerging evidence underscores the diversity in the origins, phenotypes, and functions of CAFs, highlighting their ability to adaptively influence tumor biology in a context-dependent manner. CAFs facilitate cancer malignancy via multiple interconnected mechanisms, including the secretion of soluble bioactive factors, the release of exosomes, the metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells, the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and the modulation of the immune microenvironment. CAFs have emerged as attractive and viable therapeutic targets. Recent efforts have focused on developing therapies that disrupt the protumorigenic activities of CAFs or reprogram them toward tumor-suppressive phenotypes. Several of these strategies have shown promise and are advancing into clinical trials. In this review, we comprehensively discuss recent advancements in our understanding of the heterogeneity of CAFs, elucidate their multifaceted interactions within the TME, and explore novel therapeutic strategies targeting CAFs across various cancer types. Our review aims to foster the translation of preclinical insights into clinically effective interventions targeting CAFs."

Consequently, the significance of cancer cell-intrinsic ITGB2 in solid tumor progression and therapy has not been rigorously evaluated. METHODS: We leveraged single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing, real-time quantitative PCR, multiplex immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, immunoblotting, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1-dependent adhesion and proliferation assays to uncover melanoma cell-intrinsic ITGB2 functional expression, association with clinical tumor progression, activation, protumorigenic signaling, adhesive and proliferative functions utilizing patient melanoma biospecimens, established human and murine melanoma lines. In vivo tumorigenicity studies in immunocompromised NOD/SCID interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain null (NSG), immunocompetent wildtype, and Icam1 knockout (KO) C57BL/6 mice were performed to dissect melanoma-ITGB2 downstream pathway activity and functions in tumor growth and metastasis. The cancer cell-intrinsic ITGB2 axis was targeted using CRISPR/Cas9-based Itgb2 KO, blocking ITGB2 antibodies, ITGB2-activating CD44 crosslinking, and pharmacologic inhibition of ITGB2-dependent Wnt signaling using LGK974, zamaporvint, and FDA-approved pyrvinium pamoate repurposed for cancer therapy. RESULTS: This work demonstrates nonhematopoietic expression and protumorigenic functions of ITGB2 intrinsic to melanoma cells. Tumor cell-ITGB2 mediated adhesion to ICAM-1, promoted cancer progression in preclinical melanoma models, was enriched in clinical metastatic versus primary melanomas or benign nevi, and predicted sentinel lymph node metastasis in patients with primary disease. Consistently, inhibition of melanoma cell-intrinsic ITGB2 using blocking antibodies or Itgb2 gene KO potently suppressed ICAM-1-mediated melanoma cell adhesion, tumor growth, and metastatic dissemination. Melanoma cell-ITGB2:ICAM-1 interaction activated downstream Wnt signaling, the pharmacologic inhibition of which suppressed melanoma-ITGB2-mediated tumorigenesis. CONCLUSIONS: This work overturns the longstanding paradigm that ITGB2 is restricted to leukocytes by discovering a tumor cell-intrinsic ITGB2:ICAM-1:Wnt protumorigenic axis as a bona fide cancer therapeutic target in melanoma."

A serum-free, fully humanized co-culture system utilizing human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) was developed to differentiate CB-CD34+ cells towards B and NK cell lineages. Differentiation dynamics were monitored via flow cytometry, with immunophenotypic analysis tracking progression from progenitors to mature cells. The system generated CD19+ IgM+ immature B cells and CD56+ CD16+ NK cells, recapitulating fetal stages of human lymphopoiesis. Serum-free media conditions ensured reproducibility and high overall yield of CD19+ B (35 +/- 5.32%) and CD56+ NK (28.46 +/- 7.01%) cell progenitors. Flow cytometry identified distinct population peaks, confirming temporal control over differentiation. This clinically relevant platform addresses the limitations of traditional models by providing a more physiologically accurate human microenvironment. The serum-free system supports applications in disease modeling, genotoxic compound screening, and mutational studies of hematopoiesis. By enabling scalable production of B and NK cells it aims to accelerate translational research for immunodeficiencies, cancer immunotherapy, and hematopoietic disorders."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma demonstrates limited responsiveness to PD-1 blockade, largely due to its immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). The specific mechanisms by which cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) contribute to immunosuppression in osteosarcoma are not fully understood. METHODS: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on osteosarcoma tissues from patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 therapy to investigate the tumor microenvironment. Cellular composition, gene expression programs, and signaling pathways were analyzed. Functional assays, pull-down and PLA-flow binding validation, and in vivo mouse models were used to dissect the mechanisms by which CAF-derived factors influence CD8(+) T cell function and contribute to immunotherapy response. RESULTS: We identified a subpopulation of CD36(+) CAFs, characterized by adaptive uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL) and activation of the PPARG-FABP4 axis. This metabolic program promoted ANGPTL4 secretion, which bound integrin on CD8(+) T cells and activated the JAK2-STAT3 pathway, leading to T cell exhaustion and impaired effector function. In vivo, administration of VitE effectively scavenged OxLDL, reprogrammed the TME, enhanced CD8(+) T cell infiltration, and synergized with PD-1 blockade to improve tumor control. CONCLUSIONS: CD36(+) CAFs drive immunosuppressive metabolic reprogramming via the OxLDL-PPARG-ANGPTL4 axis, promoting CD8(+) T cell exhaustion and resistance to immunotherapy in osteosarcoma. Targeting this pathway with VitE alleviated CAF-mediated immune suppression and enhanced PD-1 blockade responses in preclinical models, providing a rationale for metabolism-based combinatorial strategies in osteosarcoma."

Considering the importance of the health system in CC prevention and control, this article examines the role of the health system as a whole in the CC screening in Peru, a dimension that previous studies have not comprehensively covered. To this end, this article utilizes the WHO's building blocks framework as an analytical tool to examine the performance of the health system when providing services to prevent, detect, and treat CC. METHODS: The research took place in the region of Madre de Dios, located southeast of the Peruvian Amazon. Madre de Dios reports the second-highest CC mortality rate in the country, and a lack of oncologic treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, pediatrics, and surgical) and palliative care units. This qualitative study is grounded in in-depth interviews with key informants in Lima and Madre de Dios, as well as an analysis of report records provided by health authorities in Madre de Dios and Lima. The interviews were conducted between November 2022 and August 2023. They are policy experts with experience in designing national-level health policies, as well as health officials in Madre de Dios. Additionally, they have conducted interviews with representatives of civil society organisations in Madre de Dios. Additionally, we analyzed the anonymized records of Pap smear results collected in Madre de Dios for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. RESULTS: Governance is crucial for organizing CC activities. Vertical national programs and policies are failing to accommodate local solutions and lack sensitivity to the unique characteristics of different contexts. CC policies in Peru are ambitious, and their implementation is challenged in Madre de Dios by the lack of trained human resources at the primary healthcare and hospital level, lack of laboratories, lack of financial resources for patient referrals, poor information system that do not allow patient follow-up, and lack of resources and political will to guarantee equipment maintenance. The analysis also highlights the significant shortcomings of organizing health system indicators around services provided, thereby ignoring indicators that assess the impact of health interventions on population health. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis demonstrated the utility of the WHO health system building blocks framework in analyzing the shortcomings of public policies aimed at preventing, detecting, and treating CC. It also provides a comprehensive view of the critical features of the health system that must be considered when designing and implementing interventions to address health conditions, such as CC."

    "abstract": "The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC) remains limited, highlighting an urgent need for predictive biomarkers. Through multi-omics analysis, we identified two novel MSS CRC subtypes, termed DUB-H and DUB-L. The DUB-L subtype exhibited an inflamed tumor immune microenvironment, a superior response to immune therapy, and better recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to DUB-H. The classifier gene USP7 was selected as a gene of interest due to its specific expression profile, which is highly expressed in MSS CRC but not in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors, and strongly correlated with suppressed immune infiltration. Large-scale clinical analyses confirmed associations between high USP7 expression, microsatellite stability, specific consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), and unfavorable prognosis. Single-cell analysis and multiplex immunofluorescence validated an immune-desert phenotype in USP7-high MSS tumors. Mechanistically, USP7 knockdown in MSS CRC cells enhances the secretion of T-cell-recruiting chemokines (CXCL9/10/11), promoting CD8(+) T cell recruitment and cytotoxicity in vitro. In vivo experiments demonstrated that USP7 blockade enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment in MSS CRC models by remodeling the tumor immune microenvironment, increasing infiltration and function of CD8(+) T and NK cells. Consistently, low USP7 expression is associated with a better response to anti-PD-1 therapy. Overall, we propose a novel DUB-based classification system for MSS CRC and demonstrate that targeting USP7 may overcome immunotherapy resistance by converting immunologically \"cold\" tumors into \"hot\" ones."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The risk of thyroid cancer (TC) has been steadily increasing globally, prompting interest in identifying modifiable risk factors. Coffee, rich in bioactive compounds with potential metabolic effects, may influence TC risk, yet the relationship remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to systematically review and conduct a meta-analysis of observational studies to assess the association between coffee consumption and the risk of TC. METHODS: Comprehensive searches were conducted in major databases through September 2025 to identify appropriate studies. Following the study selection process, relevant data were extracted. Pooled hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models to account for heterogeneity. RESULTS: This meta-analysis of 10 observational (cohort and case-control) studies found no statistically significant association between coffee consumption and TC risk across both study designs. The pooled analysis of four cohort studies (6 effect sizes) yielded a pooled HR of 0.94 (95% CI: [0.74, 1.20], p = 0.645; I(2) = 31%), indicating no meaningful risk reduction. The pooled analysis of six case-control studies (8 effect sizes) showed a non-significant trend toward a protective effect, with a pooled OR of 0.78 (95% CI: [0.59, 1.03], p = 0.091; I(2) = 12%), indicating low heterogeneity across the designs. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the findings suggest that coffee consumption is not significantly associated with an increased risk of TC. Case-control studies indicate a possible protective trend that warrants further investigation, and the low heterogeneity supports the consistency of these results. Nonetheless, additional large-scale prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and clarify the underlying biological mechanisms. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.

    "abstract": "Extrachromosomal circular DNA (ecDNA) has emerged as a critical determinant of poor clinical outcomes and immune escape in tumors, but the high cost and technical complexity of current detecting techniques limit its broader investigation in cancer immunotherapy. Leveraging the combined machine learning algorithms including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, RandomForest (RF) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), we developed a 12-gene transcriptomic score (EC_score) to predict the existence of ecDNA through RNA-seq. EC_score demonstrated reliable predictive performance in two independent cohorts (AUC > 0.70), validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in both cell lines and clinical samples. Next, we found that EC_score emerged as an independent adverse prognostic factor across multiple immunotherapy cohorts. Notably, high EC_score correlated with cell cycle activation and immunosuppression, characterized by reduced lymphocytes infiltration and upregulated immunosuppressive markers, including MHC molecules, co-inhibitory immune checkpoints and TGF-beta signals. In general, we established and validated a 12-gene signature (EC_score) derived from RNA-seq, offering a novel computational tool for predicting the presence of extrachromosomal circular DNA and stratifying cancer immunotherapy response."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Persons living with HIV (PLWH) have a higher risk of persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and anal cancer. We evaluated knowledge and awareness of HPV infection and risk factors for anal cancer among PLWH in Puerto Rico (PR). METHODS: Data from a cross-sectional study (2020-2021) were analyzed (n = 212). Inclusion criteria included PLWH, aged >/= 26 years, and living in PR. Telephone interviews collected information on sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics. Two 13-item scales were used to assess knowledge of HPV and anal cancer risk factors; adequate knowledge for both scales were defined as scoring > 70%. Logistic regression models using generalized linear models were used to determine the association between (1) HPV infection awareness, (2) HPV infection knowledge, and (3) anal cancer risk factors knowledge. RESULTS: The median age was 54 years (IQR: 46,58), 67.5% were male, 71.7% reported having an income <$20,000, and 54.2% had an education level of more than high school. HPV awareness was high (82.1%), but only 40.2% and 3.8% had adequate knowledge of HPV and anal cancer risk factors, respectively. In adjusted logistic regression models, men who have sex with men (OR: 1.26, 95%CI: 1.07-1.47) and women (OR: 1.35, 95%CI: 1.15-1.59) aged >/= 50 years had higher odds of HPV awareness than heterosexual men in that age group. Moreover, those with history of anal Pap test aged < 50 years had more HPV awareness (OR 1.34, 95%CI: 1.08-1.66) than their counterparts. Adequate HPV knowledge was higher among participants with an education level of more than high-school (OR:1.28, 95%CI: 1.10-1.50) and with a history of HPV diagnosis (OR:1.33, 95%CI: 1.08-1.65) than their counterparts. In addition, people with good/very good/excellent health perception had higher odds of HPV knowledge (OR:1.23, 95%CI: 1.03-1.47) than those who reported poor/regular health perception. For anal cancer risk factors, those living with HIV for >/= 15 years had increased odds of having adequate knowledge (OR:1.07, 95%CI: 1.02-1.14) than their counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high awareness of HPV, limited knowledge about HPV and anal cancer risk factors was observed among PLWH. Results from our study highlight the need for educational efforts within this population as an anal cancer prevention strategy."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As a vital endocrine organ, the pancreas exhibits differences in anatomical structure and microenvironment between its head and tail. However, whether there is heterogeneity in miRNA expression within the islet cells of these two regions and what biological significance this heterogeneity may entail remain unclear. METHODS: This study utilized high-throughput sequencing to analyze the miRNA expression profiles in the islet cells from the pancreatic head and tail in rats. The TargetScan and miRDB databases were used to predict target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs). The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases were utilized to analyze the target genes. The key miRNA was verified by qRT-PCR. RESULT: A total of 445 miRNAs were detected in the islet cells of the pancreatic head and tail, among which 69 showed significant differences (|log2 fold change|>0.585 and P<0.05). Compared with the pancreatic tail, 28 miRNAs were upregulated and 41 miRNAs were downregulated in the pancreatic head. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these target genes were significantly enriched in functions such as negative regulation of cellular process, anatomical structure development, intracellular organelle, pancreatic cancer, insulin resistance, MAPK signaling, Wnt signaling, and Hippo signaling. In addition, KEGG analysis of target genes showed that miR-124-3p was in several pathways, such as the insulin signaling pathway, endocrine resistance, small cell lung cancer, and other pathways in cancer. qRT-PCR results showed that miR-124-3p was significantly upregulated in the pancreatic head. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide novel insights into the heterogeneity of miRNA expression in the pancreas and the molecular mechanisms underlying pancreatic cancer, offering potential targets for future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer continues to be a major cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the United States. Despite declining mortality rates in recent decades, variations across race, region, urban-rural status, and age remain insufficiently characterized. Therefore, updated evidence is essential to inform effective prevention and control strategies. METHODS: Prostate cancer deaths (ICD-10 code C61) among the U.S. men aged >/= 45 years from 1999 to 2023 were analyzed using the CDC WONDER database. Age-adjusted mortality rate (AAMR) was calculated per 100,000 population and standardized to the 2000 U.S. standard population. Temporal trends were examined using joinpoint regression to estimate annual percent change (APC) and average APC. Subgroup analyses were conducted by region, race, urban-rural status, and age, with additional assessments at the state level. RESULTS: Over the 25-year study period, 749,932 prostate cancer-related deaths were reported. Mortality initially declined but began to rise after 2013, reaching a peak of 33,860 deaths in 2023, reflecting a 'decline followed by rebound' pattern. Importantly, the increase in absolute deaths primarily reflects the effects of population aging. The AAMR decreased significantly overall (AAPC, -2.20%; P < .05), although the pace of decline slowed after 2013. This is likely influenced by changes in Prostate-Specific Antigen screening practices. Regionally, the South consistently exhibited the highest mortality, while the Northeast achieved the largest reduction and the West the smallest decline. By race, non-Hispanic (NH) Black men experienced the sharpest decrease yet continued to face the highest mortality, nearly twice that of NH White men. Mortality remained elevated in nonmetropolitan compared with metropolitan areas, and men aged 75 years and older continued to face the greatest risk. CONCLUSIONS: From 1999 to 2023, prostate cancer mortality among U.S. men aged 45 years and older showed a consistent decline. While the AAMR continued to decrease, the rate of decline slowed after 2013, likely due to changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening practices. In contrast, the observed rise in the absolute number of deaths mainly reflects demographic effects associated with population aging. The greatest burdens were observed among residents of the South, NH Black men, older adults, and rural populations. State-level AAMRs revealed a clear geographic gradient, with consistently higher rates in the South and lower rates in the Northeast. These findings highlight the need for future prevention and control strategies to prioritize high-risk groups through targeted interventions that promote health equity."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite advancements in multimodal therapy, glioma remains a lethal brain tumor with limited prognostic biomarkers. Programmed cell death (PCD) pathways and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as therapeutic targets, but their combined prognostic potential in glioma remains underexplored. METHODS: RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) cohorts were analyzed to identify PCD-related lncRNAs. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) Cox regression and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were applied to construct a prognostic signature, with external validation performed in an independent cohort. Tumor immune microenvironment characterization was subsequently conducted through the Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource (TIMER) database using the inverse fold product algorithm, which quantified six tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIIC) subtypes across 10,897 pan-cancer samples. Immune checkpoint differential expression between risk strata was assessed via single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Drug sensitivity prediction was performed using the Cancer Genome Project (GCP) databases. RESULTS: A 4-lncRNA signature effectively stratified patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. The prognosis of the high-risk group is worse. In multivariate analysis, a risk score can independently predict the prognosis and has a robust prediction efficiency in the CGGA external verification set. The infiltration of immunosuppressive cells, such as M2 macrophages, increased the expression of immune checkpoints, such as PD-L1, increased, and the infiltration of CD8 + T cells decreased in high-risk patients. Computational screening identified elesclomol as a potential therapeutic agent showing subtype-specific efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the prognostic significance of lncRNAs associated with PCD in glioma and provides computational evidence for their potential as therapeutic targets. While the results suggest novel avenues for treatment development, they must be interpreted cautiously due to the lack of experimental validation. Future studies should aim to validate these results through controlled clinical trials and explore underlying molecular mechanisms."

    "abstract": "CONTEXT: Aging individuals are more likely to experience multiple health issues, resulting in increased and complex healthcare needs, particularly at the end-of-life (EoL). While several studies have shown that healthcare costs rose substantially during the final year and months of life, there is limited research on the EoL utilization and cost in Quebec, specifically using population-based data that span multiple healthcare settings and different causes of death. OBJECTIVE: To examine healthcare and social care utilization and cost during the last year of life of people who died in Quebec at the age of 66 and over, according to their cause of death. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective quantitative longitudinal study to analyze individuals' healthcare utilization and cost during their last year of life between 2014 and 2018. Individuals were retrieved from the death registry and classified according to their cause of death as: cancer, organ failure, frailty (physical or cognitive) and other or unknown. Healthcare and social care utilization included: medical visits, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, homecare and long-term care (LTC). Costs were attributed to services either directly from administrative databases or estimated from public financial reports. We used generalized linear models (GLMs) to assess variations in service utilization and costs: Poisson or negative binomial models were employed for count outcomes based on data dispersion, and Gamma log link for costs. RESULTS: The cohort included 21,255 individuals (52.6% women) with ~ 40% of deaths occurring among individuals aged 80-89 years. Nearly 50% of the cohort died from an organ failure, 30% of cancer and 15% of frailty. Cancer and organ failure were associated with high acute care use and costs, while frailty led to greater use of LTC and social care. Overall, the EoL the individual average cost was 34,467$ ($25,000-$53,000), depending on cause of death and type of services used. Notably, social services cost exceeds healthcare cost, especially for people who died from frailty, highlighting the financial burden of LTC accommodation. CONCLUSION: This study highlights distinct EoL healthcare and social services utilization and related costs among older adults, depending on the cause of death, age, and sex. These findings underscore the need for tailored care strategies that reflect different EoL trajectories."

We evaluated the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a recombinant bivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine composed of L1 virus-like particles (VLPs) for HPV 16 and HPV18 (HPV-2), produced in Pichia pastoris, in healthy Chinese women aged 18-30 years. METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 10 centres in China (Nov 2014-Jan 2020), participants were assigned 1:1 to receive three doses of HPV-2 or placebo at months 0, 2, and 6. The primary endpoint was efficacy against histopathology-confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher (CIN2+) associated with HPV16/18 through 48 months. Secondary endpoints were safety (adverse events [AEs] within 1 month of any dose; serious AEs throughout follow-up) and immunogenicity (neutralising antibody titres and seroconversion at Month 7 in a predefined subset). RESULTS: Of 12,000 women enrolled, 11,999 received the first dose and 11,281 completed all three doses. Over 48 months, 17 CIN2 + cases occurred: 3 among vaccine recipients (n = 5190) versus 14 among placebo recipients (n = 5167), corresponding to vaccine efficacy of 78.6% (95% CI 23.3-96.1; p = 0.012). No vaccine-related serious AEs occurred. Solicited local AEs were mainly mild pain, reported by 25.9% of vaccinees and 7.9% of placebo recipients. Fever was the most common systemic AE (27.4% vs. 26.4%). In the immunogenicity subset, 99.7% (349/350) and 99.4% (348/350) of vaccinees were seropositive for HPV16 and HPV18 neutralising antibodies, respectively, at Month 7. CONCLUSIONS: Three doses of HPV-2 were well tolerated, highly immunogenic, and efficacious against CIN2 + up to 4 years post-vaccination, supporting further evaluation in the adolescent target population for HPV vaccination campaigns.

    "abstract": "High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is a highly fatal disease with frequent recurrence and high mortality rates, despite ongoing treatment advancements. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an experimental technique used to obtain extensive genetic information, making it a key component of precision medicine. We conducted a study based on a sample of 108 patients with HGSOC retrospectively selected from Severance Hospital and Gangnam Severance Hospital. We aimed to identify the genetic alterations associated with HGSOC recurrence and survival using deep targeted sequencing. Somatic mutations in NF1, FAT1, ROS1, NOTCH3, and BLM are more common in recurrent ovarian cancer. Differences in copy number variations (CNVs) and gene fusion events were also observed. Using multivariable stepwise logistic regression, we found that the presence of exonic mutations in the NF1 and ROS1 genes and a tumor mutational burden (TMB) value >/= 10 were significantly associated with recurrence in HGSOC patients. High TMB (TMB >/= 10), Del 13q14.3 mutation, and exonic mutations in NOTCH3, NF1, ROS1, ATM, FAT1, and SLX4 genes were associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS), while the ARID1A gene was observed to be associated with overall survival. This study identified key genetic alterations associated with recurrence and survival in HGSOC and confirmed that specific genetic mutations were linked to disease prognosis. We expect that these findings will contribute to more precise prognosis prediction and the development of personalized therapeutic strategies for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Despite strong evidence supporting universal psychosocial risk screening in pediatric cancer implementation remains inconsistent. Factors at organizational, provider, and patient/family levels impact implementation. Potential differing perspectives regarding risk screening among multidisciplinary providers may influence uptake. This study describes perceived barriers and facilitators in implementing the Psychosocial Assessment Tool (PAT), a psychosocial risk screener and examines differences by discipline. METHODS: One hundred seventeen healthcare providers (HCPs) representing medical, social work, and psychology from 18 pediatric cancer programs completed two scales from PAT Implementation Questionnaire (PIQ). Item scores (1-4 scale) were ranked and differences tested by discipline. RESULTS: Barriers were perceived as \"minor\" and facilitators as \"significant\" and overall PIQ scale scores did not differ by discipline. PIQ-B had a significantly lower mean score (M = 2.03) than PIQ-F (M = 3.08), p < 0.001). Barriers and facilitators rated most impactful (highest mean scores) were: Barriers: \"Language barriers/cultural considerations\" (M = 2.37) and \"Integrating results in EHR\" (M = 2.26); and Facilitators: \"Promotes psychosocial care for all families\" (M = 3.31) and \"Promotes positive psychosocial outcomes\" (M = 3.25). Significant differences were found in the rank ordering of barriers and facilitators by discipline, between social workers and psychologists, with the former noting time constraints associated with screening. CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary HCPs generally agree on the benefits and challenges in implementation of screening with the PAT. Subtle variations in perceived impact of barriers and facilitators between social workers and psychologists highlight the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and communication to facilitate implementation."

    "abstract": "Metastatic cancer cells, originating from cancer stem cells with metastatic capacity, utilize nutrient flexibility to navigate the challenges of the metastatic cascade. However, the nutrient required to maintain the stemness potentials of metastatic cancer cells remains unclear. Here, we reveal that metastatic breast cancer cells sustain stemness and initiate metastasis upon detachment by taking up and oxidizing lactate. In detached metastasizing breast cancer cells, lactate is incorporated into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, boosting oxidative phosphorylation, and promoting the stemness potentials via alpha-KG-DNMT3B-mediated SOX2 hypomethylation. Moreover, lactate is taken up and oxidized in mitochondria by the CD147/MCT1/LDHB complex, which correlates with stemness potentials and tumor metastasis in patients with breast cancer. An intracellularly expressed single-chain variable fragment targeting mitochondrial CD147 (mito-CD147 scFv) effectively disrupts the mitochondrial CD147/MCT1/LDHB complex, inhibits lactate-induced stemness potential, depletes circulating breast cancer cells, and reduces metastatic burden, suggesting promising clinical applications in reducing lactate-fueled metastasis."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with intermediate risk thyroid cancer face the decision of whether or not to undergo radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment after total thyroidectomy. This process is challenging due to the unclear risks and benefits of RAI treatment for intermediate risk disease. The study identified the decisional needs of patients offered RAI treatment for thyroid cancer to inform the development of a web-based patient decision aid (PtDA). METHOD: We used purposive sampling to recruit 23 adult patients with thyroid cancer (M(age) = 39.1; 83% female) from three metropolitan hospitals who were offered RAI treatment. Participants completed an online survey before taking part in one of four 2-h focus groups moderated by a clinical psychologist. Semi-structured interviews explored patients' experiences, decisional needs, and recommended elements for a PtDA. Two raters independently coded transcripts and used content analysis to analyze qualitative data.  RESULTS: Content analysis revealed three broad domains: (1) the range of patient involvement in the RAI treatment decision-making process, (2) personal values-based decisional outcomes, and (3) decision aid content recommendations on the basis of patients' knowledge gaps about RAI treatment. Patients' recommendations included the need for information on the RAI dose and common side effects, risk stratification, safety precautions for radioactivity, low-iodine diet guidance, and financial costs. CONCLUSION: The study provides patient insights for a targeted web-based PtDA that integrates personal values, risk information, and logistical considerations to support informed decision-making about RAI treatment. Future research to examine the benefits of PtDAs for treatment of intermediate-risk thyroid cancer is needed."

    "abstract": "Radioligand-antibody conjugates (RadioBodies), also known as radiolabeled antibodies, represent an emerging class that enables targeted delivery of radionuclides to tumor cells using antibodies. Conventional antibodies (full-length antibodies) and nonconventional antibodies (antibody fragments) are ideal agents for targeted delivery of radionuclides to tumor sites, owing to their high affinity and specificity. Antibody guides the radionuclide to a precise target, where it participates in killing of cancer cells (therapy) or helps with imaging (diagnosis). RadioBodies are yet to be effectively employed in cancer theranostics but have the potential for the same. Conventional antibodies have long circulatory half-lives, a feature that limits their application in diagnosis but is desirable for therapy. Using nonconventional antibodies (antibody fragments) offers the advantages of small size and removal of the Fc function, which reduces the serum half-life. In recent years, advances in antibody engineering, chelator chemistry and radionuclide technology have greatly facilitated the development of RadioBodies for desired applications. In this review, we discuss the roles of antibodies, chelators, and radionuclides in the clinical development of RadioBodies for cancer theranostics."

Traditional diagnostic techniques often lack objectivity, are prone to operator bias, and show limited reproducibility. There is a need for diagnostic methods that are reliable, noninvasive, and suitable for monitoring disease progression. This study (German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS-ID: DRKS00027366) aimed to evaluate hyperspectral imaging as a tool for detecting and classifying secondary lymphedema. METHODS: We conducted a prospective multicenter study including 58 women with unilateral secondary lymphedema. Lymphedema severity was categorized according to the International Society of Lymphology. Each participant underwent conventional assessments, including limb circumference measurements, two-point discrimination tests, joint mobility evaluation, and ultrasound imaging of skin and subcutaneous tissue, plus gave patient-reported outcomes. Hyperspectral images were collected using the TIVITA Tissue system, which captures light reflectance from 500 to 1000 nanometers. From these data, the lipid-to-water ratio and the TIVITA tissue water index were calculated to evaluate tissue changes related to lymphedema. RESULTS: Here, we show that conventional methods correlate moderately with lymphedema stage, with ultrasound measurements of skin and subcutaneous thickness showing the strongest associations. Hyperspectral imaging shows strong correlations, with interlimb differences in lipid-to-water ratio and tissue water index outperforming conventional methods. These measurements highlight clear fluid accumulation in the affected limbs. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperspectral imaging provides reproducible, objective, and noninvasive assessment of secondary lymphedema. These findings support its potential as a diagnostic and monitoring tool to improve staging and treatment evaluation."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The role of exercise in modulating the immune system and cytokines has garnered increasing attention, particularly in the context of breast cancer survivorship. Breast cancer and its treatments often lead to immunosuppression, which can heighten the risk of infections and recurrence. Emerging evidence suggests that various forms of exercise, including aerobic and resistance exercise, can positively influence cytokine profiles in breast cancer patients. However, the specific effects and underlying mechanisms remain underexplored. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to conduct a systematic review of the studies focused on the effects of exercise on cytokine profiles of breast cancer survivors. METHODS: The databases of Cochrane Library, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science were searched until 31 December 2024, following PRISMA guidelines. Randomized controlled trials were included if they compared breast cancer survivors participating in a structured exercise program with a non-exercise control group and measured cytokine variables both before and after the intervention. The quality of the included studies was rated with the PEDro scale. RESULTS: Eleven studies with 481 individuals undergoing exercise interventions were included in the analysis and compared to 240 individuals as controls. Participants in these studies ranged in age from early 40s to late 50s. These studies examined the effects of various exercise interventions, including resistance exercise (n = 2), aerobic exercise (n = 2), concurrent aerobic + resistance exercise (n = 5), tai chi (n = 1), and yoga (n = 1). The training period ranged from 8 to 52 weeks, with most studies lasting 12-15 weeks. The average frequency of training was three sessions per week with a mean session duration of 55 min. The quality of the studies showed a mean PEDro score of 6.5 +/- 0.9 points (range 5-8 points). Both aerobic and resistance training alone or in combination impacted several immune indices, including decreases in serum concentrations of interleukin-15 (IL-15), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), TNF-alpha expression in NK and NKT cells (NKTNF-alpha, and NKTTNF-alpha), and lower IL-10/TNF-alpha ratio. Other less habitual exercise interventions such as tai chi and yoga also induced positive effects on immune indices. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer survivors enrolled in several forms of exercise training showed improved cytokine parameters compared with counterparts who did not perform exercise. The benefits of exercise training on cytokine profiles of breast cancer survivors were evident with both aerobic and resistance training, whether performed separately or in combination, and with other training regimens such as tai chi and yoga."

    "abstract": "PARG plays an important role in cancer progression and immunoresponse, but its role in breast cancer is not yet fully elucidated. The advanced breast cancer is still a persistent challenge in clinical oncology. Despite the encouraging progress made in cancer immunotherapy, its efficacy is still limited by tumor malignancy and the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Through comprehensive proteomic analysis employing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we identified ITCH-a HECT-family E3 ubiquitin ligase-as a novel interaction partner of PARG. Co-immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays revealed that the PARG inhibition markedly enhances the PARylation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH. This triggers its autoubiquitination-dependent activation, after which activated ITCH catalyzes the ubiquitination of the oncoprotein metadherin (MTDH). This ultimately leads to MTDH's proteasomal degradation and the consequent suppression of tumor growth. Importantly, RNA immunoprecipitation analysis further demonstrated that PARGi-induced ITCH/MTDH potentiates the MHC-I antigen presentation machinery in tumor cells, which correlates with increased infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes within the tumor microenvironment. In invivo validation, combinatorial therapy using the selective PARG inhibitor COH34 with anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade demonstrated synergistic therapeutic efficacy in a murine breast cancer model. To the best of our knowledge, PARG inhibition plays an important role in limiting cancer progression and potentiating immune response, depending on its regulatory function in PARylation and ubiquitination in breast cancer."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Mandibular fractures (MF) are among the most common facial injuries, with significant implications for patient function and quality of life. There is a lack of comprehensive, multi-institutional studies examining short term outcomes and predictors of early complications after treatment of mandibular fractures. METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (ACS-NSQIP) was queried for the time period 2008 through 2021 to identify patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of MF. We extracted data on comorbidities, preoperative blood values, and 30-day postoperative outcomes regarding the occurrence of complications. RESULTS: A total of n = 2,705 patients (443 females; 2,262 males) with an average age of 35 years and a mean BMI of 25.4 kg/m(2) were analyzed. The most common fracture locations were the mandibular body (42%), angle (22%), and symphysis (16%). Complications occurred in 9.4% of cases, with reoperations and readmissions being the most common general complications. Multivariate analysis revealed site-specific risk profiles: condylar and symphyseal fractures showed higher complication rates, while subcondylar fractures had lower rates. Patients undergoing ORIF without placement in mandibulomaxillary fixation (MMF) had a higher rate of surgical complications. Smoking, weight loss, disseminated cancer history, and higher wound class were independently associated with increased risk of complications. CONCLUSION: A 30-day postoperative complication rate of nearly 10% emphasizes the need for robust risk stratification and targeted strategies to further improve surgical safety in this challenging patient population. Site-specific risk variations, particularly for symphyseal and condylar fractures, and the higher rate of complication in patients without MMF, underscore the importance of tailored procedural planning. Moreover, identifying smoking and inpatient care as independent risk factors underscores the value of addressing modifiable risks and optimizing care for high-risk patients to improve surgical outcomes."

    "abstract": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a key biomarker associated with breast cancer, and its reliable detection using effective diagnostic tools is clinically significant. Here, we developed an electrochemical aptasensor based on an electroactive labeling strategy for the detection of HER2 using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). A nickel nanofoam/gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)/silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) nanocomposite was employed as a novel electrode modifier synthesized via a simple, low-cost, and reproducible method. In this design, AuNPs enabled stable aptamer immobilization, while AgNPs acted as electroactive labels, enhancing the current response through a synergistic effect that could not be achieved with either nanoparticle alone. The newly developed aptasensor demonstrated high sensitivity and good reproducibility for HER2 detection. The aptasensor showed a wide linear range of 0.001-100 ng mL(-1), a very low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.30 pg mL(-1), and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1.0 pg mL(-1), indicating its significant potential for clinical diagnostic applications."

    "abstract": "Two key challenges in translating messenger RNA-based lipid nanoparticle (mRNA-LNP) cancer vaccines to clinical use are limited mRNA expression and unavoidable inflammatory responses. Here we develop a membrane-destabilizing zwitterionic ionizable lipid that enhances mRNA expression by promoting endosomal escape while reducing inflammatory reactogenicity. This lipid features a pyridine-based carboxybetaine (PyCB) zwitterionic headgroup, biodegradable multitailed alkyl chains and a tertiary amine linker. The PyCB headgroup forms a zwitterionic PyCB-water complex that protonates to a positively charged state below pH 6.8. This allows for good biocompatibility at physiological pH and strong protonation in endosomes, enabling earlier and more efficient mRNA release when synergistic with the tertiary amine and the tail moiety. Incorporating membrane-destabilizing zwitterionic lipids into the LNP formulation used in a commercially available mRNA vaccine significantly boosts mRNA expression in antigen-presenting cells within lymph nodes, enhancing cytotoxic T cell activation. In addition, these membrane-destabilizing zwitterionic lipid-containing nanoparticles show reduced inflammation and neutrophil infiltration at the injection site due to their zwitterionic property. These lipids are also compatible with existing targeted nanoparticle formulations, further improving mRNA delivery."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study evaluated the safety and preliminary efficacy of zolbetuximab plus chemotherapy in patients with claudin 18 isoform 2 (CLDN18.2)-positive advanced gastric cancer (AGC). METHODS: This single-institutional retrospective study enrolled patients with HER2-negative CLDN18.2-positive AGC who were treated with zolbetuximab plus chemotherapy between July 2024 and August 2025. RESULTS: The cohort included 50 patients with a median age of 63 years (range 30-83; 44% male). The primary tumor location was the stomach in 86% of the patients. Meanwhile, 26% of the patients underwent prior gastrectomy. The PD-L1 combined positive score was < 5 in 87% of patients. Among 24 patients with measurable lesions at baseline, the objective response and disease control rates were 66.7% and 87.5%, respectively. After median follow-up of 7.3 months, median progression-free survival and the duration of response were 6.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.3-10.7] and 6.7 months (95% CI 4.7-10.2), respectively. Grade >/= 3 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 62% of the patients, most commonly hypoalbuminemia (22%), neutrophil count decreased (22%) and anorexia (12%). Subsequent treatment was received by 83% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Zolbetuximab plus chemotherapy was administered to real-world patients with CLDN18.2-positive AGC with acceptable safety profiles and showed preliminary antitumor efficacy. Nevertheless, some adverse events warrant careful monitoring."

    "abstract": "Pancreatic and Esophageal cancers are highly aggressive with high mortality and limited treatment, causing over 466,000 and 544,100 deaths worldwide in 2020 respectively. This highlights the urgent need for safer,and effective anticancer agents. Catalpol, a natural iridoid glycoside, shows anticancer potential, but due to its poor drug-like properties it requires structural modification. This study investigates pyrazole-modified catalpol derivatives as dual inhibitors for these cancers using Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) modelling, molecular docking, and pharmacokinetic studies. We analyzed fourteen pyrazole-modified catalpol derivatives with reported IC50values against four cancer cell lines(BxPC-3, PANC-1, Eca109, and EC9706). The molecules were optimized using DensityFunctional Theory (DFT), and 2D molecular descriptors were calculated using PaDEL. QSAR models were developed by utilizing a Genetic Function Algorithm (GFA) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and validated using statistical metrics such as R(2), Q(2), R(2)adj, and R(2)pred. Docking studies targeted VEGFR-2 and BRAF V600E kinases using AutoDockVina, while ADMET and drug-likeness properties were predicted using SwissADME and pkCSM tools. The external validation R(2)pred values for BxPC-3, PANC-1, Eca109, and EC9706 cell lines were 0.9412, 0.9535, 0.9981, and 0.9935, respectively. Among the derivatives, compound 3k showed the highest binding affinity for VEGFR-2 (- 8.18 kcal/mol) and BRAF (- 8.64 kcal/mol), surpassing the control drugs etoposide (- 8.00 kcal/mol) and dabrafenib (- 8.15 kcal/mol) respectively. ADMET analysis confirmed good intestinal absorption, limited blood-brain barrier penetration, non-toxicity, acceptable total clearance, and compliance with Lipinski's rule. Overall, the study suggests that pyrazole-modified catalpol derivatives, especially compound 3k, are promising multi-target inhibitors for pancreatic and esophageal cancers, justify further in-vitro and in-vivo studies."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is projected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2040, with the highest disease burden expected amongst Non-Hispanic Black patients. One of the most significant predictors of poor outcomes is the presence of cancer-associated cachexia (CCa). Yet, race- and ethnicity-specific biomarkers for early CCa diagnosis are lacking. METHODS: We evaluated a panel of candidate biomarkers of CCa in a diverse cohort of patients with pre-treatment serum using multiplex ELISA-based methods. RESULTS: We find that growth/differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is associated with cachexia severity, is superior to standard biomarkers at classifying cachexia, and differentiates between non-cachexia and pre-cachexia status, but only among Hispanic/Latinx and non-Hispanic White participants. Furthermore, high GDF-15 levels at diagnosis are associated with a greater weight loss from 3.3% (95%CI = -0.14-6.7) to 8.0% (CI = 5.9-10.1) over the 6 months post-diagnosis. Finally, both ENA-78/CXCL5 and GRO-alpha/CXCL1 are elevated in non-Hispanic Black individuals in a disease-independent manner (P < 0.001 for both analytes). CONCLUSIONS: GDF-15 may be a potential biomarker for \"pre-cachexia\" in the non-Hispanic White and the Hispanic population, but not non-Hispanic Black individuals. These findings underscore the unmet need to enroll non-Hispanic Black participants in clinical trials for CCa."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The EAES released guidelines on the role of taTME in the management of rectal cancer in 2022. OBJECTIVE: To develop updated, evidence-informed recommendations to support clinicians involved in the management of taTME; to provide guidance for hospital managers, policymakers, and patients with low- and mid-rectal cancers. METHODS: We performed a systematic review to identify randomized trials and matched nonrandomized studies comparing transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) to laparoscopic TME (laTME) or robotic TME (roTME) in patients with low- and mid-rectal cancer. A panel of general and colorectal surgeons, a radiologist, a pathologist, and patient partners appraised the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. The panel developed recommendations using an evidence-to-decision framework during an in-person consensus meeting. We applied a Delphi survey to establish consensus. RESULTS: The panel recommends taTME over laTME in patients with low- and selected mid-rectal cancers when access to surgeons with expertise in performing taTME in high-volume rectal cancer centers is available (strong recommendation). This recommendation applies to patients eligible for sphincter preservation who are at high risk for conversion to abdominoperineal resection, including male gender with BMI > 30 kg/m(2). The recommendation is supported by a reduction in 30-day major complications and disease recurrence at 2 years with taTME compared to laTME. When access to a surgeon with expertise in performing taTME is not available, the panel recommends against taTME over laTME (strong recommendation). Further, the panel suggests roTME as an alternative to taTME in patients with low- and selected mid-rectal cancers when access to surgeons with expertise in performing taTME is not available (conditional recommendation). CONCLUSION: We provide evidence-informed guidance on the role of taTME in the surgical management of patients with low- and mid-rectal cancers. Patients and surgeons should exercise shared-decision making to apply patient-tailored decisions when considering treatment options."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Lung cancer screening has historically been associated with false-positive results that can lead to complications and increased costs. LungFlag is a machine-learning risk prediction model using individual-level data to identify people at high risk of developing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), prompting healthcare professionals to consider appropriate actions such as recommended screening with low-dose computed tomography. This study evaluated the budget impact of using the LungFlag risk prediction model to identify candidates for lung cancer screening from a US payer perspective. METHODS: This budget impact model estimated total annual costs with or without LungFlag for a hypothetical 1 million-member US commercial health plan. Incremental costs were evaluated over a 5-year period with a cycle length of 1 year; no discounting was applied. All costs were adjusted to 2021 US dollars. The population included screening-naive individuals aged 50-80 years with a >/=20-pack-years smoking history who were either current smokers or former smokers who had quit smoking in the previous 15 years (US Preventive Services Task Force 2021 criteria). LungFlag performance was measured 9-12 months before clinical diagnosis. Sensitivity and scenario analyses explored the robustness of base-case assumptions. RESULTS: The budget impact model showed that LungFlag was associated with a total cumulative cost savings of US$2.8 million over 5 years, largely attributable to reduced advanced NSCLC treatment costs (-$4.4 million) as more patients were identified with early stage I rather than stage III/IV disease. Using LungFlag, an estimated 17 additional NSCLC diagnoses were identified, 22 fewer NSCLC-related deaths occurred over 5 years, 50 more patients had stage I NSCLC at diagnosis, and 33 fewer patients had stage III or IV NSCLC at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Using LungFlag to identify candidates for lung cancer screening was estimated to save US$2.8 million over 5 years from a US commercial health plan perspective, largely attributable to reduced costs of treating advanced NSCLC."

We sought to compare bracketed lumpectomy with RFID tag with wire localization with regards to margin status and local recurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a single center retrospective study of patients undergoing bracketed lumpectomy for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive breast cancer with RFID tag or wire localization between January 2018 and July 2024. Bracketing distance, total lumpectomy volume, margin status, and oncologic outcomes were compared. RESULTS: A total of 496 patients underwent bracketed lumpectomy, including 164 with RFID localization and 332 with wire localization, with a median follow-up of 33 months. The median bracketed distance between localization devices was similar between the wire localization group (30.4 mm(3)) and the RFID group (32.3 mm(3), p = 0.181). Median lumpectomy volume was smaller in the wire group (84 cm(3)) compared with the RFID group (107 cm(3), p = 0.004). Positive margin rates were not significantly different between the wire localization compared to the RFID tag group (p = 0.546). Total, local, and distant recurrence rates were comparable between the wire (4.2, 2.7, and 0.9%) and then RFID tag groups (4.3%, [p = 1.000], 3.0%, [p = 1.000], and 1.2%, [p = 0.667], respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate equivalent positive margin, re-excision, and recurrence rates between wire and RFID tag bracketed localization techniques with observed increased median specimen volume with tag localization."

In this study, we report a novel mouse model, \"MolT-II\", with T cells expressing a transgenic T cell receptor (TCR) specific for a Moloney virus envelope-derived, MHC class II-presented peptide epitope. Characterization of MolT-II CD4 T cells revealed that they are dysfunctional, showing severely impaired effector functions, reduced proliferation and increased baseline expression of co-inhibitory receptors such as PD-1, LAG-3 and CTLA-4, likely due to chronic exposure to a self-antigen. We further show that epitope-specific peptide vaccination combined with immune checkpoint blockade is able to restore the function of MolT-II CD4 T cells in vivo, associated with enhanced tumor control in mice. The MolT-II mouse strain thus represents an in vivo model for reversible CD4 T cell dysfunction, allowing the study of the role of CD4 T cell regulation in cancer, mechanisms underlying CD4 T cell dysfunction and exhaustion, and novel immunomodulatory therapies aiming to rescue dysfunctional T cells."

    "abstract": "Store-operated Ca(2)(+) entry (SOCE) is a major pathway for Ca(2)(+) entry that regulates several cellular functions. SOCE remodeling mediated by changes in the expression and/or function of the Orai channels results in the reorganization of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis leading to a variety of pathologies, including cancer. Notably, a significant alteration of Orai function has been reported in breast cancer cells, where the dysregulation of the Notch1 signaling pathway plays a role in the development and progression of cancer hallmarks. Here, we have investigated the possible role of Notch1 in the regulation of the expression of Orai1 and Orai3 in different breast cancer cell lines. Expression of the active form of Notch1, as well as cell stimulation with the Notch1 agonist Jagged-1 (Jag-1), demonstrates a differential role of Notch1 in the regulation of Orai expression in non-tumoral breast epithelial cells and triple negative or luminal breast cancer cells. The role of Notch1 was confirmed using DAPT, a gamma-secretase inhibitor that prevents activation of the Notch pathway. Modulation of Orai1 and Orai3 expression by Notch1 was paralleled by changes in SOCE. The effect in Orai expression mediated by activation of Notch1 signaling pathway was mimicked by the expression of HEY1 or the non-phosphorylatable HEY1-S68A mutant; by contrast, expression of the phosphomimetic HEY1-S68D mutant was without effect on Orai expression. Understanding the Notch1-HEY1-Orai axis might provide insights into the development of subtype-specific therapeutic strategies targeting breast cancer."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study employed cross-lagged panel network (CLPN) analysis to construct a symptom network for colorectal cancer patients at four time points during the perioperative period, aiming to identify predictive relationships and intervention opportunities. METHODS: A total of 315 patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery were enrolled in this study. They were assessed at four time points: preoperatively at admission (T0), and postoperatively on day 1 (T1), day 3 (T2), and on the day of discharge (T3). Symptom severity was evaluated using the MD Anderson Symptom Scale and the colorectal cancer module. Cross-sectional networks were analyzed using Gaussian graphical models (GGM), while CLPN models with LASSO regularization examined directed temporal relationships between symptoms, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: The analysis revealed dynamic changes in core symptoms: vomiting (T0-EI = 1.090), distress (T1/T2-EI > 1.021), and altered bowel habits (T3-EI = 0.461). Overall network strength significantly decreased from T2 to T3 (p < 0.001). In the T0-T1 band, sadness at admission (OEI = 0.684) predicted vomiting (edge weight = 0.297), low mood (0.183), and dry mouth (0.088) on postoperative day 1; in the T1-T2 band, low mood at T1 (OEI = 0.651) predicted altered stool characteristics (0.502) and constipation (0.370) at T2. Vomiting and altered stool characteristics showed incoming predictability of 0.41 and 0.45, respectively. CONCLUSION: Preoperative emotional symptoms play a key predictive role in subsequent gastrointestinal symptoms. By intervening in psychological stress and intestinal dysfunction before and immediately after surgery, it may be possible to interrupt the symptom transmission pathway. Symptom network analysis provides actionable targets for precision intervention."

    "abstract": "T cells are central components of the adaptive immune system and play key roles in antitumor and antiviral responses. The diverse cell fates of T cells enable them to respond to different durations and strengths of antigen stimulation and various cytokine milieus in a context-dependent manner. During acute infection or vaccination, T cells differentiate into effector cells and later develop into memory cells after antigen clearance, which mediate immune protection against the same antigen. In contrast, during cancer and chronic infection, T cells fail to enter the canonical effector or memory cell differentiation path. Instead, antigen-specific T cells enter a dysfunctional, partially responsive state called exhaustion. Exhausted T cells are heterogeneous. A subset of exhausted T cells exhibits stem cell-like properties. These stem-like T cells sustain immunity through self-renewal and repopulation of terminally differentiated progenies. Stem-like properties are critical for T cell immunity induced by immunotherapy. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling the exhaustion and stemness of T cells and explores the potential of rewiring these circuits to increase the efficiency of T-cell-based immunotherapy."

    "abstract": "Tumor-derived exosome secretion dynamically correlates with malignant progression, although the mechanisms by which tumor-associated antigens regulate exosome production remain unclear. Here, we found that the number of plasma exosomes increased significantly with the progression of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and identified that CD147 as a crucial mediator of exosome secretion using mass spectrometry. CD147 exhibited a positive correlation with exosomes release in NSCLC patients and various cell lines and it drove the release of exosome to promote tumor metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptomic profiling of transgenic CD147 models identified differential gene expression patterns enriched in autophagy-related pathways. Intriguingly, CD147 was found to specifically enhance autophagosome and amphisome biogenesis to promote exosomes release by using transmission electron microscopy, high-sensitivity structured light microscope, RFP-GFP-LC3 adenovirus reporters and immunofluorescence, which indicated the role of CD147 in mediating non-canonical autophagy processes. Mechanistically, CD147 activated the GCN2/EIF2alpha/ATG12 signaling axis to drive autophagosome assembly but blocked autolysosome maturation by inhibiting VAMP8/STX17/SNAP29-dependent fusion, leading to amphisome accumulation. Proteomics identified TRIM56 as a novel E3 ligase mediating K619 ubiquitination-dependent GCN2 proteasomal degradation. Subsequently, we found that CD147 suppresses TRIM56 expression, thereby stabilizing GCN2 to activate the GCN2/EIF2alpha/ATG12 axis. Meanwhile, CD147-induced IP3R3-mediated calcium overload facilitated the fusion of autophagosomes with multivesicular bodies to form amphisomes, thus enhancing exosome release. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel mechanism whereby CD147 promotes crinophagy-mediated exosome secretion through dual regulation of GCN2 stability and calcium homeostasis, thereby accelerating NSCLC progression. Our work establishes a new molecular link between autophagy modulation and cancer progression."

Since 2013, all German federal states are obliged to record data on diagnosis, pathology, therapy, and clinical course of tumor diseases. We gathered data on MOGCT and SCST from thirteen federal cancer registries and the German Childhood Cancer Registry. Each of the participating registries provided aggregated data on MOGCT and SCST with date of diagnosis between 01.01.2016 and 31.12.2021. 629 MOGCT and 872 SCST were included, age peaks at diagnosis for MOGCT and SCST were between 20 and 24 years and between 55 and 59 years, respectively. Of all MOGCT, 23%, 22%, 13% and 12% were malignant teratoma, dysgerminoma, neuroendocrine tumors and yolk sac tumors, respectively. The large majority (94%) of SCST represented malignant granulosa cell tumors. Most tumors were diagnosed in FIGO stage I (66% of MOGCT and 85% of SCST). Surgery was reported in 58% of patients with MOGCT and in 73% of patients with SCST. Chemotherapy was administered to 26% of MOGCT patients and 8% of SCST patients. This study highlights the great potential of cancer registries as high numbers of patients are recorded, however, data are highly dependent on the reporting institutions."

In this study, we conduct a first-principle density functional theory simulation to investigate the capability of two-dimensional polyaniline (g-C(3)N) for detecting propane and acetaldehyde, as known lung cancer biomarkers. The energetically most favorable configurations of the adsorbed systems were determined, and the computed adsorption energy reveals the non-covalent interaction between biomarkers and g-C(3)N monolayer. As a result, the adsorption process is reversible, which is fundamental for the long lifespan of biosensors in real applications. On the other hand, acetaldehyde physisorption on the g-C(3)N monolayer induces a significant variation in the band gap, suggesting the possible use of g-C(3)N as a resistance-based biosensor. Charge transfer analysis shows that both biomarkers act as electron acceptors from the host material. The capability of the g-C(3)N monolayer to respond to these biomarkers was also investigated upon applying an external electric field. An electric field considerably enhances the interaction between gas molecules and the g-C(3)N monolayer by increasing the adsorption energies and charge transfer values, which are more pronounced for acetaldehyde. The results also show that the g-C(3)N monolayer energy band gap in the presence of biomarkers closes at high electric fields. These findings highlight the ability to adjust the sensing properties of the g-C(3)N monolayer through an external electric field without requiring any structural modifications."

High grade serous ovarian cancer is a lethal disease in the recurrent setting and has not been amenable to ICI therapy. MUC16/CA125 is overexpressed in high grade serous ovarian cancer. BITEs targeting the tumor-retained portion of MUC16/CA125 have recently been described and are in early-phase clinical trials. To identify mechanisms of resistance to BITEs, we collected serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and ascites samples from patients with disease progression on MUC16-directed bispecific antibodies. Analysis of these samples showed downregulation of MUC16/CA125, elevated secretion of VEGF, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in tumor cells. Interestingly, hypoxia was determined to be a driver of these changes. These findings were prospectively validated in ovarian cancer cell lines with CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of MUC16/CA125 and VEGF. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with disease progression were capable of effective cytolysis ex vivo, suggesting that resistance to therapy was primarily tumor driven. Restoration of MUC16/CA125 expression did not restore cytotoxicity in the presence of increased VEGF secretion. Combination treatment with a VEGF inhibitor rescued cytotoxicity in hypoxia-conditioned ovarian cancer cell lines with preserved target antigen expression. Collectively, these data outline a link between hypoxia and the development of resistance to BITEs and posits inhibition of VEGF inhibition as a potentially important therapeutic intervention."

Here, PEGSerp-1 effects on immune-coagulopathic responses is examined in a mouse colitis model. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with life-threatening complications with severe inflammation, bleeding, vasculitis, cancer and toxic megacolon. Serine protease cascades activate coagulation and complement pathways throughout the human body and are regulated by inhibitors, termed serpins, that can reduce gut inflammation. Prophylactic PEGSerp-1 significantly improved survival in severe 5% Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis, reducing inflammation and crypt damage. Colon damage and inflammation were also reduced after either acute colitis induced by 5% DSS or repeat 2% DSS induced colitis. PEGSerp-1 reduced inflammatory M1 macrophage invasion, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), fibrinogen and complement on immunohistochemical analysis. PEGSerp-1 reduced uPAR expression in human macrophage, but not colon cells.

This study aimed to validate the Hungarian version of the Minneapolis-Manchester Quality of Life Instrument - Adolescent Form (MMQL-AF) and explore factors associated with HRQoL among adolescents and young people with cancer. Ninety-two patients with cancer (46 receiving active treatment and 46 >/= 1 year post-treatment) and 46 healthy controls completed the MMQL-AF. The MMQL-AF was translated into Hungarian in accordance with Beaton et al. and TARES (2024) guidelines. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). Validity was evaluated by correlations with the Hungarian Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL 4.0) and by comparing scores across groups. Five items were removed during confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to improve model fit. The MMQL-AF demonstrated acceptable reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.73-0.90; ICC 0.78-0.96; RMSEA = 0.062; 90% CI: 0.055-0.069; CFI = 0.828; TLI = 0.814; SRMR = 0.079; GFI = 0.962) and strong concurrent validity with PedsQL scores. Cancer patients reported significantly lower HRQoL than healthy peers (mean 3.58 vs. 3.81; mean difference 0.23; 95% CI: 0.05-0.41; p = 0.012). No significant difference emerged between patients on active treatment and patients off treatment. Patients with bone, soft-tissue, or central nervous system tumors reported worse outcomes (p = 0.015). Positive parental relationships were strongly associated with a better outlook (p < 0.001). The Hungarian MMQL-AF demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity for assessing HRQoL among adolescents and young people with cancer. Tumor type and family environment were associated with differences in the well-being of the patients.

This study evaluates the use of minibeam radiation therapy (MBRT), delivered through a novel 3D-printed collimator made of polylactic acid (PLA) and tungsten, to modulate the TNBC microenvironment and potentially overcome radioresistance. Three collimator configurations (400, 600, 800 mum beam widths) were tested. Mice received MBRT (150 Gy) or conventional radiotherapy (CRT, 7 or 15 Gy), with tumor responses assessed using histology, RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. The measured beam FWHM values for the MBRT 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 groups were 419 +/- 23 mum, 575 +/- 31 mum, and 798 +/- 50 mum, respectively, while the CTC distances were 832 +/- 25 mum, 1296 +/- 21 mum, and 1651 +/- 49 mum. MBRT generated stable, spatially fractionated dose distributions with high peak-to-valley ratios. Compared to CRT at equivalent valley doses, MBRT significantly reduced tumor growth, proliferation, and hypoxia while increasing necrosis. Mechanistically, MBRT downregulated HIF-1alpha/VEGFR signaling, alleviating hypoxia and angiogenesis, and enhanced vascular normalization via increased pericyte coverage. These findings suggest MBRT reprograms the TNBC microenvironment, supporting its potential as a radiosensitizing strategy for clinical translation."

Despite the growing applications of AI for cancer molecular subtype classification, challenges persist due to non-standardized dataset configurations, diverse omics modalities, and inconsistent evaluation measures. These issues limit the comparability, reproducibility, and generalizability of AI classifiers across different cancers and hinder the development of robust and accurate AI-driven tools. This study performs comparative analyses of 35 unique AI classifiers across 153 datasets, covering 8 omics modalities and 20 different cancers. Particularly, it investigates 6 different research questions, and based on comprehensive performance analyses of the 35 AI classifiers it elucidates the research questions with the following answers: (i) out of 17 different configurations for 5 out of the 8 tested omics modalities, RPPA (RPPA), Gistic2-all-data-by-genes (CNV), HM27 (Meth), and HiSeqV2-exon (Exon) configurations consistently yield better performance; (ii) in terms of 8 omics modalities, RNASeq, miRNA, CNV, and Exon generally achieve higher macro-accuracy (MACC) compared to Meth., Array, SNP and RPPA; (iii) SNP and RPPA modalities are prone to biases due to technical noise; (iv) traditional machine learning (ML) models (SVM, XGB, HGB) perform best on small and low-dimensional datasets, while deep learning (DL) models (ResNet18, CNN, NN, MLP) excel on large and high-dimensional datasets; (v) SVM achieves the highest mean MACC across all classifiers, with NN, ResNet18, DEEPGENE, and MLP also demonstrate strong performance; and (vi) DL classifiers show superior MACC as compared to ML classifiers in 12 out of 20 cancers. The findings offer key insights to guide the development of standardized, robust, and efficient AI-driven pipelines for cancer molecular subtype classification. This study enhances reproducibility and facilitates better comparison across AI methods, ultimately advancing precision oncology."

    "abstract": "Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is associated with improved survival in recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) but carries a high risk of postoperative complications. Accurate perioperative risk stratification remains an unmet need. To develop and internally validate a perioperative risk model for postoperative complications in ROC patients using information available by the end of surgery (pre- and intra-operative data), and to compare logistic regression (LR) and artificial neural networks (ANN) as possible predictive models. A retrospective analysis of 71 patients treated with CRS and HIPEC between 2011 and 2022 was performed. Clinical, surgical, and perioperative variables were analysed. Predictors were restricted to variables available at or before the end of the index operation, which prevents information leakage by using only data available at prediction time. LR and ANN models were developed and assessed with cross-validation. Performance reporting followed TRIPOD (Type b) and TRIPOD + AI, with Brier score, and calibration slope/intercept from out‑of‑fold (OOF) predictions. Thresholded metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC) were summarised at a prespecified probability cut-off. Exploratory univariate odds ratio analyses with Holm-adjusted p-values were used to explore procedure-complication associations. Postoperative complications occurred in 45% of patients. LR identified blood loss (p = 0.005) and number of procedures (p = 0.042) as significant predictors of complications. The LR model achieved an accuracy of 66.2%, precision of 64.3%, recall of 56.2%, F1 score of 60.0%, and AUC of 0.700. The ANN model achieved an accuracy of 97.2%, precision of 94.3%, recall of 100%, F1 score of 97.1%, and AUC of 0.967. Hysterectomy with adnexa (OR = 11.67, p = 0.035) and metastasectomy (OR = 7.42, p = 0.042) were significantly associated with higher postoperative complication rates. ANN demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to LR in identifying postoperative complications after CRS and HIPEC, as indicated by ROC analysis. Combining traditional statistical modelling with modern machine learning may enhance ROC for perioperative risk stratification after CRS with HIPEC. A well-calibrated, interpretable LR model together with a highly discriminative ANN could enable more tailored allocation of intensive care resources and earlier identification of high-risk patients, potentially improving the safety of this demanding but beneficial treatment. However, external multicentre validation is required before clinical implementation."

The efficacy of chemotherapy after TME without LLND remains unclear, so we aimed to assess this efficacy. We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent TME without LLND and received adjuvant chemotherapy between January 2010 and December 2020 at our institution. Relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Prognostic factors for RFS, including tumor location, chemotherapy regimen, and T and N factors were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Of 197 patients, 117 were eligible. The median age was 66 years (range 26-82). Tumor locations were Ra and Rb in 67 (57%) and 50 (43%) patients. Eighty (68%) and 37 (32%) patients received fluoropyrimidine monotherapy (single agent) and oxaliplatin-based therapy (doublet) as adjuvant chemotherapy. The 3-year RFS rate and 3-year OS rate were 73.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.7-81.0%) and 95.5% (95% CI, 89.6-98.1%), respectively. In the univariate and multivariate analysis, none of these variables were identified as independent prognostic factors for RFS. TME without LLND followed by adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with RC demonstrated favorable 3-year RFS and OS rates."

    "abstract": "Quercetin is a naturally occurring flavonoid widely recognized for its potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. However, its clinical application is limited by low water solubility and poor bioavailability. In this study, the complexation of quercetin with iron (II) ions was systematically investigated through electrochemical, spectroscopic, biological, and computational techniques to improve its physicochemical and pharmacological performance. Cyclic voltammetry revealed that quercetin undergoes irreversible oxidation due to semiquinone and para-quinonemethide formation, while Fe(II) exhibited quasi-reversible redox behavior, which became less reversible upon complexation, suggesting altered electron transfer kinetics. The stability constant (log betaMX = 3.29) and the negative Gibbs free energy (DeltaG = - 19.07 kJ/mol) confirmed spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable complex formation. UV-Vis spectroscopy showed significant bathochromic shifts (Deltalambda = 66 nm), and the continuous variation method established a 1:1 metal-to-ligand stoichiometry. (1)H NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction patterns further confirmed the coordination sites and structural modifications upon metal binding. The Fe(II)-quercetin complex demonstrated superior antioxidant capacity in DPPH radical scavenging assays, with an IC(5)(0) of 21.86 microg/mL compared to 23.47 microg/mL for free quercetin, confirming enhanced radical scavenging activity upon complexation. Cytotoxicity assays on HepG2 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines revealed enhanced bioactivity of the complex, with IC(5)(0) values of 26.80 and 18.60 microM, respectively. Antifungal testing showed moderate inhibition against Candida albicans. Molecular docking simulations using the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (PDB: 7JWY) indicated stronger binding affinity for the complex (- 5.42 kcal/mol) than quercetin alone, suggesting potential antiviral efficacy. Additionally, DFT calculations revealed increased softness and electrophilicity of the complex, supporting its enhanced reactivity. Collectively, these findings position the Fe(II)-quercetin complex as a promising multifunctional agent with potential applications in antioxidant therapy, cancer treatment, and antiviral drug development."

Chronic hepatitis B further leads for the risk of liver function failure, liver cancer and serious scarring of the liver called cirrhosis. The objective of the current study was to investigate the prevalence of chronic hepatitis b virus infection and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care at Felege Hiwot Comprehensive Specialized Hospital Ethiopia. Institutional based retrospective cross sectional study design was conducted at Felege Hiwot Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. To measure the prevalence of hepatitis B infection in the study area, testing of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was conducted over time. The study was conducted among 221 pregnant women who have attended antenatal care. Systematic random sampling technique was conducted for the selection of participants in the current study. The overall prevalence of hepatitis B virus among pregnant women in the current study was 4.55%. Among 221 pregnant women taken as study participants, 49 of them who had history of medical illness were screened for hepatitis B surface antigen and among these 25 had positive result, yielding a sensitivity (95% confidence interval) of 80% (70 - 88.5) and a specificity of 96.8% (93.7 - 98.4) for Healgen and Determine; 91.6 - 96.5 for Advanced Quality).

The prevalence of hepatitis B virus was significantly affected by history of blood transfusion, history of alcohol consuming, history of contact an individual with liver disease, having multiple sexual partners, body tattoo and history of genital mutilation. The first step during ANC shall be screening of HBV infection for pregnant women under the follow up period to take remedial action. The current study recommends conducting health education campaigns to make awareness about HBV transmission and prevention among pregnant women."

    "abstract": "Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) represents a prevalent endocrine neoplasm. Dysregulated tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (TACSTD2) expression is functionally involved in the progression of multiple cancers. Nonetheless, the biological molecular mechanisms underlying TACSTD2 in PTC remain unclear. To verify the biological function of TACSTD2 in PTC, we conducted loss- and gain-of-function experiments, namely, cell proliferation (Cell Counting Kit-8), EdU incorporation, colony formation, and transwell migration/invasion assays, along with establishing a nude mouse xenograft tumor model. Our findings revealed that TACSTD2 knockout impeded PTC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and reduced tumorigenicity in vivo. In contrast, TACSTD2 overexpression reversed these effects in vitro. Through integrated bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation, TACSTD2 was recognized as a downstream target of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)-modulated N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification. In an m6A-dependent manner, METTL3 reduced TACSTD2 mRNA stability. m6A-mediated degradation of TACSTD2 mRNA was reliant on the m6A reader protein YTHDC2. As evidenced by rescue experiments, TACSTD2 overexpression resulted in a partial restoration of the METTL3-induced tumor-suppressive phenotype. Finally, the METTL3/TACSTD2/YTHDC2 axis was confirmed to be an inhibitor in PTC and activates the TNF signaling to promote cell apoptosis and inhibit the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Collectively, METTL3-modulated m6A modification of TACSTD2 exerts an indispensable tumor-suppressive function in PTC progression. The METTL3/TACSTD2/YTHDC2 axis may serve as a molecular target for PTC therapy."

We engineered neutral multilamellar soy-lecithin liposomes co-encapsulating beta-carotene (BC) and doxorubicin (DOX). Thin-film hydration produced vesicles with a DLS Z-average of 122.4 +/- 83.4 nm (PDI = 0.534) and zeta-potential of - 25.6 +/- 8.0 mV, and a TEM diameter of 184 +/- 34 nm, with > 90% entrapment efficiency for both cargos. In HCT-116 cells the formulation preserved DOX potency (IC(5)(0), microg mL(-)(1), mean +/- SD: free DOX 610.9 +/- 11.4; DOX-Lipo 614.0 +/- 1.8; BC-DOX-Lipo 618.9 +/- 5.8) and remained ~ 1.5-fold more active than BC alone (free BC 960.6 +/- 13.6; BC-Lipo 951.8 +/- 18.8). Annexin V/PI flow cytometry showed that BC-DOX-Lipo achieved the highest total apoptosis (44.51 +/- 4.45%) and deep G(0)/G(1) arrest (92.06 +/- 9.2%), reducing S-phase to 6.37 +/- 0.60% (p = 0.0186 vs DOX-Lipo). Alkaline comet analysis indicated that co-delivery modestly attenuated DOX-associated DNA fragmentation (tailed cells 11.43 +/- 0.45% for BC-DOX-Lipo vs 16.27 +/- 0.25% for DOX-Lipo, p < 0.001), consistent with BC's redox buffering. Differential scanning calorimetry and FTIR supported drug-bilayer interactions: BC slightly increased Tm and acyl-chain order, whereas DOX disrupted cooperativity; co-loading shifted T(m) to 37.84  degrees C and broadened the transition, indicating a more fluid bilayer at 37  degrees C. In-silico ADMET profiling (contextual, not in-vivo PK) highlighted superior oral absorption and BBB penetration for BC and negligible oral uptake for DOX; docking predicted higher DOX affinities across Bcl-2, beta-catenin, P-glycoprotein, and topoisomerase II (e.g., - 9.06 to - 9.30 kcal mol(-)(1)) relative to BC ( approximately  - 7.6 to - 7.8 kcal mol(-)(1)). Overall, liposomal co-delivery maintains DOX cytotoxicity while strengthening G(1)/S checkpoint blockade and increasing programmed cell death, with partial moderation of DNA fragmentation. These in-vitro data motivate stability optimization and in-vivo evaluation in CRC models."

    "abstract": "Glucocorticoids (GCs) are known for their anti-inflammatory potential, which includes the macrophage polarization into an anti-inflammatory and tissue remodeling state. GCs are routinely co-administered to cancer patients to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy. However, it is not well known if GCs can modulate tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to promote tumor progression. Here, we show that dexamethasone (DEX) induces dose-dependent differentiation of THP-1 monocyte-derived anti-tumorigenic (M1) macrophages into pro-tumorigenic (M2-like) macrophages, even in the presence of M1 cues, and that DEX can repolarize fully differentiated M1 macrophages into an M2-like state. These macrophages have a cytokine profile similar to the pro-tumorigenic (M2) macrophages and can stimulate the proliferation and invasion of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells in vitro. DEX treatment of an orthotopic mouse model of TNBC attenuated paclitaxel-mediated tumor growth inhibition, increased M2-like TAMs in primary tumors, and enhanced lung metastasis. Transcriptomic analysis of DEX-treated M1 macrophages revealed not only transcriptomic overlap with M2 macrophages, but also with human breast cancer TAM transcriptomic data, and further to a specific TAM signature associated with aggressive estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer. Our study illustrates a remarkable macrophage repolarization plasticity upon DEX exposure that can promote tumorigenesis, warranting care in prescribing high doses of GCs to breast cancer patients, especially to those considered for chemotherapy."

We investigated the expression and clinical relevance of CD44 in colorectal cancer (CRC) and explored its synergistic interaction with p-ERK1/2 in predicting metastatic risk. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD44 and p-ERK1/2 was performed in tissue microarray from 1,137 primary CRC cases. Associations with clinicopathological parameters and survival outcomes were analyzed using Chi-square tests, Kaplan-Meier curves and logistic regression models. CD44 was over expressed in 47.7% (542/1,137) cases and was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.0042), stage III disease (p = 0.0045), high-grade tumors (p = 0.0111), deficient mismatch repair status (p = 0.0007), high Ki-67 (p = 0.0051) and p-ERK1/2 expressions (p = 0.0012). However, CD44 alone did not predict survival outcomes (overall survival and disease-free survival). Co-expression of CD44 and p-ERK1/2 was observed in 284 cases (25.3%) and was significantly associated with stage III/IV disease (p = 0.0022), lymph node involvement (p = 0.0117) and metachronous distant metastasis (p = 0.0404). Co-expression emerged as an independent predictor of distant metastasis in multivariate analysis (Odds ratio = 1.73; 95% confidence interval = 1.11-2.69; p = 0.0149). CD44 and p-ERK1/2 co-expression defines a high-risk subset of CRC patients with increased metastatic potential.

However, diagnostic subjectivity among pathologists and the complex interrelationships between these indicators present significant challenges. Additionally, the high resolution of whole slide images (WSIs) complicates large-scale annotation efforts. To address these issues, we propose a multi-task learning model utilizing self-supervised pre-trained weights from extensive pathological datasets. The model integrates four indicators-severity of inflammation, atrophy, acute activity, and intestinal metaplasia-training on WSIs to predict these indicators while accounting for their interrelationships. Our results show that multi-task learning outperforms single-task models, achieving higher accuracy across all indicators. This model can thus serve as an auxiliary tool for evaluating non-tumor gastric diseases and supporting diagnosis."

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were performed on one VHL germline mutation ccRCC and six non-VHL germline mutation ccRCC samples. We revealed the gene expression characteristics of ccRCC with VHL germline mutation. The frameshift mutations in OBP2A and BCR1, and the elevated expression of COX7A1 were most specific characteristics of ccRCC tumor cells with VHL mutation. And the extensive infiltration of exhausted T cells was the characteristic of tumor microenvironment. In addition, we discovered the relationship between genetic mutations and immune checkpoints.

However, the regulatory molecules of Sonic Hedgehog signaling during NSCLC development are still largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that HHIP Like 2 (HHIPL2) is a crucial Sonic Hedgehog signaling regulator, accelerating NSCLC progression via positively governing Sonic Hedgehog signaling. Clinically, HHIPL2 is highly expressed in NSCLC and indicates a poor prognosis. Consistently, via depletion or gain of HHIPL2 in vivo and in vitro, we identified its oncogenic role in NSCLC proliferation and metastasis. Mechanistically, HHIPL2 interacted with the RNA-binding protein HNRNPC to alter its nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation. HHIPL2-regulated HNRNPC accumulation in the cytoplasm promoted the mRNA stability of HNF1A, a transcription factor for SHH, which subsequently enhanced the Sonic Hedgehog signaling activity to facilitate NSCLC progression. Furthermore, we discovered that triptolide (TPL), an HNF1A inhibitor, impeded HHIPL2-mediated Sonic Hedgehog signaling activation and NSCLC malignancy. Therefore, our findings not only uncover a previously unrecognized role for HHIPL2 in regulating the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway but also highlight a novel HHIPL2/HNRNPC/HNF1A axis as an attractive target for NSCLC therapy.Schematic diagram (created by Figdraw.com) showing that HHIPL2 positively governs Hedgehog signaling to accelerate NSCLC progression via enhancing HNRNPC-mediated HNF1A mRNA stabilization."

    "abstract": "Most neuroendocrine cancers lack caspase 8 protein expression. While this feature was thought to facilitate escape from extrinsic apoptosis, its cancer-regulatory function has remained unexplored. Here, we devise a mouse model of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) recapitulating the lack of expression of caspase 8 seen in humans and uncover an unexpected role for necroptosis-fueled pre-tumoral inflammation resulting in reprogramming towards a neuronal progenitor cell-like state and increased metastatic disease. Notably, transcriptional signatures of this cellular state are enriched in relapsed and metastatic human SCLC. Mechanistically, caspase 8 loss within the pre-tumoral niche promotes inflammation marked by increased recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) which are responsible for the promotion of metastatic disease. Importantly, inactivation of the necroptosis executioner MLKL reverses pre-tumoral inflammation, decreases metastasis as well as neuronal-like reprogramming. Taken together, our findings suggest that pre-tumoral inflammatory cell death contributes to neuronal progenitor mimicry, immunosuppression and increased metastasis in SCLC."

    "abstract": "Adult stem cells (SCs) transition between quiescent and active states to maintain tissue integrity, and dysregulation of this balance can lead to tissue degeneration, cancer, or premature aging. Both intrinsic factors and extrinsic niche signals influence these states; however, the molecular mechanisms that integrate extrinsic cues with intrinsic programs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the conserved repressive histone mark, H2AK119ub, serves as a molecular switch linking inhibitory fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signals with the quiescent transcriptional program in hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). Modulation of FGF signaling is associated with changes in H2AK119ub levels, thereby toggling HFSCs between quiescence and activation states. Mechanistically, H2AK119ub directly represses a proliferation-promoting transcriptional program preserving HFSC quiescence. Loss of H2AK119ub in HFSCs shortens the quiescent phase and induces repeated rounds of HFSC activation, ultimately leading to SC exhaustion - a hallmark of aging tissue. Analysis of other mammalian SC systems and Drosophila germline SCs confirms that H2AK119ub is a broadly conserved hallmark of quiescence and is dynamic upon SC activation. These findings reveal a signaling-epigenetic axis that controls SC quiescence and underscores the importance of the conserved role of H2AK119ub in maintaining tissue homeostasis."

This study shows that Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri)'s inherent bioactivities, including proliferation, metabolism, and colorectal colonization, can be enhanced by manganese, prompting the fabrication of a manganese-engineered strain (MnLR). Oral administration of MnLR with its metabolic substrate-glycerol (MnLR/Gly) promotes the enrichment of L. reuteri and its antitumor metabolites within colon tumors. Across multiple preclinical colon tumor models, MnLR/Gly alone achieves a 95.6% inhibition of orthotopic tumor growth, liver metastases reduction by 62.1%, and confers durable protection, with 75% of prophylactically treated mice remaining long-term tumor-free and 62.5% resisting tumor rechallenge. Mechanistically, MnLR/Gly induces both intratumoral and peripheral dendritic cell maturation, M1 macrophage polarization, and effector T-cell responses. In orthotopic CRC rabbit models, GlyMnLR enteric capsules demonstrate significant antitumor efficacy comparable to standard chemotherapy while exhibiting favorable safety. These findings highlight MnLR as an effective standalone probiotic therapy for CRC prevention and treatment."

    "abstract": "The poor prognosis of bladder cancer (BCa) is primarily attributed to the acquisition of invasive and metastatic capabilities by tumor cells through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), yet the dynamic alterations in ferroptosis during EMT and their regulatory mechanisms remain unelucidated. This study is the first to reveal the mechanism by which the Smad3/CISD2 signaling axis regulates ferroptosis in mesenchymal-like bladder cancer cells. Clinical sample analysis demonstrated significantly reduced expression of E-cadherin and upregulation of N-cadherin and Vimentin in muscle-invasive bladder cancer tissues (MIBC), with EMT-related marker levels correlating with overall survival rates in BCa patients. In TGF-beta1-induced mesenchymal-like bladder cancer cells, ferroptosis-related genes (GPX4, SLC7A11) were markedly elevated, alongside increased lipid peroxides (LPO) and glutathione (GSH) levels. However, mesenchymal-like bladder cancer cells exhibited heightened sensitivity to the ferroptosis inducer Erastin, showing more pronounced suppression of proliferation, elevated ROS, higher LPO and MDA levels, and reduced GSH, confirming their enhanced susceptibility to ferroptosis. RNA-seq revealed significant downregulation of Smad3 in ferroptosis inducer treated mesenchymal-like bladder cancer cells. Smad3 knockdown further exacerbated ferroptosis markers (elevated Fe(2)(+), ROS, LPO; decreased GSH), inhibited migration, invasion, and proliferation-phenotypes reversible by ferroptosis inhibitors. Mechanistically, ChIP-seq combined with RNA-seq demonstrated that Smad3 regulates CISD2 expression by binding its promoter region, with clinical specimens confirming a positive correlation between Smad3 and CISD2 expression. Functional rescue experiments showed that CISD2 overexpression in Smad3-knockdown mesenchymal-like bladder cancer cells reversed abnormal increases in Fe(2)(+), ROS, LPO, and MDA while restoring GSH levels, indicating that Smad3 modulates ferroptosis through a CISD2-dependent pathway. In vivo experiments further demonstrated that targeting the Smad3/CISD2 axis significantly suppressed xenograft tumor growth and activated ferroptosis. In conclusion, this study elucidates a novel mechanism by which the Smad3/CISD2 axis dynamically regulates ferroptosis through redox homeostasis reprogramming during EMT, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting the progression of MIBC."

    "abstract": "Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with radiotherapy serving as a cornerstone of treatment. However, the development of radioresistance significantly compromises therapeutic efficacy and patient outcomes. Through integrative analysis of TCGA and GEO datasets combined with quantitative proteomics, we identified acetyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSS1) as a key driver of radioresistance in breast cancer. ACSS1 is aberrantly overexpressed in breast cancer and correlates with poor prognosis following radiotherapy. Functional studies revealed that overexpressed ACSS1 is able to enhance radioresistance both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ACSS1 amplifies the ionizing radiation (IR)-induced metabolic coupling of pyruvate with ROS for acetate synthesis, which fuels energy production and expands the nuclear acetyl-CoA pool, enabling histone acetylation at DNA damage sites. Such acetylation promotes chromatin relaxation at damage sites, facilitating the recruitment of homologous recombination (HR) repair machinery and ultimately leading to radioresistance. Our findings reveal that ACSS1 orchestrates acetyl-CoA-driven histone acetylation to enhance DNA repair efficiency, highlighting a metabolic-epigenetic crosstalk that sustains radioresistance in breast cancer. Targeting ACSS1 represents a promising therapeutic strategy to sensitize tumours to radiotherapy and improve clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients."

Among these, 5-methylcytosine (m(5)C) RNA methylation-a ubiquitous and conserved epitranscriptomic mark-has been identified across diverse RNA species, including mRNAs, rRNAs, tRNAs, and mitochondrial RNAs. Notably, the RNA m(5)C \"writers\"-enzymes responsible for installing this modification onto target RNAs-have emerged as central regulators of tumorigenesis, with NSUN (NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase) proteins playing a particularly pivotal role. We synthesize current knowledge of the cellular localization, substrate specificity, and biological functions of m(5)C-modifying enzymes, focusing predominantly on the NSUN family in the cancer context. We first dissect the spatiotemporal regulation patterns of NSUN proteins-from their nuclear roles in pre-mRNA processing to cytoplasmic functions in mRNA decay and translation-and their conserved methyltransferase domains that dictate target RNA recognition. This review further explores the molecular mechanisms by which NSUN proteins govern tumor progression, metastasis, and therapeutic responses, emphasizing their dual roles in both initiating oncogenic programs and maintaining cancer cell plasticity. Finally, we discuss the translational implications of targeting NSUN-mediated m(5)C pathways, highlighting small-molecule inhibitors designed against NSUN substrate specificity, combinatorial strategies with conventional chemotherapy or immunotherapy, and the promise of epitranscriptomic diagnostics and prognostic based on NSUN expression signatures. By positioning NSUN proteins as integral nodes in the RNA epigenomic network, this synthesis not only deepens our understanding of cancer pathogenesis but also identifies novel epitranscriptomic targets for precision oncology."

At this prespecified interim analysis, culmerciclib plus fulvestrant extended the median investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) significantly, the primary endpoint, as compared with placebo plus fulvestrant (16.6 months, 95% CI 13.8 to not evaluable versus 7.5 months, 95% CI 5.3 to 11.0; hazard ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.26-0.51; stratified log rank test P < 0.001). Consistent effects were observed across diverse subgroups of patients. At a median follow-up duration of 13.8 months, overall survival was immature. The investigators-assessed objective response rate was 40.2% (95% CI, 33.3-47.5) for culmerciclib compared to 12.1% (95% CI 6.4-20.2) for placebo (stratified Mantel-Haenszel chi(2) test P < 0.001). Diarrhea (87.1%) and neutropenia (80.4%) were the most common toxicities with culmerciclib plus fulvestrant. In conclusion, this randomized clinical trial met its primary outcome. Culmerciclib plus fulvestrant is well tolerated and leads to a significant gain in PFS of pretreated HR-positive HER2-negative ABC patients."

    "abstract": "Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing a surgeon's ability to locate and resect all malignant lesions, thereby improving a patient's probability of survival. While several tumor-targeted near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores have been developed to image selected cancer types, no single tumor-targeted dye has been found to image all cancers. To remedy this deficiency, we have examined the ability of a fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-targeted NIR fluorophore to broad-spectrum solid tumors when combined with pafolacianine (OTL-38, Cytalux). Pafolacianine was selected for this imaging cocktail because it highlights all cells that express either folate receptor alpha (a receptor that is expressed on  approximately 40% of human cancers) or folate receptor beta (a related receptor expressed on tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells). An FAP-targeted conjugate of the same near-infrared fluorescent dye (S0456) was also selected because it targets myofibroblasts that infiltrate virtually all solid tumors but are essentially absent from healthy tissues. In this paper, we describe the design, synthesis, and characterization of a novel FAP ligand (FAP9) and determine its affinity (K(d)  approximately  2 nM) and specificity (>2000-fold over homologous enzymes) for FAP. We then quantify its ability to image many different cancer types in murine tumor models and combine it in different ratios with pafolacianine to determine the ratio that yields the highest total tumor fluorescence and tumor-to-background ratio in seven tumor models. Because the combination of the two fluorescent conjugates invariably images tumors better than either conjugate alone, and since the two-dye combination displays no obvious toxicities, we propose that a cocktail of FAP9-S0456 plus pafolacianine warrants evaluation as a candidate for intraoperative imaging of all human tumors."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) is a preferred method for the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Two techniques of radiotherapy have been used in TNT trials so far, including long-course chemoradiotherapy (LCRT) and short-course radiotherapy (SCRT). However, to date, no study compares these techniques in a head-to-head fashion. Our objective is to compare the complete clinical response among patients with LARC who receive long or short-course radiation therapy in combination with the same chemotherapy regimen. METHODS: 158 patients (18-80 years old) with standard or high-risk LARC (T3/T4 tumor or lymph node positive) located at least 5 cm from the anal verge will be randomized into two groups: LCRT (with a dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 sessions) or SCRT (with a dose of 25 Gy in five sessions). Both of these groups will receive concurrent chemotherapy (capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) twice daily) followed by consolidation chemotherapy with the CAPEOX regimen for 6 cycles or mFOLFOX7 for 9 cycles. We will compare the complete clinical response (initially 12-16 weeks after the last RT fraction and eventually 2 weeks after the last chemotherapy cycle) by MRI as the primary endpoint. Overall survival (OS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), local control, and toxicities will be evaluated after 3-5 years as the secondary endpoints. DISCUSSION: Advances in the treatment of rectal cancer focus on metastasis control, besides local control by using neoadjuvant therapy. Determining the complete clinical response, OS, and MFS of short-course versus long-course chemoradiation will assist in choosing the best LARC treatment protocol.

It is a therapeutic bronchoscopic intervention for both benign and malignant conditions, being mostly performed with a palliative intent, especially in cases of malignant central airway obstruction (CAO).We report a previously undocumented complication of airway stenting-disintegration of a self-expanding metallic stent (SEMS) and its spontaneous expectoration. A man in his late 40s with newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the lung presented with CAO and respiratory failure. Rigid bronchoscopy with tumour debulking and Y-SEMS placement was performed, resulting in clinical stabilisation. Four-and-a-half months post-stenting, the patient presented with expectoration of metallic fragments. Bronchoscopy revealed extensive disintegration of the posterior wall of the tracheal limb of the stent, with the bronchial limbs intact. The disintegrated stent was carefully removed under rigid bronchoscopy without any complications. Given adequate airway patency, no replacement stent was inserted. The patient continued systemic chemotherapy and remained stable, with no recurrence of airway compromise. This case highlights an unusual delayed complication of airway stenting."

    "abstract": "A phantom or vanishing tumour of the lung is an uncommon radiographic finding, often linked to fluid overload conditions such as heart failure or chronic kidney disease. It is characterised by the presence of interlobular effusion within the transverse or oblique fissure of the right lung. Despite its infrequency, it is a significant differential diagnosis for radiographic opacities in the right middle lung zone, given its potential to mimic more ominous pathologies such as neoplastic masses or infiltrative processes.In this report, we present a case involving a man in his 70s who presented with a 10-day history of productive cough, chest pain and shortness of breath. An initial chest X-ray (CXR) showed a well-defined, dense, round mass in the right lower lobe. An echocardiogram revealed a significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Following the initiation of loop diuretics and fluid restriction, the mass-like opacity completely disappeared on follow-up CXR after 7 days, confirming the diagnosis of a vanishing tumour. This case highlights the critical importance of addressing the underlying heart failure prior to considering further invasive diagnostic procedures, as this can help avoid unnecessary, expensive, and potentially harmful interventions."

    "abstract": "Head and neck cancers (HNCs) represent a heterogeneous group of malignancies, predominantly composed of squamous cell carcinoma. Radiotherapy (RT), either alone or concurrently with chemotherapy, remains a central component of definitive and adjuvant treatment in HNCs. The success of radiotherapy depends on precise target volume delineation, which relies heavily on advanced imaging techniques. Positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) is well-established in RT planning workflows and endorsed by international guidelines. Recent advances in molecular imaging using fibroblast activation protein inhibitors (FAPI) targeting PET tracers offer improved tumor visualization and target delineation with early studies demonstrating more distinct tumor margins and improved diagnostic performance compared with FDG PET in HNCs. These advantages align with the critical need for highly reliable imaging in a disease site where complex anatomy complicates RT delivery. Early findings suggest a promising role for FAPI PET, in refining gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation and complementing current RT workflows. Despite the promising findings, current evidence is limited to small, primarily single-center cohorts, some with heterogeneous tumor subtypes, and the absence of prospective outcome-based validation. In addition, the utility of FAPI PET in post-RT response assessment and the optimal timing of imaging has yet to be clear defined. Rigorous, methodologically well-designed prospective studies are needed to establish the clinical value, prognostic significance, and impact of FAPI PET on radiotherapy outcomes in HNCs."

    "abstract": "Radium-223 ((223)Ra), an alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical targets bone and prolongs overall survival (OS) while reducing skeletal-related events (SREs) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients (mCRPC). However, assessing (223)Ra therapeutic response is difficult due to its distinct mechanism of action on bone remodeling and tumor microenvironment. Therefore, a multimodal approach to evaluate response is required, beyond conventional serum tumor biomarkers such as PSA and ALP. This review integrates current and emerging strategies for evaluating (223)Ra response. We discuss classic serum biomarkers, highlighting their prognostic and monitoring roles. We also examine emerging liquid biopsy tools, such as circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, bone metabolism markers and exosomes that may reflect the metabolic changes induced by (223)Ra. We also explore the clinical response patterns and limitations of imaging biomarkers that play a central role in response assessment such as (18)F-fluoride PET/CT, whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI and PSMA PET/CT. We cover RECIST-based assessments and innovative technologies, including radiomics and artificial intelligence, that integrate clinical, molecular, and imaging data to enhance outcome prediction, automate lesion analysis, and reveal patterns related to treatment response, supporting personalized care. In conclusion, a multimodal approach that combines biological and imaging markers with modern analytical methods enhances (223)Ra therapy response evaluation, leading to improved clinical outcomes in mCRPC."

We investigates the first-in-human positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of prostatic acid phosphatase (ACP3), a novel and highly specific PC target, using the radioligand [(68)Ga]Ga-OncoACP3-DOTA. We analyzed and matched [(68)Ga]Ga-OncoACP3-DOTA and [(18)F]PSMA-1007 PET scans in a cohort of 25 patients with PC. We compared the biodistribution and tumor uptake of the two tracers using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and compared their performance. Superiority was defined as >10% more lesions detected or >50% higher lesional maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)). [(68)Ga]Ga-OncoACP3-DOTA showed low background uptake, including in the salivary glands and kidneys, with a significant difference from the high [(18)F]PSMA-1007 uptake in these organs (p < 0.002). Overall, SUV(max) in localized or metastatic PC did not significantly differ between the two tracers. Better [(68)Ga]Ga-OncoACP3-DOTA performance was observed in 11/25 matched scan pairs, and better [(18)F]PSMA-1007 performance in eight of 25 pairs. [(68)Ga]Ga-OncoACP3-DOTA changed therapeutic management in three of six patients with biochemical recurrence, and in two of 12 patients with known metastases. Although the retrospective comparison is potentially biased, the intense and reliable tumor uptake and the low off-target activity of OncoACP3-DOTA provide a strong rationale for future exploration in trials on PET imaging and radioligand therapy with beta- and alpha-particle emitters."

The aim of EMPIRE-2 was to explore the impact of RT dose escalation to sites of uptake on PET in comparison to EMPIRE-1. METHODS: EMPIRE-2 was a randomized trial of [(18)F]-fluciclovine versus [(68)Ga]-PSMA-11 in a cohort of men with biochemical progression after prostatectomy and negative conventional imaging findings. After stratification, patients were randomized to RT guided by [(18)F]-fluciclovine PET (arm 1) or [(68)Ga]-PSMA-11 PET (arm 2). PET findings were used for treatment decisions and for RT dose escalation (</=76.0 Gy to the prostate bed and </=56.0 Gy to the pelvis). The primary endpoint was 2-yr EFS in comparison to the [(18)F]-fluciclovine RT arm in EMPIRE-1. The secondary endpoint was a planned EFS comparison for [(18)F]-fluciclovine versus [(68)Ga]-PSMA-11 in EMPIRE-2. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: In the cohort of 140 patients, 59 randomized to arm 1 patients and 60 randomized to arm 2 completed RT. Median follow-up was 2.6 yr (interquartile range 1.8-4.0). The 2-yr EFS rates were 87% for the overall EMPIRE-2 cohort versus 80% for the EMPIRE-1 comparison cohort (difference 7.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.7-12%; p = 0.01). After propensity score weighting, the corresponding 2-yr EFS rates were 84% versus 73% (difference 11%, 95% CI 3.6-24%; p = 0.01). The 2-yr EFS rates in the EMPIRE-2 study arms were 87% for [(18)F]-fluciclovine versus 88% for [(68)Ga]-PSMA-11 (difference 0.7%, 95% CI 0.3-1.3%; p > 0.9). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Use of either [(18)F]-fluciclovine or [(68)Ga]-PSMA-11 imaging to guide RT dose escalation to sites of PET uptake in the prostate bed and/or pelvis was associated with an improvement in EFS in comparison to a prior trial without dose escalation."

The PROSA trial aimed to evaluate whether a contrast-free biparametric magnetic resonance imaging (bpMRI)-first screening strategy improves the detection of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) as the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes included overall PCa detection, benefit-harm metrics, and cost effectiveness from a health care payer perspective. METHODS: This single-center, randomized controlled trial enrolled 816 asymptomatic men aged 49-69 yr (>/=40 yr with a PCa family history). Participants were randomized into two arms: arm A underwent bpMRI regardless of the PSA levels; arm B received bpMRI only if PSA >/=3 ng/ml (or 2.5 ng/ml with a family history). Men with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score >/=3 were directed to a targeted biopsy. Imaging and pathology assessors were blinded; csPCa is defined as International Society of Urological Pathology grade group >/=2. The primary outcomes included csPCa detection, benefit-harm metrics, and cost effectiveness from a health care payer perspective. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Among 759 randomized men, biopsy and csPCa detection rates were higher in arm A (10.8% and 4.6%, respectively) than in arm B (5.2% and 1.8%, respectively), with a relative risk of 2.6 (95% confidence interval 1.1-6.1; p = 0.05) for the csPCa detection rate. Benefit-harm metrics favored the MRI-first strategy, showing higher grade selectivity (1.89 vs 1.75), biopsy efficiency (0.74 vs 0.54), and biopsy avoidance (23.1 vs 11.9). No serious adverse event was recorded. The MRI-first strategy yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro2201.75 per csPCa case detected. Limitations include single-round design and short follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In this randomized screening trial, a contrast-free MRI-first pathway improved csPCa detection, enhanced benefit-harm metrics, and showed favorable cost effectiveness."

We aimed to synthesise current evidence regarding their prognostic and predictive utility in urologic cancers. METHODS: In this prospectively registered systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD420251036536), we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science in April 2025 for studies evaluating the prognostic and predictive values of DP-AI models in patients with prostate (PCa), bladder (BCa), renal cell (RCC), testicular (TCa), or penile (PeCa) cancer. The risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool. Results were tabulated and summarised qualitatively. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Of the 1537 screened individual records, we included 31 studies validating DP-AI models in 21 155 patients. Nineteen studies were conducted in PCa (n = 17 541), six in BCa (n = 2349), five in RCC (n = 1176), and one in TCa (n = 89) patients. Ten PCa studies (n = 8951) utilised the ArteraAI model, including two (n = 2786) showing that it allows identification of patients treated with radiotherapy for clinically localised PCa that can safely omit short-term (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR] 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.19-0.63) or long-term (sHR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.41-0.73) androgen deprivation therapy. Two studies (n = 894) developed and validated a model allowing identification of patients with non-muscle-invasive BCa poorly responding to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (HR 2.3; 95% CI: 1.9-2.8), including one study (n = 253) validating a predictive biomarker for patients who may benefit from upfront gemcitabine/docetaxel. Many DP-AI models showed a prognostic association in localised PCa (n = 16 863), metastatic PCa (n = 678), non-muscle-invasive BCa (n = 2069), muscle-invasive BCa (n = 280), localised RCC (n = 1176), and germline TCa (n = 89) settings. None of the included studies assessed DP-AI models prospectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: DP-AI biomarkers hold promise to improve treatment personalisation through integration into clinical practice. Prospective validation is now required."

ENTRY is a cooperative partnership aimed at improving the training of urology residents. Metrics for TURBT were published after a Delphi consensus process involving experts. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and construct validity (via known-group and convergent validity) of objective metrics for characterizing the intraoperative performance of TUTBT as optimal versus suboptimal. METHODS: Thirty videos of TURBT performed by experts (n = 15) and novices (n = 15) were evaluated by three experienced urologists trained to reliably and independently score TURBT performance using the metrics previously developed. The videos were anonymized and the assessors were blinded to the surgeon, hospital, and expertise. The inter-rater reliability score was assessed and surgical errors were reported using a dummy dichotomous variable. A two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test was applied for between-group comparisons. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: The median number of overall errors was 1 (interquartile range [IQR] 0-2) in the expert group versus 5 (IQR 4-7) in the novice group, with a median difference of -4 errors (95% confidence interval [CI] -5 to -3; p = 0.001). The median number of noncritical errors per TURBT procedure was 1 (IQR 0-2) in the expert group versus 3 (IQR 2-4) in the novice group, with a median difference of -2 errors (95% CI -3 to -1; p = 0.001). The median number of critical errors was 0 (IQR 0-1) for the expert group versus 2 (IQR 2-3) for the novice group, with a median difference of -2 errors (95% CI -3 to -1; p = 0.001). We compared the performance of the expert and novice groups, which revealed a concordance index of 0.6 for noncritical errors, 0.73 for critical errors, and 0.66 for overall errors. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our study demonstrates the construct validity of metrics developed for the quality of TURBT performance. This represents a further step in establishing a quality-assured structured and standardized training program for TURBT."

METHODS: THERANOVA-LIM (NCT04931329) was a prospective, descriptive, single-centre study of cancer patients receiving oral treatment. Patients were divided into two groups: one group using the information card and the other using the standard prescription with QR code. Patient satisfaction was assessed at 3 months using questionnaires. RESULTS: In all, 128 patients were included: 55 received a 'drug information card' and 73 a 'prescription with QR code'. The median age was 69 (37-90). The three most common cancers were breast (37.5%), prostate (14.1%) and brain (10.9%). The vast majority of patients had metastatic cancer (90%). The three most prescribed drugs were capecitabine (21.1%), ribociclib (11.7%) and temozolomide (11.7%). Patients presented the QR codes during medical consultations (25.0%), pharmacy visits (100%) and during home visits by nurses (25.0%). Both patients and professionals were satisfied with these new systems. Pharmacists felt that the prescription with a QR code was more useful for their daily practice in the pharmacy (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: QR code systems proved effective in providing information to patients and healthcare professionals. The QR code prescription appeared to be the most practical for pharmacy activities.

We performed an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to assess the addition of docetaxel to RT and ADT in HRLPC. METHODS: IPD from patients with HRLPC (as defined by any of the following risk factors: Gleason score >/=8, prostate-specific antigen >20 ng/ml, cT3-T4, and/or N1) treated in trials evaluating RT + ADT +/- docetaxel, available in the Intermediate Clinical Endpoints in Carcinoma of the Prostate (ICECaP) repository, were collated. The primary outcome was metastasis-free survival (MFS), and the secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), and time to metastasis (TTM). Analyses were conducted using a one-stage IPD meta-analysis. Disease risk was defined as high (one risk factor) or very high (two to three risk factors and/or N1). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards and Fine-Gray competing risk models estimated the effect of addition of docetaxel to RT + ADT on each time-to-event outcome. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 1690 patients from four trials were included. Docetaxel did not lead to an overall benefit in MFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.89), OS (HR 0.88), and TTM (HR 0.87), but there was a significant benefit in EFS (HR 0.87) and PCSM (HR 0.70). The 5- and 10-yr MFS rates were, respectively, 79% and 57% in patients treated with RT + ADT, and 84% and 62% in those who received RT + ADT + docetaxel. There was no clear evidence of a greater benefit of docetaxel in patients with very-high-risk disease than in those with high-risk disease (MFS: HR 0.87 vs 0.97; OS: HR 0.86 vs 0.95; EFS: HR 0.83 vs 0.93; TTM: HR 0.86 vs 0.92; and PCSM: HR 0.70 vs 0.73), with no statistically significant difference in treatment effect by risk group (all p-interaction >0.1). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Addition of docetaxel to RT + ADT did not lead to a significant benefit in MFS or OS. Clinical stratification together with biomarkers should be evaluated to determine whether biologic features can identify HRLPC patients who are more likely to benefit from intensification of therapy with docetaxel."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recent Edinburgh-based research demonstrated high negative predictive value (NPV) for urinary dipstick testing for haematuria (UDH) in low-risk bladder cancer surveillance. This enabled a new protocol where flexible cystoscopy in surveillance years 2 and 4 is performed only if UDH is positive. Adopted across Scotland and included as aspirational in European Association of Urology guidelines, this protocol has yet to be validated in real-world settings. This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes of low-risk bladder cancer with the implementation of the new surveillance protocol. METHODS: The protocol began in December 2018. All patients with low-risk bladder cancer on initial transurethral resection of bladder tumour were included from January 2019 to February 2025. General practitioners conducted UDH in surveillance years 2 and 4; cystoscopy followed if positive. Patient and clinical data were prospectively recorded using a standardised institutional pro forma. This study performed the first clinical evaluation of the deintensified low-risk protocol. The study evaluated the recurrence and progression rates, NPV of UDH throughout surveillance, and number of check cystoscopies performed. The statistical analysis used Stata-BE version 19.0 for Mac. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 250 patients were observed with a recurrence rate of 14.4% and a progression rate of 1.6%, similar to preprotocol outcomes. The NPV of UDH remained above 94% throughout surveillance. Flexible cystoscopy use declined by 18.2%, saving at least  pound51 000. Limitations included a lack of randomisation, modest cohort sizes at 4 and 5 yr of surveillance, and absence of patient-reported outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The deintensified protocol appears safe, maintaining clinical outcomes whilst reducing procedural use and costs in low-risk bladder cancer."

Herein, we developed a GSH-responsive prodrug polymersome (PED@ICG) for copper-independent cuproptosis and synergistic photothermal therapy. Diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC) was covalently attached via disulfide bonds, ensuring a GSH-triggered release and intracellular GSH depletion. The amphiphilic polyprodrug formed stable polymersomes, and ICG coloading endowed imaging ability and NIR-activated photothermal heating. PED@ICG exhibited efficient cellular uptake through dynamin-mediated endocytosis, achieved deep tumor penetration, and selectively released DTC within the reductive tumor microenvironment. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated potent anticancer efficacy without the need for exogenous copper, while NIR irradiation further enhanced therapeutic outcomes through localized hyperthermia. This work offers a promising strategy for precise cuproptosis modulation and photothermal synergism, providing a clinically translatable nanoplatform for copper-independent tumor therapy."

RESULTS: Co-segregation analysis using a grid search across scaled penetrance levels for BRCA2 truncating variants yielded the strongest evidence in favour of pathogenicity, with LR maximised at approximately 20% of full penetrance (LR=11.026). Furthermore, estimated breast cancer risks were markedly higher for early onset breast cancer; women diagnosed at <50 years had a HR of 4.5, compared with a HR of 1.65 for women diagnosed at >/=50 years. The estimated lifetime risks were 25% for breast cancer and 6% for ovarian cancer.Evidence of pathogenicity was also supported by the presence of the variant allele in two patients with Fanconi anaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that BRCA2 c.8351G>A p.(Arg2784Gln) has a disease-causing effect, with reduced penetrance, similar to other pathogenic variants in moderate risk breast cancer genes such as ATM and CHEK2. We also provide risk-adapted recommendations for clinical management. Importantly, one should be aware of a reduced penetrance as the underlying reason for conflicting results among pieces of evidence used for variant classification."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cytotoxic drugs (cytostatics), widely used in the treatment of not only cancer diseases, are substances with potentially dangerous properties for healthcare personnel. Long-term daily exposure to cytostatics is associated with the possible manifestation of their genotoxic, carcinogenic and teratogenic effects. Handling of these drugs (during receipt, storage, preparation, packaging, transport, administration) can lead to contamination of the workplace and thus to exposure of healthcare personnel present. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our work was to propose, based on previous results and experience gained from long-term monitoring, a limit threshold value for surface contamination with cytotoxic drugs. METHODOLOGY: As part of the long-term monitoring (2008-2021) of surface contamination by cytostatics in pharmacies and hospitals in the Czech and Slovak Republics, the presence of eight drugs (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, methotrexate, irinotecan, paclitaxel, fluorouracil, gemcitabine and platinum as a representative of platinum cytostatics - oxaliplatin, carboplatin, cisplatin) was monitored. Samples were taken by employees of individual healthcare facilities and surface contamination was evaluated by the RECETOX Research Center of Masaryk University Brno using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. RESULTS: our study evaluated the surface contamination of cytostatics in 40 pharmacies (N = 1,277 samples) and 43 hospitals (N = 946 samples). Based on the results obtained and in accordance with currently known knowledge, we propose a threshold value of 100 pg/cm2 as the limit value of permissible contamination of cytostatics for most areas in pharmacies and hospitals (reception, storage, packaging, transport, application). On the one hand, contamination in isolator areas, where cytostatics are prepared in a controlled environment and using effective protective equipment and where their increased presence can therefore be \"expected\", should be perceived differently, and on the other hand, areas in administrative facilities and day rooms, where no protective equipment is used and contamination should therefore be zero. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the level of contamination in healthcare facilities working with cytotoxic drugs helps to set up work processes so that the working environment is safe for employees. Regular monitoring is an important tool. The proposal of a value of 100 pg/cm2 as an exposure hygiene limit represents the first step towards implementing mandatory monitoring into national legislation."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a common side effect in patients with breast cancer. Various non-pharmacological interventions are employed to alleviate CRF; however, current research lacks evaluations of their efficacy. This study compared the effectiveness of different non-pharmacological interventions on CRF in patients with breast cancer and to provide references for future research and clinical practice. METHODS: We systematically searched multiple databases, including the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (VIP), China Biology Medicine (CBM), PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and EMBASE, covering the period from the inception of each database to August 2024. The quality of the included studies was assessed via the AMSTAR-2 scale (a measurement tool to assess systematic reviews 2), and evidence mapping was used to summarise the characteristics of included studies. RESULTS: 52 systematic reviews/meta-analyses were included. The types of non-pharmacological interventions included 34 exercise interventions, 6 multidimensional interventions (a multimodal intervention approach involving three or more non-pharmacological therapies), 4 psychosocial interventions, 2 massage or acupuncture therapies, 2 art therapies, 1 moxibustion, 1 dietary supplement, 1 continuity of care and 1 systemic care. The conclusions of these studies were categorised as 'beneficial' for 41 studies, 'may be beneficial' for 9 studies and 'inconclusive' for 2 studies. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence mapping revealed that exercise interventions are the most widely used and effective interventions for CRF in patients with breast cancer. However, owing to the variety of non-pharmacological interventions and the fact that some of them are less common in studies, more large-sample, high-quality, prospective randomised trials and systematic reviews/meta-analyses involving different interventions are needed to further validate them in the future."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) suffer from symptoms related to both their disease and its treatment with marked variation between individuals with respect to symptom expression. This study aimed to determine whether genetic variation in cytokine expression is associated with symptom severity. METHODS: An exploratory prospective, longitudinal consecutive patient cohort study was undertaken across two Queensland sites. Patient characteristics including tumour burden and current treatment were collected at baseline. Symptom severity was assessed 3-4 weekly for up to 6 assessments, with blood taken for genetic analysis once only during the study. Cytokine gene variants of each participant were assessed using a panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) most described in the literature. RESULTS: Of the 66 participants, 27/66 (41%) had a low, and 39/66 (59%) a high tumour burden. Symptom severity was not related to tumour burden or patient characteristics. Of the 142 SNPs analysed from 62 participants, 15 SNPs from 7 genes were significantly associated with symptom severity. After Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment, SNPs rs2069772 from Interleukin-2 (IL2) and rs230494 from Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFKb) remained significant. CONCLUSION: Although multiple factors can influence symptom severity, genetic variation may play a part. The early identification of men likely to develop severe symptoms during the course of their prostate cancer could theoretically enable symptoms to be managed more aggressively from an early stage. These preliminary findings need to be replicated in a larger cohort of men with CRPC."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the factors for increasing sedentary time during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in older patients with locally advanced oesophageal cancer (LAEC) and to elucidate potential clinical mechanisms. METHODS: We conducted a single-centre exploratory prospective cohort study. Between October 2021 and December 2023, consecutive 80 patients with LAEC aged >/=65 years were scheduled for curative oesophagectomy after NAC. The change in sedentary time (Delta=after NAC - before NAC; expressed in min/week) was calculated from sedentary time measured by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. Factors associated with the change in sedentary time were investigated using a multivariate regression model. Two-tailed statistical significance was accepted at p<0.05. RESULTS: A total of 69 patients were included in the analysis. The mean age was 72.9 years, and docetaxel+cisplatin + fluorouracil, cisplatin+fluorouracil and oxaliplatin+leucovorin + fluorouracil regimens were administered to 46 (67%), 4 (6%) and 19 (27%) patients, respectively. The mean sedentary times before and after chemotherapy were 3235+/-1477 min/week and 3557+/-1598 min/week, and the mean change in sedentary time during chemotherapy was 322+/-736 min/week. Worsening fatigue was a significant factor influencing increased sedentary time during chemotherapy (vs non-worsening fatigue, adjusted coefficient 531.111, 95% CI 104.960 to 957.261, p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical mechanism of increasing sedentary time during chemotherapy may be associated with worsening fatigue. In older adults with LAEC, a physical activity intervention during NAC may improve clinical outcomes."

    "abstract": "Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) of patients with differentiated metastatic thyroid cancer has been standard treatment for more than 80 y. A high and uniform expression of the NaI symporter in malignant thyroid cells results in tumoricidal absorbed doses (ADs) delivered by the beta-particle emissions of the radioactive iodine ((131)I). Treatment is less effective for patients whose disease exhibits reduced or variable expression of NaI symporter. Methods: We have investigated a treatment strategy that combines radioiodine with external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for patients with low (131)I uptake. By combining the AD delivered by the RPT agent with that delivered by EBRT, we achieve the targeted tumoricidal AD (80 Gy 2-Gy equieffective dose) while maintaining safe normal-organ AD. A tracer administration of RPT is used to calculate a patient-specific administered activity (AA) for therapy that yields organ-at-risk ADs below toxicity thresholds. The tumor and relevant organ-at-risk ADs from the therapeutic administration are calculated and provided to the radiation oncology medical physicists for combination therapy planning. We illustrate this precision-medicine approach to treating thyroid cancer patients using data from the first 5 patients in our ongoing clinical trial. Results: A precision-medicine approach gave an AA ranging from 14.3 to 19.5 GBq. Combined RPT-EBRT therapy of the selected lesions yielded doses ranging from 73 to 147 Gy. Conclusion: We have demonstrated the feasibility of combined RPT-EBRT in thyroid cancer patients with reduced radioiodine uptake when a standard AA of 5.55 GBq (150 mCi) would have delivered a much lower AD to lesions, less likely to lead to a response. There is considerable patient variability in clearance kinetics. Clinical benefit assessment in adjusting AA on the basis of a precision methodology would require a multicenter trial."

    "abstract": "Cells navigate within diverse curved microenvironments derived from extracellular matrix (ECM) and neighboring cells in vivo. While current studies primarily focus on cell migration on curved surfaces, cellular adaptive responses to confinement-coupled geometric curvature remain largely unexplored. Herein, we design a confined curvature-based microfluidic chip (CCM-Chip) that mimics the physiologically relevant physical cues encountered during cell migration and investigate how cells dynamically answer to local geometric features. In the CCM-Chip, cells exhibit shape bending, nuclear deformation, and cytoskeletal remodeling that correlate with local geometric curvature. We then engineer a microgrooved uniaxial stretching microdevice to manipulate cell shape and find that curvature-induced cell shape results in nuclear envelope stretching, thus initiating downstream nuclear responses. Significantly, the stretched nuclear envelope effectively triggers the recruitment of cPLA2 to the nucleus, with nesprin and SUN1 serving as critical mediators in the process of nuclear mechanotransduction. The cPLA2 activation promotes stress fiber polarization at the cell front and enhances cellular contractility, facilitating curvature-induced cell migration. This work provides a versatile biomimetic microdevice for cell migration studies and highlights the key role of nuclear deformation-induced cPLA2 signaling in adaptive cell migration, advancing the development of therapeutic strategies against cancer metastasis."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Western diet and associated production of secondary bile acids (BAs) have been linked to the development of sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC). Despite observational studies showing that secondary BAs produced by 7alpha-dehydroxylating (7alphaDH+) gut bacteria are increased in CRC, a causal proof of their tumour-promoting effects is lacking. OBJECTIVE: Investigate the causal role of BAs produced by 7alphaDH+ gut bacteria in CRC. DESIGN: We performed feeding studies in a porcine model of CRC combined with multi-omics analyses and gnotobiotic mouse models colonised with 7alphaDH+ bacteria or a genetically modified strain to demonstrate causality. RESULTS: Western diet exacerbated the CRC phenotype in APC (1311/+) pigs. This was accompanied by increased levels of the secondary BA deoxycholic acid (DCA) and higher colonic epithelial cell proliferation. The latter was counteracted by the BA-scavenging drug colestyramine. Metagenomic analysis across multiple human cohorts revealed higher occurrence of bai (BA inducible) operons from Clostridium scindens and close relatives in faeces of patients with CRC. Addition of these specific 7alphaDH+ bacteria (C. scindens/Extibacter muris) to defined communities of gut bacteria led to DCA production and increased colon tumour burden in mouse models of chemically or genetically induced CRC. A mutant strain of Faecalicatena contorta lacking 7alphaDH caused fewer colonic tumours in azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate treated mice and triggered less epithelial cell proliferation in human colon organoids compared with wild-type F. contorta. CONCLUSION: This work provides functional evidence for the causal role of secondary BAs produced by gut bacteria through 7alphaDH in CRC under adverse dietary conditions, opening avenues for future preventive strategies."

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study SETTING: The study was carried out in six subdistricts, located in hard-to-reach and climate-impacted regions of Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 8000 married women aged 30-60 years were invited for screening. Women who were unable to give consent, were pregnant or had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix, previous screening less than 5 years, or treatment of the cervix or had symptoms of potential cervical cancer were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: A community-based hrHPV self-collected screening for cervical cancer was conducted from June 2022 to July 2023. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of cervical hrHPV and risk factor association. RESULTS: 11 127 women were eligible for screening; 7850 women submitted hrHPV self-swabs, 7828 valid HPV test results were reported and 164 women (2.1%) tested hrHPV positive. Women living in the North were 2.1 times more likely to be hrHPV positive compared with women living in the South (adjusted OR (AOR)=2.1, 95% CI: 1.5 to 3.8, p=0.023) and widowed women were 3.0 times more likely to be hrHPV positive than married women (AOR=3.0, 95% CI: 1.7 to 5.3, p=0.001). Another risk factor associated with testing hrHPV positive was the use of hormonal contraceptives for 5 years and above (AOR=7.0, 95% CI: 2.0 to 24.4, p=0.002). CONCLUSION: The study identified a low overall prevalence of hrHPV infection (2.1%) among women in hard-to-reach areas in Bangladesh, with some regional variations. Higher prevalence was observed in widowed compared with married women and among women reporting more than 5 years of hormonal contraceptive use. This study shows no evidence of particularly high-risk groups in hard-to-reach areas in Bangladesh. The findings support the feasibility of implementing a nationwide hr-HPV-based self-sampling strategy as a viable approach to reach WHO targets for reducing the burden of cervical cancer. Recommendation for policymakers to support future research to identify hrHPV prevalence among women in comparable groups in other geographically remote areas in Bangladesh.

DESIGN: We conducted a hospital-based retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The study was conducted at Hawassa and Wolaita Sodo University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 492 women with BC diagnosed from January 2020 to December 2022 were enrolled. Follow-up extended from the date of diagnosis until the occurrence of an event (death), loss to follow-up or the study end date. OUTCOME MEASURES: Data were collected using a structured data collection tool through medical record review and exported to Stata V.16 for analysis. Unweighted and weighted Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to estimate death-free survival time. Inverse-probability-weighted regression adjustment was employed to estimate the association of NLR with time to death. At a statistical significance level of p<0.05, regression coefficients with 95% CIs were reported. RESULTS: The incidence of mortality in patients with BC with a higher NLR was 4.2 (95% CI 3.3 to 5.2) per 100 person-month observation (PMO); it was 1.9 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.4) per 100 PMO for those with a low NLR. When everyone in the population of interest has a low NLR, the average time to death is estimated as 17.2 (95% CI 11.4 to 23.0) months. For women with a higher NLR, the average time to death is estimated as 10.8 (95% CI 8.93 to 12.8) months. For women with a higher NLR, the average time to death was shorter by 6.3 months (coefficient: -6.3, 95% CI -12.5 to -0.082). Furthermore, the effectiveness of exposure to high NLR (ratio of average treatment effect to low NLR potential outcome means) was a 36.7% (95% CI 12% to 61%) reduction in mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: A high NLR was associated with significantly higher mortality in BC patients, independent of baseline clinicopathological variables. Patients with elevated NLR more often presented with advanced stage disease and distant metastases. These findings indicate that NLR, a simple and accessible biomarker, may help to identify patients at increased risk of poor prognosis."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sexual concerns are a key unmet need among patients with cancer. Women are less likely than men to be assessed for sexual concerns, due in part to a lack of appropriate screening tools. The Self-Efficacy to Communicate about Sex and Intimacy (SECSI) scale measures perceived ability to communicate about sex and intimacy during cancer yet has not been evaluated among patients undergoing active treatment. OBJECTIVES: This study describes sexual, emotional, and interpersonal well-being of partnered women undergoing chemotherapy and evaluates the psychometrics of the SECSI in this sample. METHODS: Participants (N = 149) completed measures of mental health, sexual health, and relationship satisfaction. RESULTS: Almost 60% of participants reported engaging in sexual activity in the last month. Participants reported feeling most bothered by low sexual interest. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated a single-factor structure was insufficient for the SECSI while exploratory factor analysis extracted one factor. Convergent and discriminant validity of the SECSI were also supported by this study's findings. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates women undergoing chemotherapy are both engaged in sexual activity, yet bothered by decreased interest, and provides further support for the use of the SECSI in a group of women currently in chemotherapy."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Many patients with breast cancer (BC) experience reproductive concerns that contribute to psychosocial distress. Although many patients experience elevated levels of distress, few pursue psychosocial support (PSS) to manage their distress. We characterized the associations between BC patients' PSS utilization and demoralization, hopelessness, anxiety, depression, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and previous experiences with psychosocial providers. METHODS: One hundred and four BC patients with reproductive concerns were recruited. Bivariate correlations assessed the relationships between measures of psychosocial distress and health care utilization. Independent logistic regressions were run to evaluate the unique associations between predictors of interest and PSS utilization. RESULTS: Most participants (57.7%) reported utilizing PSS during treatment. Higher levels of demoralization (OR = 1.109, p = 0.004) and HRQOL (OR = 0.964, p = 0.010) were significantly associated with increased odds of PSS utilization. Prior satisfaction with mental healthcare practitioners was also significantly associated with psychosocial utilization (OR = 0.561, p = 0.018). Anxiety, depression, and hopelessness were not significantly associated with PSS utilization. CONCLUSIONS: These data underscore the role of demoralization, HRQOL, and prior mental health care experiences in BC patient's PSS utilization. Many distress screening tools assess patients for the presence of depression and anxiety, but do not assess for demoralization. Thus, incorporating demoralization into screening tools may better identify and engage BC patients with reproductive concerns in PSS services."

    "abstract": "CD47 plays an important role in immune evasion through suppressing macrophage phagocytosis. CD47 blockade has been widely explored in immunotherapy of cancers through enhancing macrophage phagocytosis. However, the role of CD47 in lung cancer cell apoptosis and ferroptosis is not well defined. In this study, we found that CD47 was highly expressed and ferroportin (FPN) was low expressed in lung cancer cells. Over-expression of CD47 increased the expression of Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2); but suppressed the expression of FPN. Knock-down and blockade of CD47 expression and activity suppressed the expression of Nrf2 and enhanced the expression of FPN, subsequently improved lung cancer cell ferroptosis, accompanied with increased expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hemosiderin deposition. Suppression of Nrf2 activity by Brusatol increased FPN expression at a concentration-dependent manner; whereas over-expression of FPN increased lung cancer cell ferroptosis. More studies in mouse model showed that knockdown of CD47 effectively attenuated lung cancer cell growth after subcutaneous inoculation of shCD47-pretreated LLC cells, associated with increased infiltration of neutrophils, CD8+ T cells and Malondialdehyde (MDA) products. Meanwhile, the expressions of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta were elevated in the treated tumor tissues. IL-6 and TNF-alpha suppressed the expression of CD47, but increased the expression of FPN, accompanied with elevated expression of Bax, Cleaved caspase-3, NCOA4 (Nuclear receptor coactivator 4). Therefore, blockade of CD47 expression attenuated lung cancer growth through suppressing Nrf2 and subsequently increasing the expression of FPN. CD47 exerts immune evasion via Nrf2/FPN axis."

Here, we found that ovarian cancer tissues had higher C/EBPbeta expression compared with normal tissues and high C/EBPbeta expression predicted unfavorable survival outcomes. Elevated C/EBPbeta expression enhanced cisplatin resistance and olaparib resistance. C/EBPbeta could affect DDR signals of ovarian cancer. CDK12, serving as a C/EBPbeta-regulated DDR-related gene, was directly targeted by and bound with C/EBPbeta. C/EBPbeta could promote CDK12 expression and confer drug tolerance via CDK12. Manipulation of CDK12 could reverse the effects of C/EBPbeta. Using CDK12 inhibitor THZ531 could rescue C/EBPbeta-mediated cisplatin resistance and olaparib resistance. Our findings indicated that C/EBPbeta is a potent DDR regulator of ovarian cancer, which directly targets CDK12 and upregulates its expression. High C/EBPbeta expression mediates platinum resistance and PARP inhibitor resistance via CDK12. Targeting C/EBPbeta via CDK12 inhibition could rescue drug responsiveness of ovarian cancer, thereby counteracting platinum and PARP inhibitor resistance. C/EBPbeta could thus be exploited as a candidate prognostic biomarker in ovarian cancer."

This study characterized the carcinogenic potential of single or combined dietary exposure to Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP, a PAH) and a mixture of six food-derived NOCs in the A/J Min/+ mouse model for human colorectal cancer. Mice were given diets containing low or high concentrations of BaP and/or NOCs for nine weeks. The concentrations were based on estimated daily intake levels in the European population. A sex-dependent increased CRC initiation was detected after combined exposure to the high doses of BaP and NOCs. No effects were seen on CRC following exposure to the low doses of BaP or NOCs individually or in combination. Targeted plasma metabolomics revealed alterations in cellular membranes, lipid and energy metabolism in mice exposed to the high doses of BaP and NOCs. An alteration of plasma metabolites was also seen in mice exposed to the low dose of BaP, but not in mice exposed to the low dose of NOCs or to the combined low doses of BaP and NOCs. The study highlights the complex interplay between dietary carcinogens."

    "abstract": "Breast cancer remains a major global health challenge, with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) posing a particular therapeutic dilemma due to its lack of targetable receptors and reliance on chemotherapy, which is often thwarted by drug resistance. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel metal-polyphenol nano-platform (DLF@NPs) via a one-pot coordination assembly of L-dopa (L-DA), doxorubicin (DOX), and ferrous ions (Fe(2+)). This GSH/pH-dual-responsive nanoparticle exploits the overexpression of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) on breast cancer cells for targeted delivery and tumor-specific enrichment, effectively addressing the off-target toxicity and resistance associated with free DOX. Upon internalization into the acidic and high-GSH tumor microenvironment, DLF@NPs rapidly disassemble, releasing their payload. The liberated DOX not only exerts its apoptotic effect but also activates NADPH oxidases (NOXs) to elevate intracellular H(2)O(2) levels. This endogenous H(2)O(2) supply fuels a Fenton reaction catalyzed by the co-released Fe(2+), generating highly toxic hydroxyl radicals. Furthermore, L-DA reduces the resultant Fe(3+) back to Fe(2+), establishing a catalytic cycle that robustly amplifies reactive oxygen species (ROS). The resultant ROS burst synergizes with DOX by inducing severe mitochondrial damage, leading to potentiated apoptosis. In summary, this work proposes a novel targeted nanoplatform that utilizes the synergy between chemodynamic therapy and chemotherapy to provide a promising strategy for combating drug-resistant breast cancer."

Solute carrier family 38 member 5 (SLC38A5) emerges as a promising target due to its pharmacological tractability and role in cancer progression. In this study, we demonstrate that SLC38A5 promoted CRC progression through both bioinformatic analysis and experimental validation. Knockdown of SLC38A5 significantly suppressed cell viability, colony formation, and migratory ability in DLD1 and HCT116 cells. Notably, SLC38A5 depletion sensitized CRC cells to RSL3-induced ferroptosis. Mechanistically, SLC38A5 inhibition down-regulated antioxidant-related genes Nrf2 and Heme Oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and key ferroptosis regulators GPX4 and SLC7A11, while modulating Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long-Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) and Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 (SCD1) expression. Additionally, SLC38A5 knockdown impaired nuclear translocation of YAP, the core transcriptional co-activator in the Hippo signaling pathway. ‌Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis demonstrated the binding of YAP to Nrf2. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism wherein SLC38A5 confers ferroptosis resistance in CRC via YAP nuclear translocation within the Hippo signaling pathway. Collectively, this study highlights SLC38A5 as a potential therapeutic target to enhance ferroptosis-based cancer therapy, offering new strategies to improve CRC treatment outcomes."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of patient and area-level sociodemographic factors associated with the use of GC testing for localized PCa. Although genomic classifiers (GC) can improve stratification of prostate cancer (PCa) risk and facilitate personalization of treatment decision making, the factors influencing a patient's use of GCs remains poorly characterized. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study to identify patients who were diagnosed with localized PCa from 2012-2022 and received genomic testing. We compiled clinical, area deprivation index (ADI), and health insurance information. The primary study outcome was receipt of the GC assay from biopsy. Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between ADI and receipt of a GC test. RESULTS: Among 2,103 eligible patients, 40.1% underwent genomic testing, and of those, 97.5% had available ADI information. A higher proportion of patients in the least deprived areas received genomic testing (40.9%) compared to those in the most deprived areas (34.6%) (p<0.001). When adjusting for clinical and pathologic factors, age at time of biopsy, Hispanic ethnicity, and residence in a more deprived area were associated with lower odds of receiving a GC test. Among tested patients, ADI was not significantly associated with GC risk (all p-values >0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Use of genomic testing was lower in patients living in areas with higher levels of social disadvantage, as well as patients of Hispanic ethnicity. These findings highlight potential sources of disparity in the use of discretionary risk assessment tools for PCa."

We explored germline alteration prevalence in predisposition genes across lung cancer histologies from two large populations. METHODS: Germline sequencing of 11,740 primary lung cancers was performed with Tempus xT tumor-normal matched assay (DNAseq of 648 genes at average 500x coverage, normal specimens at 150x coverage, full transcriptome RNA-seq). Pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) potential germline alterations in 46 genes were compared between smokers and never smokers; never smokers somatic EGFR altered (sEGFRalt) and wild-type (sEGFRwt); non-small cell (NSCLC) and small cell (SCLC) histologies; and NSCLC sEGFRalt and NSCLC sEGFRwt. P/LP variants were investigated in these 46 genes in 1,330 patients with lung cancer from the UK BioBank by smoking status. FINDINGS: Tempus sequencing revealed P/LP alterations in 4.8% of smokers and 5.8% of never smokers, with most alterations in MUTYH (1.3% vs. 1.1%), ATM (0.7% vs. 1.0%), BRCA2 (0.6% vs. 0.9%) and EGFR (< 0.1% vs. 0.4%). Never-smoker sEGFRalt (n=549) and sEGFRwt (n=1025) tumors had alterations in MUTYH (1.1% vs. 1.1%), ATM (0.7% vs. 1.1%), and EGFR (1.1% vs. 0%). NSCLC and SCLC tumors had alterations in MUTYH (1.3% vs. 0.3%), ATM (0.8% vs. 0.3%), and BRCA2 (0.7% vs. 0%). sEGFRalt and sEGFRwt NSCLC tumors had germline alterations in MUTYH (1.6% vs 1.3%), ATM (0.5% vs. 0.8%), EGFR (1.3% vs. 0%), and BRCA2 (0.8% vs. 0.6%). UK Biobank patients had similar P/LP alterations: 4.3% of smokers and 5.1% of never-smokers, with most germline alterations in ATM (0.8%), BRCA2 (0.79%) and MUTYH (0.62%) in smokers and MUTYH (1.5%) and CHEK2 (1.01%) in never-smokers. INTERPRETATION: Similar distribution of P/LP potential germline alterations in lung cancer subtypes from distinct populations by smoking status suggests increased next-generation germline sequencing may improve risk assessment."

    "abstract": "BRAF V600E mutation (BRAFm) is present in around 8% of metastatic colorectal cancers (mCRC) and is associated with a poor prognosis. The encorafenib-cetuximab combination (ENCO-CET) is currently the standard second-line treatment of BRAFm mCRC. However, 2-5% of patients treated with cetuximab experience grade 3-4 infusion-related reactions (IRRs), leading to treatment discontinuation. In addition, BRAF inhibitors must be combined with an anti-EGFR to have any efficacy in BRAFm mCRCCitation. As panitumumab (PANI) is associated with a lower risk of IRRs, this study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of ENCO-PANI as an alternative strategy in patients experiencing an IRR to CET. We retrospectively collected BRAFm mCRC patients that switched ENCO-CET for ENCO-PANI following an IRR to CET. Twenty pts were identified across 12 centers from 4 countries. Most were male (12/20), 11/20 had right-sided primary tumor and 5/20 pts were dMMR/MSI. Median age was 66, treatment line was 2(nd) line in 85% and 3(rd) line in 15% of patients; 19 patients started ENCO-CET and switched to ENCO-PANI (cycle 2 or 3) and 1 received ENCO-PANI upfront due to patient's choice. Response rate was 25% and disease control rate 85%. Median progression-free survival was 6.2 and median overall survival 11 months. Adverse events (AEs) during ENCO-PANI occurred in 15/20, mostly G1-G2. No new IRRs nor toxic deaths were reported. ENCO-PANI appears to be as safe and effective in pts treated for a BRAFm mCRC unable to continue CET and may represent a valid alternative therapeutic option in this setting."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates remain limited, and effective methods for offering the choice of colonoscopy or stool testing through outreach have not been identified. We evaluate the effect of sequential choice compared to colonoscopy outreach on screening completion, and further evaluate behavioral nudges in the electronic health record (EHR). METHODS: In this pragmatic randomized clinical trial, patients were randomly allocated in a 1:2:2 ratio to 1) usual care (no outreach), 2) colonoscopy only, or 3) sequential choice of colonoscopy, then fecal immunochemical testing (FIT). Patients in arms 2 and 3 were additionally randomized to receive either (a) usual care, or (b) a visit-based, clinician-directed nudge facilitated by the EHR with follow-up texting to the patient. The primary outcome is CRC screening completion within 3 years by either colonoscopy, 2 negative fecal immunochemical tests (FIT), or 1 positive FIT followed by colonoscopy within one year. ANALYSIS: For the patient-directed analysis, the primary outcome will be evaluated by comparing CRC screening completion among patients randomized to either outreach arm (2 or 3) to the no outreach arm (1). We will also compare completion between the colonoscopy only arm (1) and the sequential choice arm (2). For the visit-based analysis, we will compare CRC screening completion among patients between the usual care arms (2a and 3a) and the nudge arms (2b and 3b). CONCLUSION: This trial is unique in evaluating the long-term effectiveness of offering sequential choice to colonoscopy alone through a multi-level, centralized outreach and visit-based design.

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common and intolerable adverse effect of oxaliplatin and paclitaxel. The intolerance to CIPN symptoms often leads to poor compliance and treatment discontinuation, jeopardizing survival outcomes. However, no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved interventions exist for preventing or treating CIPN. A major challenge has been that neuroprotective candidates often diminish the effectiveness of chemotherapy, limiting their translational development. Here, we aimed to identify neuroprotective agents that maintain anticancer activity. Using ND7/23 dorsal root ganglion neurons treated with oxaliplatin and paclitaxel, we screened our compound library and identified formononetin, a natural isoflavone, as a promising candidate. Formononetin significantly protected ND7/23 DRG neurons against oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity by reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis via activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) antioxidant pathway and modulating protein expressions of pro-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X (Bax) and anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2). Formononetin showed limited protection against paclitaxel-induced structural neurite damage. Importantly, unlike the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which decreased the anticancer effectiveness of both oxaliplatin and paclitaxel, formononetin maintained their anticancer effects in colorectal cancer HT29 cells and cervical cancer SiHa cells. Taken together, formononetin holds potential as a neuroprotectant to prevent oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity without compromising anticancer efficacy."

Recent initiatives by the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) and the Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS) have produced key consensus updates aimed at refining diagnostic criteria and resolving long-standing controversies. This review highlights high-impact developments in bladder and prostate pathology, including updated grading systems and T1 substaging in bladder tumors, the proposed hybrid grading approach, and the classification of urachal carcinoma. Evolving perspectives in prostate pathology are also discussed, encompassing intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P), neuroendocrine and aggressive variant tumors, and the clinical relevance of Grade Group 1 disease in the context of active surveillance. Recent literature and consensus statements are summarized with attention to diagnostic challenges and practical implementation. These focused updates highlight the dynamic nature of urologic pathology and reflect a broader movement toward greater diagnostic precision, reproducibility, and clinical relevance, with adoption of ISUP and GUPS frameworks essential for improving patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma is often very challenging to diagnose due to high false negative biopsy rates. There are known precursors to cholangiocarcinoma such as primary sclerosing cholangitis and hepatitis; however, identifying early and sensitive biomarkers for liver injury and tumor progression could enhance cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and management. Recent studies have suggested blood and bile-based microRNA (miRNA) panels performed better than existing tumor markers. To further investigate this, we conducted next-generation sequencing of thioacetamide (TAA) induced cholangiocarcinoma in an established rat model. We identified 2938 unique differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 27 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) between tumor bearing rats and normal controls. Pathway analyses on the DEGs and DEMs revealed the molecular mechanisms of hepatic hyperplasia and nephritis. To filter for ideal biomarkers, we further performed qPCR on bile and serum. Three miRNAs (miR-146b-5p, miR-223-3p and miR-214-3p) overlapped with the DEMs from solid tumors. Therefore, those miRNAs have the potential to serve as early and sensitive biomarkers for TAA-induced cholangiocarcinoma. Notably, no previous study has demonstrated the role of miR-146-5p on cancer development."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study reports the long-term outcomes of simultaneous integrated boost radiotherapy (SIB-RT) combined with oral S-1 chemotherapy (CRTCT) in inoperable patients aged >/= 70 years with inoperable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: In this multicenter, phase III randomized trial, patients with inoperable, locally advanced stage II-IV ESCC were randomized to receive either CRTCT or RT alone. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), restricted mean survival time (RMST), and patterns of failure. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 75 months, patients in the CRTCT group had longer OS than those in the RT group (hazard ratio (HR), 0.74; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.57-0.95; P = 0.02), with better 5-year OS rates (34.1 % vs. 23.6 %,P = 0.02), PFS (31.1 % vs. 20.9 %,P = 0.02), and RMST (33.0 vs. 27.0 months,P = 0.02). CRTCT's effect on OS stabilized over 5 years. Locoregional failure was lower in the CRTCT group (HR, 0.64; 95 % CI, 0.45-0.92; P = 0.02), with similar distant and mixed failure risks. CONCLUSIONS: SIB-RT combined with oral S-1 chemotherapy significantly improved long-term survival and therefore might be considered a standard of care for elderly patients with inoperable ESCC.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Precise delineation of genitourinary structures during prostate cancer (PCa) care is critical to optimize treatment delivery while minimizing toxicity and injury. The Prostate and UREthra on MRI (PURE-MRI) study is an international, prospective study to assess physicians' accuracy segmenting prostate and urethra on MRI. METHODS: Physicians who diagnose or treat PCa were invited to contour prostate and urethra on patient cases using standard T(2)-weighted MRI (all planes). We compared these contours to reference consensus segmentations produced by a multidisciplinary panel of experts. We also evaluated performance of validated auto-segmentation AI tools. Accuracy was assessed with spatial and volumetric analyses. A mixed effects model was used to evaluate potential factors influencing contour performance. RESULTS: 62 specialists from 11 countries created 114 prostate and 110 urethra contours. Prostate median (min, max) accuracy for physicians [vs. AI] was Dice: 0.92 (0.62, 0.95) [vs. 0.95 (0.94, 0.96)], maximum deviation inside prostate: 3.4 mm (1.0, 12.4) [vs. 3.0 mm (3.0, 3.0)], maximum deviation beyond prostate: 5.3 mm (2.4, 17.3) [vs. 3.9 mm (3.1, 4.9)], mean deviation (per case) from the reference prostate: 1.6 mm (0.9, 3.9) [vs. 1.2 mm (1.1, 1.6)]. Urethra accuracy was Dice: 0.33 (0.03, 0.69) [vs. 0.41 (0.35, 0.48)], coverage: 36 % (3 %, 96 %) [vs. 81 % (80 %, 91 %)], maximum (2D) deviation beyond urethra: 1.6 mm (1.0, 2.3) [vs. 1.8 mm (1.3, 2.1)]. CONCLUSION: Physicians contour the prostate on MRI with overall Dice >0.9, though typical cases still include at least one error >5 mm and sometimes >10 mm. Physician urethra contours were less accurate, with typical coverage of <40 % of the reference urethra (compared to >80 % for AI). Physician trainees performed similarly to experienced clinicians. AI tools give comparable accuracy to practicing physicians for prostate contours and achieve better coverage of the urethra."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) is part of the human skin virome. Like other HPyVs, it encodes proteins with oncogenic properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 73-year-old Italian female patient with stage II right-sided colon adenocarcinoma underwent hemicolectomy; she died one month later because of bacterial sepsis. Colon tumor (T), adjacent healthy (AH) tissue, and serum samples were collected. Total nucleic acids were subjected to next-generation sequencing, followed by metagenomics analysis. HPyV detection was confirmed by real-time PCR and Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA); HPyV6 transcripts and proteins were identified by means of PCR and Western blot/mass spectrometry, respectively. RESULTS: Viral metagenomics analysis revealed the presence of several viral genomes, mainly belonging to unclassified viruses and phages, in both AH and T tissues. HPyV6 DNA was detected in the T tissue, representing 7 % of the viral sequences, but not in the AH tissue. Subsequent molecular analysis confirmed the presence of the HPyV6 genomes (3.3x10(6)copies/ug) as episomes, infecting 19.8 % of the tumor cells; LT-Ag and VP1 transcripts were expressed in the T tissue, and the LT-Ag protein was expressed twice as highly in the T tissue as in the AH tissue. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the differential presence and expression of the HPyV6 genome in colon tumors but not in the AH tissue. These results are indicative of ongoing active replication of the virus, which might play a triggering role in malignant transformation."

Among the tested weight ratios, 75:25 micelles exhibited optimal properties, including average particle sizes below 200 nm, a narrow size distribution (PDI < 0.2), high drug loading (8-8.7 %), and encapsulation efficiency > 90 %. The optimized formulations (FVT-MM and FVT-QUE-MM) showed spherical morphology, stability over 15 days, and sustained FVT release without an initial burst. In vitro, these formulations preserved the antiproliferative activity of FVT against MCF-7 cells after 72 h of treatment and maintained high cytocompatibility in Caco-2 cells (>90 %). Ex vivo Franz diffusion studies with porcine intestine revealed enhanced FVT permeation for FVT-QUE-MM ( approximately 1.8-fold vs. FVT-MM). Both formulations also inhibited MCF-7 cell adhesion to fibronectin and migration, with stronger effects observed for FVT-QUE-MM. Oral pharmacokinetic studies in rats demonstrated significantly increased relative FVT bioavailability for FVT-MM (2.85- fold) and FVT-QUE-MM (3.71-fold) compared to FVT suspension. These findings suggest that Soluplus(R)/Pluronic(R) F127 micelles, particularly those co-loaded with QUE, represent a promising strategy to improve the oral delivery and therapeutic efficacy of FVT."

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a degradative process for recycling and breaking down cellular components, with several context-dependent functions in the development of tumors and resistance to therapy. Numerous clinical trials aiming to target autophagy in different tumors have been initiated as indicated by encouraging results from diverse preclinical investigations. Research on the connection between autophagosomes and the prognosis of different malignancies is now underway. The autophagy machinery itself may serve as a source of biomarkers for this purpose. Numerous research studies have established the association between autophagy-related genes (ATGs) and proteins (Atgs) in diverse types of cancer. Nonetheless, the outcomes of this association are still uncertain and the validation of reliable autophagy-related biomarkers is still lagging behind, owing to the paradoxical roles of autophagy in tumor biology and the scarcity of primary research studies. Herein, we explore recent developments, issues, and trends in the evaluation of clinically significant ATGs' and their encoded proteins' biomarker potential in human malignancies."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Accurate polyp measurement is vital for colorectal cancer treatment and surveillance. Traditional methods are often unreliable. The FDA-approved Virtual Scale Endoscopy (VSE) provides real-time, laser-calibrated overlays to improve size measurements. This meta-analysis evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of VSE compared with conventional methods: visual assessment (VA), snare, and biopsy forceps. METHODS: We conducted a pairwise meta-analysis comparing VSE and VA, along with a frequent network meta-analysis (NMA) assessing VSE, VA, snare, and forceps retrieved from PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Embase, WPRIM, and Scopus until January 2025. Risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) were computed with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). SUCRA analysis ranked interventions. PROSPERO ID: CRD420251024644 RESULTS: Eleven studies were included, comprising 1,581 polyps across six clinical and five pre-clinical studies. In pairwise analysis, VSE significantly improved measurement accuracy compared to VA (MD 14.52%; 95% CI [10.35-18.70]) and reduced total misclassifications (54.3% vs 73.6%; RR 0.64; 95% CI [0.42-0.97]). In clinical subgroups, VSE markedly reduced overestimation rates (22.5% vs 41.5%; RR 0.52; 95% CI [0.44-0.63]). NMA confirmed VSE as the top-ranked modality for minimizing total misclassification (SUCRA 100%), outperforming snare, forceps, and VA. No overall differences were detected in total over- or underestimation. CONCLUSIONS: VSE significantly improves polyp sizing accuracy compared to VA, snare, and forceps across both clinical and pre-clinical settings. NMA supports VSE as the top-ranking modality, suggesting its potential to enhance decision-making in polypectomy and surveillance. Larger multi-center trials are needed for validation."

    "abstract": "Cancer is a complex dissipative system operating far from equilibrium, characterized by increased entropy production compared to normal tissues. Traditional thermodynamic approaches often fail to capture its full dynamics. In this study, we apply non-equilibrium stochastic thermodynamics to analyze different stages of carcinogenesis: neoplastic transformation (using the Avrami-Dobrzynski approach), tumor growth (described by the Gompertz model), and metastasis, in relation to tumor entropy and self-organization. Our results reveal a relationship between entropy production and tumor expansion rate, indicating that cellular reproduction enhances entropy generation. We also examine the information entropy of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that restricting external energy intake does not halt tumor progression, underscoring the resilience of cancer as an autonomous physical system. These findings highlight the thermodynamic nature of cancer and suggest that metastasis is an inevitable consequence of entropy-driven evolution."

    "abstract": "Living near green areas with high vegetation may contribute to an active lifestyle, stress reduction, and enhance social cohesion, and consequently may be associated with improved cancer survival. Epidemiologic studies focused on greenness exposure and cancer-specific mortality, specifically colorectal cancer (CRC)-specific mortality, are sparse. We examined the association between residential greenness at diagnosis and CRC-specific mortality. Using the Kentucky Cancer Registry database, 35,868 primary CRC cases diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2018 were followed until death or November 2020. Residential greenness exposure at diagnosis was estimated using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with 270m and 1230m buffers. Using Cox models, we estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of CRC-specific mortality and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by quartiles of greenness. We assessed effect modification using the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT). We observed 9,805 CRC-specific deaths over 208,098 person-years of follow-up. While crude assessments suggested an inverse relationship between NDVI quartiles and CRC-specific mortality, the association was null after adjustment for individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics (270m Buffer aHR Quartile 4 versus Quartile 1: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.95, 1.08, p-trend = 0.65; 1230m Buffer aHR Quartile 4 versus Quartile 1: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.10, p-trend = 0.26). No effect modification was observed by urban/rural status, race, or neighborhood-level income, while modification by stage was observed for the 270m buffer (LRT p-value = 0.03). Our findings suggest that residing in greener areas was not associated with CRC-specific mortality. Future studies should consider additional greenness measures, greenness interactions, and residential changes over follow-up."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung cancer (LC) after lung transplantation (LTx) is a rare but severe complication whose treatment and outcomes remain unclear. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective observational cohort study included consecutive patients diagnosed between 2000-2023 with primary LC after LTx or heart-LTx. Patient characteristics, cancer stage, treatment modalities, and outcomes were analyzed. Survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods. We compared the cohort to control recipients without post-transplantation LC. RESULTS: Of 7313 recipients, 143 (2%) developed LC, after a median interval of 5.3 years. Fifty-five cancers (37%) were stage I disease and 53 (35%) metastatic disease. In 60 (42%) patients, curative-intent surgery, predominantly via a thoracotomy (79%) was performed and achieved R0 resection in 53/57 (93%) patients. Day-90 mortality was 5% after lobectomy and 33% after pneumonectomy. Of the 31 (21%) patients given curative-intent radiotherapy, three developed radiation-induced grade 3 or 4 lung toxicity. Median overall survival in patients with stage I, II, III, and IV disease was 83, 16, 10, and 6 months, respectively. Compared to controls, patients with LC were older at transplantation, had greater donor and recipient smoking exposure, and more often received single-LTx (43% vs. 16%). Of the 62 single-LTx recipients, 52 (84%) had LC in the native lung. CONCLUSIONS: Curative-intent surgical resection, when avoiding pneumonectomy, and radiotherapy yield good long-term survival in early-stage post-transplantation LC. The dramatic survival differences between early and advanced stages emphasize the critical importance of routine low-dose computed tomography screening in all recipients, notably after single-LTx."

    "abstract": "Surgical pathology reports provide essential diagnostic information critical for cancer staging, treatment planning, and cancer registry documentation. However, their writing styles and formats vary widely, reflecting each pathologist's stylistic choices, institutional norms, and inherited practices from residency training. When performing large-scale data analysis, this unstructured nature and variability across tumor types and institutions pose significant hurdles for automated data extraction. To overcome these challenges, we present a consensus-driven, reasoning-based framework that adapts multiple locally deployed large language models (LLMs) to extract both standard diagnostic variables (site, laterality, histology, stage, grade, and behavior) and organ-specific biomarkers. Each LLM generates structured outputs, accompanied by justifications, which are subsequently evaluated for accuracy and coherence by three separate reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1-large, Qwen3-32B, and QWQ-32B). Final consensus values are determined through aggregation. Board-certified pathologists conducted expert validation. This framework was applied to over 6,100 pathology reports from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) spanning 10 organ systems and 510 reports from Moffitt Cancer Center. For the TCGA dataset, automated evaluation demonstrated mean accuracy of 84.9%+/-7.3%, with histology (88%), site (87%), stage and behavior (84%) showing the highest extraction accuracy averaged across all models. Expert review of randomly selected 138 reports confirmed high agreement for behavior (100.0%), histology (99%), grade (96%), and site (95%) in the TCGA dataset, with slightly lower performance for stage (89%) and laterality (88%). In Moffitt Cancer Center reports (brain, breast, and lung), accuracy remained high (88.2%+/-7.2%), with behavior (99%), histology (97%), laterality (96%), grade (94%), and site (93%) achieving strong agreement. Biomarker extraction achieved 70.6%+/-7.9% overall accuracy, with TP53 (84%) on brain tumor, Ki-67 (68%) on breast cancer, and ROS1 (82%) on lung cancer showing highest accuracy. Inter-evaluator agreement analysis revealed high concordance (correlations >/= 0.93) across the three evaluation models. Statistical analyses revealed significant main effects of model type (F=1716.82, p<0.001), variable (F=3236.68, p<0.001), and organ system (F=1946.43, p<0.001), as well as model x variable x organ interactions (F=24.74, p<0.001), emphasizing the role of clinical context in model performance. These results highlight the potential of stratified, multi-organ evaluation frameworks with multi-evaluator consensus in LLM benchmarking for clinical applications. Overall, this consensus-based approach demonstrates that locally deployed LLMs can provide a transparent, accurate, and auditable solution for integration into real-world pathology workflows such as synoptic reporting and cancer registry abstraction."

    "abstract": "Long-standing diabetes mellitus (long-DM) (> 3 years) is associated with worse clinical outcomes in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic alterations may contribute to this association; however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the role of the tumor-suppressive long non-coding RNA MEG3 and related molecules in the development of PDAC with long-DM. A total of 117 patients who underwent surgical resection for PDAC at Hirosaki University Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Histopathological assessment followed WHO criteria and the Union for International Cancer Control tumor-node-metastasis classification. Promoter methylation of MEG3 was assessed via methylation-specific PCR using formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue. MEG3 expression levels were measured by qPCR. Additionally, proteomic profiling was performed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue samples. Among the 117 PDAC cases, patients with long-DM exhibited significantly poorer tumor differentiation and reduced cancer-specific survival. MEG3 promoter methylation was more prevalent in patients with long-DM. MEG3 methylation was correlated with reduced MEG3 expression, increased venous invasion, higher recurrence rates, and worse prognosis. Proteomic analysis and protein structure prediction tool revealed F11R as a potential downstream effector of MEG3. F11R protein expression levels were evaluated using semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry. Higher F11R expression was observed in long-DM patients correlating with poorly histological differentiation and unfavorable outcomes. PDAC patients showing simultaneous MEG3 methylation and F11R high expression were more likely to have long-DM, with additive effects of these changes and tumor recurrence. Our results demonstrated that MEG3 and its potential downstream regulator, F11R could be involved in PDAC progression, particularly in patients with long-DM. The findings underscore the clinical significance of epigenetic regulation in DM-related PDAC, suggesting novel targets such as MEG3 and F11R for potential therapeutic intervention."

Herein, we investigated whether PFS and ORR predicted OS results in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in advanced NSCLC. METHODS: ORR (OR(ORR),%ORR), OS (HR(OS),mOS) and PFS (HR(PFS),mPFS) data were collected from phase III RCTs investigating ICIs in advanced NSCLC. Linear regression, weighted by sample size, between surrogate endpoints and OS were calculated. The power of correlation was defined by the value of coefficient of determination R(2) (>/=0.7 strong, 0.69-0.50 moderate, <0.5 weak). RESULTS: Forty investigational arms of ICIs +/- chemotherapy (ChT) were identified for further investigation. Arm-level analysis revealed that mPFS had a strong correlation with mOS in all comparisons (R(2)=0.71), in ICIs+ChT trials (R(2)=0.81) and in first-line setting (R(2)=0.71). A weak correlation was found between mPFS-mOS (R(2)=0.48) in trials of ICIs without chemotherapy. Next, trial-level analysis revealed a weak correlation between HR(OS) and HR(PFS) in all different groups, except in ICIs+ChT trial (R(2)=0.60). In addition, based on arm-level analysis, mOS and %ORR had moderate correlation in all comparisons (R(2)=0.58), in ICIs+ChT (R(2)=0.58) or ICIs (R(2)=0.53). In trial-level analysis, OR(ORR) and HR(OS) had moderate correlation (R(2)=0.55) in first-line setting and a strong correlation in ICIs+ChT trials (R(2)=0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Across trials investigating ICIs in advanced NSCLC, PFS and ORR demonstrated various degrees of relationship with OS. Caution should be taken when efficacy of novel ICIs regimens is evaluated only using surrogate outcomes."

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer (CC) is the fourth most common malignancy among women worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for improved predictive, diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to enhance disease management and patient outcomes. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), perform various functions in transcriptional, translational and post-translational regulation. Aberrant expression of ncRNAs in CC has been closely associated with disease initiation and progression, underscoring their potential as key regulators of cervical tumorigenesis. Several lncRNAs, such as HOTAIR and PVT1, contribute to cervical tumorigenesis by promoting cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Likewise, circRNAs, such as circ_0018289, act as miRNA sponges, leading to the dysregulation of key target genes. Moreover, specific miRNAs, such as miR-20a and miR-21, promote CC progression (oncogenic miRNAs), whereas others, including miR-214 and miR-218, exhibit a tumor suppressor role. Importantly, many ncRNAs are detectable in body fluids, representing stable and minimally invasive biomarkers suitable for liquid biopsy. Thus, in this comprehensive narrative review, we map the range of candidate ncRNAs reported in the literature and discuss their predictive, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value, including their potential as circulating biomarkers in CC. We also highlight, as a future perspective, how integrated profiling approaches could guide research and support the development of non-invasive strategies for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, and therapy monitoring in CC."

    "abstract": "Despite therapeutic advancements in the management of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC), there is an unmet clinical need for patient-specific in vitro models that can predict responses to therapy and enhance our understanding of this heterogeneous disease. Here, we established biomimetic 3D in vitro models, termed tumouroids, that incorporate patient-derived tumour cells and a complex stroma to mimic the physiological tumour microenvironment. We isolated tumour cells from RCC surgical specimens (n=20) using a mechanical-enzymatic method. Two tumouroid types were manufactured: simple tumouroids consisting of patient-derived tumour cells, collagen and matrix proteins, and complex tumouroids that incorporated an additional stromal compartment populated with fibroblasts and endothelial cells. An important feature of tumouroids is that owing to fabrication via plastic compression their density mimics in vivo physiological tissue density. Patient-derived cells and tumouroids were characterised through immunofluorescence and histology to investigate resemblance to original tissues. Finally, tumouroids were subjected to treatment with Pazopanib (Votrient), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used in the treatment of advanced RCC. Patient-derived tumouroids maintained the expression of characteristic RCC protein markers: carbonic anydrase IX (CA9), cytokeratins (CK7, CK8&18) and EMT markers (alphaSMA). The subtype-specific histology of the original tumour, e.g., clear cell, was also preserved. We observed Pazopanib-induced cytotoxicity, as measured by ATP production, ranging from none to strong (40%) for individual patient-derived simple tumouroids (n=12). In complex tumouroids, endothelial networks were also disrupted. Overall, patient-derived tumouroids mimicked the original tissue and successfully reproduced the response signatures to TKIs. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: A significant number of renal cell carcinoma patients do not respond to targeted therapies or develop resistance and succumb to the disease. Here, we developed sophisticated 3D in vitro tumour models, termed tumouroids, from patient samples. Tumouroids mimic the original tumour and its microenvironment and elicit response to drugs that target both the tumour cells and the tumour microenvironment. This is a patient-specific in vitro tool that addresses the unmet clinical need for predicting an individual's response to therapy."

    "abstract": "X-ray-induced photodynamic therapy (X-PDT) shows significant promise in tumor treatments due to its unlimited tissue penetration but requires delivering sensitizers to tumors. Here, we engineered photosensitizer verteporfin (VP) and T-lymphokine-activated killer cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) inhibitor OTS964-encapsulated polymeric nanocarriers (VP/OTS964@NPs) for effective tumor X-PDT, molecule-targeted therapy and inducing robust antitumor immunity for synergistic immunotherapy of low immunogenic breast tumors and their lung metastases when combined with PD-L1 blockade. The VP/OTS964@NPs are monodisperse and can be disassembled to release drugs in response to high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the tumor microenvironment or generated during X-PDT. It can efficiently deliver drugs into the TOPK-high expression breast cancer cells, generate ROS and induce ICD effects. By i.v. injection, VP/OTS964@NPs efficiently accumulated in the breast tumors and effectively eradicated tumors upon X-PDT. Additionally, the VP/OTS964@NPs activated the systemic antitumor immune responses, significantly inhibited the distant breast tumors and the lung metastasis of breast tumors, and enhanced the survival rates in combination with PD-L1 blockade. This study presented a strategy for engineering nanocarriers for synergistic molecular therapy, tumor XDT and immunotherapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: X-PDT is a promising therapeutic modality for cancer treatment. However, its clinical application is hindered by the limited availability of suitable sensitizers and their insufficient tumor-targeting capability. This work aims to construct ROS-sensitive nanocarriers co-loaded with the photosensitizer verteporfin and the TOPK inhibitor OTS964 to achieve synergistic X-PDT for triple-negative breast cancer. By further activating antitumor immune responses, this strategy is designed to suppress the distant and metastatic breast tumors. Overall, this work provides both a nanodrug platform and a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of poorly immunogenic solid tumors."

    "abstract": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines have become a transformative approach in immunotherapy and have attracted significant attention owing to their unprecedented success in controlling COVID-19. With their ability to flexibly and specifically encode tumour-associated antigens, along with their favorable safety profiles and scalable manufacturing, mRNA vaccines represent a highly promising platform for cancer treatment. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and many of its subtypes are immunologically cold tumours, which has limited the progress of immunotherapy in this field. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of mRNA vaccines to reshape the tumour immune microenvironment in breast cancer. These vaccines can enhance antigen presentation, activate T cell responses, and convert immunologically cold tumours into immune-active ones. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in mRNA vaccine development for breast cancer with a focus on antigen selection, mRNA design, and delivery strategies. It also examines findings from both preclinical and clinical studies as well as recent progress in industrial development. Finally, we discuss the current challenges hindering the clinical translation and ethical considerations of mRNA vaccine technology and propose future directions to advance mRNA vaccine-based therapies for breast cancer."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the effects of different airway management strategies on perioperative immune cells in patients undergoing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) surgery. A total of 23 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the endotracheal intubation (ETT) group or the supraglottic airway device (SAD) group. Comprehensive mass cytometry analysis was performed on peripheral blood CD45+ cells to evaluate immune cell populations. The SAD group demonstrated significantly reduced consumption of neuromuscular blocking agents and opioid requirements compared to the ETT group, with comparable surgical parameters. Notably, the SAD group showed favorable trends in clinical recovery metrics such as analgesic requirements. The study highlights the impact of airway management techniques on immune function, suggesting that the SAD approach may better preserve immune cell populations during surgery. These findings contribute to understanding the early perioperative immune response in NSCLC patients and may inform clinical practices in anesthesia management."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin (DOX) is a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent for treating hematologic malignancies and breast cancer. However, its clinical application is limited by severe cardiotoxicity. Recent studies have suggested that mitochondrial dynamics play a central role in the pathogenesis of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC). This study was designed to evaluate whether ursolic acid (UA) can mitigate DIC and elucidate the underlying mechanisms related to mitochondrial fission and oxidative stress. METHODS: A chronic DOX-induced cardiotoxicity model was established via the intraperitoneal administration of DOX (5 mg/kg/week), while ursolic acid was administered intragastrically (50 mg/kg/day). Echocardiography and histological staining were employed to assess the protective effects of ursolic acid on DOX-induced cardiac injury. RESULTS: Ursolic acid treatment significantly improved cardiac function following DOX exposure. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the amelioration of mitochondrial dysfunction. Western blotting demonstrated that ursolic acid markedly reduced the DOX-induced increase in the level of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) phosphorylated at Ser616 (p-DRP1(S616)), suggesting its role in attenuating excessive mitochondrial fission. Furthermore, co-treatment with Mitochondrial Division Inhibitor 1 (Mdivi-1) further suppressed p-DRP1 (S616) expression, reinforcing the notion that ursolic acid mitigates DIC by inhibiting DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission and oxidative stress. The upstream mechanism was explored, with evidence suggesting that the C5a-C5a1 receptor axis mediates p-DRP1(S616) phosphorylation. Western blot analysis revealed significant upregulation of the C5a and C5a1 receptors in the DIC model. The C5a1 receptor agonist BM213 abolished the protective effects of ursolic acid, indicating that ursolic acid exerts its cardioprotective effect by inhibiting the C5a-C5aR1-DRP1(S616) pathway. CONCLUSION: Ursolic acid confers protection against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by improving mitochondrial function through the inhibition of DRP1-mediated excessive mitochondrial fission and oxidative stress."

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer remains one of the most aggressive and fatal gynecologic malignancies, primarily due to its asymptomatic onset, early metastatic potential, frequent resistance to conventional therapies, and the absence of effective tools for early detection and prognostic assessment. As a result, sensitive, specific and minimally invasive biomarkers are urgently needed to enable earlier detection, more accurate prediction of clinical outcomes and ongoing monitoring of therapeutic response. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are endogenous RNA molecules formed by covalent backsplice junctions that render them highly resistant to exonuclease degradation. Many circRNAs serve as competitive endogenous RNAs that sequester microRNAs. This sequestration modulates key oncogenic signaling cascades, ultimately regulating cellular proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Their exceptional stability, measurable abundance in body fluids and distinctive dysregulation in pathological states highlight their potential as both diagnostic and prognostic indicators. In fact, biomarker panels based on circRNA expression have achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.923 for ovarian cancer detection. Individually, specific circRNAs have been shown to correlate with overall survival, histologic grade, tumor burden and other clinicopathologic features. In this review, by surveying all relevant data in major databases without language restrictions, we comprehensively update and analyze the latest molecular and clinical findings on the diagnostic and prognostic value of circRNAs in patients with ovarian cancer."

    "abstract": "The macromolecule COMP -Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein- was originally discovered as an essential regulator of the assembly, integrity and homeostatic remodeling of cartilage tissue ECMs. Later, however, it was found to have a more widespread distribution, to attain different subcellular topographies and play a pivotal role as an integral component of fibrotic and cancer-associated matrices. The homopentameric configuration of COMP remains distinctive within the human proteome and confers to the protein a multivalent functionality exploitable by the cells under physiological and pathological conditions. The structural-functional properties of COMP show limited overlap with those of other members of thrombospondin family and its multifaceted nature extends beyond its function in matrix assembly to embrace signal transducing interactions with the cell surface, the sequestering of signaling molecules, and the binding of components of the immunological/complement system. Mutated chondrocyte variants of COMP and isoforms aberrantly expressed by transformed cells are retained intracellularly to engage interactions with a variety of cytoplasmic molecules and convert the macromolecule from a structural ECM component to a regulator of homeostatic and transformative events. We discuss here how the unique structural traits of COMP may endow it with multifunctionality and explain its active participation in highly diverse biological processes."

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the deadliest cancers, ranking third in cancer incidence worldwide. These tumor cells often adopt unique strategies under chemotherapeutic stress to attain a reversible drug-tolerant state and evade cell death. However, the molecular adaptations associated with this transitory emergence of the drug-tolerant state remain elusive. Herein, epigenetic alterations often dictate such reversible dynamic changes, and this study aims to characterize the role of specific epigenetic modifiers governing CRC cell survival under cisplatin exposure and their subsequent relapse. We observed that under cisplatin-stress there is a drastic increase in the histone-repressive mark-H3K27me3, linked to an enhanced expression of EZH2, driving transcriptional inhibition of cell proliferation-associated genes and a proliferative arrest. Interestingly, cisplatin-induced oxidative stress increased the expression of P65 protein, which was found to interact with and regulate EZH2 expression. Quenching of ROS, cisplatin-rescue, or P65 inactivation compromised EZH2 activity, concurrent with a re-initiation of cell proliferation. Interestingly, this reversal to proliferative state was associated with an elevated activity of the histone lysine demethylase-KDM6A. The promoter elements of the proliferative genes were now occupied by KDM6A instead of EZH2. Accordingly, a genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of KDM6A in vitro not only resulted in increased cell death but also prevented emergence of the re-proliferative CRC cells. Furthermore, KDM6A inhibition in combination with cisplatin, resulted in an increased tumor regression in vivo. Our study thus highlights the importance of KDM6A as a therapeutic target in preventing CRC growth and relapse which can have future therapeutic implications."

    "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a critical role in tumor progression by regulating cancer cell behavior, invasion and metastasis. This importance has motivated the development of biomaterials that closely mimic the native tumor ECM to create more accurate and predictive in vitro cancer models. In this study, oxidized cellulose nanofibrils (OCNF) are used as a simple three-dimensional scaffold for breast tumor spheroid expansion. OCNF forms a highly dynamic hydrogel in cell culture medium with rheological properties suitable for modeling early breast tumor ECM. This dynamic environment enables MCF-7 cells to form spheroids within 6 days and to continue proliferating for up to 12 days. Co-culture of MCF-7 cells with fibroblasts further models the tumor microenvironment with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Because the hydrogel is held together by non-covalent interactions, adding extra cell culture medium and pipetting converts it into a fluid-like state, facilitating spheroid release and collection for downstream applications such as drug screening and penetration studies. Overall, this work demonstrates a facile approach for preparing tumor spheroids using cellulose nanofibril hydrogels and may inspire further innovations in biomedical applications of cellulose hydrogels."

    "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), fatal outcomes predominantly result from metastatic dissemination, highlighting an urgent need for metastasis-directed therapies. Amentoflavone (AMF), a natural biflavonoid found in Ginkgo biloba and other medicinal plants, exhibits known antitumor activity. However, its role in NSCLC metastasis and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the anti-metastatic effects of AMF from Ginkgo biloba in NSCLC and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A network pharmacology approach combined with machine learning was used to predict AMF targets and derive a core diagnostic gene signature. Molecular docking and 100-ns molecular dynamics simulations were performed to characterize AMF-target binding and stability. In vitro, NSCLC cell migration was assessed using wound-healing (scratch) assays and Transwell migration chambers, with mechanistic insights obtained by Western blot analysis of EMT-related proteins. In vivo efficacy was evaluated in a murine pulmonary metastasis model established via tail-vein tumor cell injection. The machine learning model achieved an AUC of 0.951 in the internal testing set and 0.814 in the external validation set (GSE31210), indicating high robustness. RESULTS: Convergent computational analyses identified TGFBR2 as a key candidate target of AMF. Docking and 100-ns MD simulations predicted a strong and dynamically stable binding mode of AMF to TGFBR2. In vitro, AMF significantly reduced NSCLC cell migration, accompanied by downregulation of TGFBR2 and inhibition of Smad2/3 phosphorylation, which collectively reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Consistently, AMF suppressed NSCLC metastasis in vivo by inhibiting the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that AMF functions as an anti-metastatic agent in NSCLC at least in part by downregulating TGFBR2, thereby dampening TGF-beta/Smad signaling and preventing EMT. These findings highlight AMF as a promising natural candidate for developing anti-metastatic therapies that appear well tolerated under the conditions tested."

    "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Bojungikki-tang (BJIKT), a traditional East-Asian multi-herbal prescription known for enhancing immune function, treating chronic fatigue, and improving general vitality, is often prescribed for conditions related to immune deficiency or cancer-related fatigue. However, its cellular mechanisms remain poorly defined. AIM OF THE STUDY: To determine whether BJIKT promotes M1-like macrophage activation and exerts antitumor effects, particularly with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and elucidate the underlying signaling mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into M0 macrophages using PMA and treated with BJIKT alone or with IFN-gamma. Expression of M1/M2 markers and pro-inflammatory cytokines was assessed using RT-qPCR and ELISA. TLR4 signaling involvement was evaluated using the selective inhibitor TAK-242. Conditioned media (CM) from treated macrophages were applied to A549 lung cancer cells, followed by MTT, LDH, and Annexin V/7-AAD assays to assess antitumor activity. Individual herbs and BJIKT phytochemicals were also tested for cytokine-inducing potential. RESULTS: BJIKT alone increased the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) but did not induce full M1 polarization-co-treatment with IFN-gamma markedly upregulated M1 genes, including CD80 and TNF-alpha. TAK-242 inhibited IFN-gamma/LPS-induced cytokine and suppressed IFN-gamma/BJIKT-induced effects, suggesting partial TLR4 dependence. CM from BJIKT/IFN-gamma-treated macrophages reduced A549 cell viability, increased cytotoxicity, and induced apoptosis. Notably, Ginseng Radix and Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma partially mimicked BJIKT, while major phytochemicals showed no comparable activity. CONCLUSIONS: BJIKT synergistically promotes M1-like macrophage activation through partial TLR4 dependence and elicits antitumor effects via macrophage-derived cytokines. These findings provide insight into how a traditional multi-herbal formula can influence macrophage activation and cytokine-mediated antitumor responses."

    "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a major etiological factor in diverse gastric pathologies, accounting for approximately 75 % of gastric cancer cases. Current clinical antibiotic therapy faces significant challenges due to drug resistance, gastric acid degradation, and the formidable barriers of gastric mucus and biofilm matrix. To tackle these challenges, antibiotic-loaded nanomotors were developed for self-propelled penetration through gastric mucus and biofilm matrix to achieve H. pylori eradication. Specifically, Janus-structured J-Ca/Si@PDA-CLR nanoparticles (NPs) were fabricated by sequentially depositing mesoporous silica layers onto CaO(2) NPs and asymmetrically coating them with clarithromycin (CLR)-loaded polydopamine (PDA). CaO(2) reacted with gastric acid and produced O(2), combined with the intrinsic Janus coating, generates an asymmetrical protrusion force, enabling effective mucus penetration and preventing premature gastric emptying. The protection of mesoporous silica layers ensures long-term motion, more rapid and complete penetration across mucus layers, and deep infiltration into biofilms, enhancing drug retention in the stomach and targeted accumulation within biofilms. Following intragastrical administration in H. pylori-infected mice, the nanomotors exhibited efficient infiltration into submucosal tissues and deep distribution throughout the stomach wall, in stark contrast to their static counterparts confined to the gastric surface. Treatment with the nanomotors resulted in an 8000-fold reduction in gastric bacterial burden compared to static carriers. Remarkably, nanomotors given at half the CLR dose produced a 75-fold higher bactericidal effect compared to free CLR at twice the dose. Thus, this work establishes a feasible therapeutic strategy utilizing self-propelled NPs to overcome mucus barriers and achieve deep biofilm clearance, demonstrating significant potential for applications in treating biofilm-associated infections."

However, the role of upstream regulators and post-translational mechanisms regulating signal-induced proliferation-associated 1 (SIPA1) stability in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate novel deubiquitinases that directly bind to and stabilize SIPA1 based on its catalytic activity, along with their underlying action mechanisms. Notably, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L3 (UCHL3) was identified as the novel deubiquitinase. Mechanistically, UCHL3 removed K48-linked polyubiquitin chains from SIPA1 at lysine 805, protecting it from proteasomal degradation. In contrast, the E3 ligase itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (ITCH) promoted SIPA1 ubiquitination and degradation, acting antagonistically to UCHL3. Furthermore, UCHL3 enhanced CRC cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis through a SIPA1-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, tripartite motif-containing protein 21 regulated UCHL3 post-translationally by targeting UCHL3 for proteasomal degradation. Clinically, UCHL3 and SIPA1 were found to be upregulated in CRC tissues, whereas ITCH was downregulated, with their expression correlating with poor patient prognosis. Altogether, the findings of this study reveal the novel UCHL3-ITCH-SIPA1 regulatory axis that modulates oncogenic signaling and CRC progression, offering new insights into the post-translational regulation of SIPA1 and identifying potential therapeutic targets."

    "abstract": "The designation of Gleason score 6 (ISUP Grade Group 1) prostate cancer as \"cancer\" has become increasingly controversial. Despite its excellent prognosis and minimal risk of metastasis, the diagnosis often leads to emotional distress and potential overtreatment. The question of whether a less alarming nomenclature might be more appropriate is gaining relevance. This review analyses the arguments for and against renaming ISUP Grade Group 1 prostate cancer and explains why the definition of indolence cannot be based solely on histological criteria. Drawing on current literature and consensus statements from international pathology societies (ISUP/GUPS), this article critically evaluates pathological, clinical, molecular, and imaging criteria used to define tumour indolence. Neither morphological characteristics, nor molecular markers, nor imaging alone can reliably identify indolent cancers in biopsy specimens. Diagnostic uncertainty is further amplified by significant interobserver variability. Multidisciplinary approaches that integrate clinical, radiological, molecular, and histopathological parameters appear necessary to accurately detect and classify indolent tumours. Simply renaming GG1 prostate cancer using a less threatening term is insufficient. Instead, individualised, multidimensional risk stratification is essential. The debate underscores that the responsibility for defining indolent prostate cancer cannot rest solely with pathology."

A high prevalence of inflammatory prostate disorders exists without a clearly identifiable cause. This article aimed to investigate the potential association between periodontal status and prognosis in men diagnosed with prostatitis and to evaluate whether oral health influences urological treatment outcomes.A cross-sectional clinical study was conducted on 172 adult patients with prostatitis who provided written informed consent. Participants were assigned to two groups based on bleeding index (BI): Group A (GA, n = 84), BI >7%, and Group B (GB, n = 88), BI </=7%. All subjects underwent comprehensive periodontal assessment and nonsurgical periodontal therapy, with follow-up at 30 and 120 days.At baseline, GA showed significantly greater probing depths on proximal surfaces and higher BI values than GB (p < 0.01). Posttreatment, BI improved significantly in both groups, although GA maintained higher residual bleeding (p = 0.002). Mean posttreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels did not differ significantly between groups; however, PSA decreases occurred more frequently in GB (61.5%) than in GA (28.6%, p = 0.039), while PSA increases were more common in GA (57.1% vs. 15.4%, p = 0.005). Overall, 29.4% of patients exhibited lower PSA levels after periodontal therapy.While no direct association was found between periodontal status and absolute posttreatment PSA values, healthier periodontal conditions were linked to more favorable PSA trends. These findings suggest that periodontal health may contribute to PSA stability in men with prostatitis. Larger, longitudinal studies are warranted to clarify potential mechanistic links between oral and prostatic inflammation."

While conventional treatment modalities are effective in eliminating cancer cells, they frequently result in adverse side effects. Research continues to explore plant-based therapeutics with selective cytotoxicity against cancer cells. Goniothalamus umbrosus is traditionally used among medicinal folks and has shown potential in its anticancer properties. This study aims to explore the role of G. umbrosus hexane extract (GUHE) in inducing apoptosis by elucidating its mechanism of action in OSCC (HSC-3) while comparing its effect on human gingival fibroblast (HGF) cells.The expression of proapoptotic gene (Bax) and antiapoptotic gene (Bcl-2) in HSC-3 and HGF cell lines that had been pretreated with GUHE was evaluated by RT-qPCR. The activity of caspase-3 protein was quantified by ELISA assay.RT-qPCR analysis revealed that GUHE significantly upregulated the Bax expression by 1.69-fold and downregulated Bcl-2 expression by 42% in the HSC-3 cell line. The activity of caspase-3 protein was significantly increased in HSC-3 treated with GUHE. The expression of Bax and Bcl-2 genes and caspase-3 protein activity was not significantly modulated in GUHE-treated HGF.GUHE selectively induced apoptosis by activating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in the HSC-3 cell line without being detrimental to the HGF cell line. This highlights its promising effect as a targeted therapeutic agent for OSCC therapy."

    "abstract": "Base mutations (mismatches, insertions, or deletions) in microRNAs (miRNAs) are frequently associated with diseases including as cancer, where they significantly alter miRNA structure and function. However, the accurately detection of low-abundance mutants amid highly similar sequences remains a major challenge. In this study, we developed a sensing strategy based on the ionic current and hybridization free energy, which employs glass micropipette channels functionalized with polydopamine nanotubes (PDA-NTs) and peptide nucleic acids (PNA), which enables enzyme-free, high-resolution identification of low-abundance miRNA-21 base mutations. The detection mechanism relies on mutation-induced conformational changes during PNA-miRNA hybridization, which modulate nanopore ion permeability and produce distinct current signatures. By correlating these signals with hybridization Gibbs free energy (DeltaG), we established a link between thermodynamic stability and current response. When DeltaDeltaG > 1 kcal/mol, a segmented linear relationship was observed between DeltaDeltaG and the normalized current decrease Delta[(I(0)-I(C))/I(0)], allowing precise discrimination of mutant types, numbers, and locations based on ionic current response. In contrast, when DeltaDeltaG < 1 kcal/mol, the signal change Delta[(I(0)-I(C))/I(0)] remained below 5%, making it challenging to differentiate mutants from the wild-type. This portable highly sensitive miRNA mutation sensing strategy offers strong potential for rapid molecular diagnostics and clinical decision-making."
